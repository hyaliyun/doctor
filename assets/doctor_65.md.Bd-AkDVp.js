Methods By using grounded theory, we conducted semi-structured, open-ended telephone/skype interviews of emergency physicians and geriatric providers recruited from a purposeful sampling technique. The interviews were transcribed and reviewed by two investigators. The codes were generated and listed, and common concepts emerged. Lastly, the final codes were organized into concepts and themes with the aim to create a strong coding structure. Result The main lessons learned are: (1) understand the hospitals existing local environment and resources, (2) utilize champions and interdisciplinary teams, (3) acknowledge that specific fall assessment tools and interventions vary widely between institutions, (4) engage in routine plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to improve the quality of fall initiatives, and (5) operate under the principle that falls are a syndrome, which must be incorporated within the multifactorial medical needs of geriatric fall patients. Conclusion Based on the lessons learned from our ED fall implementation pioneers, implementing an effective geriatric fall protocol in an ED setting is complicated. Understanding a hospitals resources, assigning champions, working as an interdisciplinary team, choosing proper fall assessment tools/interventions, and completing regular PDSA cycles are important lessons for ED programs planning to implement their own ED fall programs.","output":"Lessons Learned From Emergency Department Fall Assessment and Prevention Programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discoveries can, when used appropriately, save lives.

To cope with this emergency, the COVID-19 Lombardy intensive care units (ICU) network was created. The network identified the need of defining a list of clinical recommendations to standardize treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Three core topics were identified: 1) rational use of intensive care resources; 2) ventilation strategies; 3) non-ventilatory interventions. Identification of patients who may benefit from ICU treatment is challenging. Clinicians should consider baseline performance and frailty status and they should adopt disease-specific staging tools. Continuous positive airway pressure, mainly delivered through a helmet as elective method, should be considered as initial treatment for all patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19. In case of persisting dyspnea and/or desaturation despite 4-6 hours of noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered. In the early phase, muscle relaxant use and volume-controlled ventilation is recommended. Prone position should be performed in patients with PaO2/FiO2100 mmHg.

The posterior circulation represents a difficult therapeutic dilemma because of the close proximity of crucial life-sustaining brainstem structures. The use of flow diverter technology has been very limited in posterior circulation vessels. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We present the case of a 49-year-old female patient, who was diagnosed with a symptomatic large vertebrobasilar junction aneurysm, which was initially thought to be a proximal basilar dilatation. The aneurysm was later verified to arise from the proximal end of a basilar fenestration, distended by the aneurysm fundus. The small-caliber fenestration limbs were the only connection to the distal basilar artery, but were stretched laterally and concealed by the aneurysm fundus. This complex lesion was successfully treated by flow diverter deployment through one of the fenestration limbs, followed by coiling of the aneurysm fundus, and sacrificing the contralateral vertebral artery. A 6-month follow-up angiogram showed remodeling of the basilar artery and complete occlusion of the aneurysm with good clinical outcome. Careful diagnostic workup, multidisciplinary discussions, and the innovative use of versatile endovascular technology were crucial to achieve an optimal result in this case. CONCLUSION This is the first report of a successful basilar artery reconstruction for the treatment of a large atypical vertebrobasilar junction fenestration aneurysm by deployment of a flow diverter device directly in a small, obscured fenestration limb.","output":"Fenestra Obscura: Flow Diverter Reconstruction of a Complex Vertebrobasilar Aneurysm Through an Obscured Fenestration Limb: Technical Case Report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than $h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\\\\%$ rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\\\\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.","output":"The disease-induced herd immunity level for Covid-19 is substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the second in a two\\\\part review of diagnostic cytopathology in veterinary medicine.

Quality evaluation was carried out for papers meeting the inclusion criteria using six items from the Downs and Black assessment checklist. The STATA statistical software version 15.1 was hired to perform meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine records with a total of 24,952 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The results of this meta-analysis revealed that the pooled effect value of COVID-19 vaccination willingness among HCWs using a random-effects model was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.62). Male, aged 30 years or older, having a history of prior influenza vaccination were facilitators for HCWs intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.37-2.41, P=0.000, I(2)=59.4%; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16-1.51, P=0.000, I(2)=31.7%; OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.82-4.84, P=0.000, I(2)=88.1%).

PARTICIPANTS: We used mortality data at the county level from 2005 to 2017 from the National Center for Health Statistics. OUTCOME: Opioid overdose deaths were defined using underlying and contributory causes of death codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). We used the underlying cause of death to identify all drug poisoning deaths. Contributory cause of death was used to classify opioid overdose deaths according to the three major types of opioid, that is, prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone. RESULTS: Opioid overdose deaths were disproportionally higher in largely populated CZs. A CZ with 1.0% larger population had 1.10%, 1.10%, and 1.16% higher opioid death count in 2005C2009, 2010C2014, and 2015C2017, respectively. This pattern was largely driven by a high number of deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids, particularly in 2015C2017. Population growth over time was associated with lower age-adjusted opioid overdose mortality rate: a 1.0% increase in population over time was associated with 1.4% (95% CI: ?2.8% to 0.1%), 4.5% (95% CI: ?5.8% to ?3.2%), and 1.2% (95% CI: ?4.2% to 1.8%) lower opioid overdose mortality in 2005C2009, 2010C2014, and 2015C2017, respectively.

The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare. Genome sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants and proteome analysis suggest that resistance is mediated by downregulation of the bacterial EIIBC phosphotransferase components scrA and mtlA in MRSA likely leading to a lower uptake of the molecules.

Both modulate resistance to drugs that act in the food vacuole. To investigate the formation and behaviour of the food vacuole membrane we have generated inducible GFP fusions of chloroquine sensitive and resistant forms of the PfCRT protein. The inducible expression system allowed us to follow newly-induced fusion proteins, and corroborated a previous report of a direct trafficking route from the ER/Golgi to the food vacuole membrane. These parasites also allowed the definition of a food vacuole compartment in ring stage parasites well before haemozoin crystals were apparent, as well as the elucidation of secondary PfCRT-labelled compartments adjacent to the food vacuole in late stage parasites. We demonstrated that in addition to previously demonstrated Brefeldin A sensitivity, the trafficking of PfCRT is disrupted by Dynasore, a non competitive inhibitor of dynamin-mediated vesicle formation. Chloroquine sensitivity was not altered in parasites over-expressing chloroquine resistant or sensitive forms of the PfCRT fused to GFP, suggesting that the PfCRT does not mediate chloroquine transport as a GFP fusion protein.","output":"Investigation of the Plasmodium falciparum Food Vacuole through Inducible Expression of the Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus outbreak is a rapidly evolving pandemic, placing unprecedented strain on health-care systems COVID-19 presents challenges for management of children with renal diseases especially those receiving long-term immunosuppressive medications, including renal transplant recipients and those with chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis Our preparedness for managing this vulnerable group of children is the need of the hour The purpose of this article is to provide guidance to caregivers and health care personnel involved in management of children with renal diseases and to ensure patient well-being, while protecting staff from infection","output":"Managing Children with Renal Diseases during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) isolates that have been adapted to passage in cell culture maintain their infectivity in vitro but may lose their pathogenicity in vivo.

Pairwise comparison at both the nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) levels between virulent and attenuated TGEV strains identified a common change in nt 1753 of the spike gene, resulting in a serine to alanine mutation at aa position 585 of the spike proteins of the attenuated TGEV strains. Alanine was also present in this protein in PRCV-ISU-1. Particularly noteworthy, the serine to alanine mutation resides in the region of the major antigenic site A/B (aa 506-706) that elicites neutralizing antibodies and within the domain mediating the cell surface receptor aminopeptidase N binding (aa 522-744). Comparison of the predicted polypeptide products of ORF3b showed significant deletions in the naturally attenuated PRCV ISU-1 and TGEV Miller M60; these deletions occurred at a common break point, suggesting a related mechanism of recombination that may affect viral virulence or tropism.

Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the integrity of the biological, mechanical and immunological gut barrier. Specifically, microbiota diversity and beneficial bacteria population are reduced, concurrently with overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (dysbiosis). Enterocytes tight junctions (TJs) are disrupted, and the apoptotic death of intestinal epithelial cells is increased leading to increased gut permeability. In addition, mucosal CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Th17 cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages are activated, and T-regulatory cells are decreased, thus promoting an overactivated immune response, which further injures the intestinal epithelium. This dysfunctional gut barrier in SARS-CoV-2 infection permits the escape of luminal bacteria, fungi and endotoxin to normally sterile extraintestinal sites and the systemic circulation. Pre-existing gut barrier dysfunction and endotoxemia in patients with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and immunosuppression predisposes to aggravated endotoxemia.

Results: : Experimental results on four metrics -- mean absolute error (MAE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) -- showed significant improvement of the synthetic CT compared to the original CBCT data. The MAE and RMSE improvement percentages are 64.44% and 66.44%.The MAE level of synthetic CT for most of the tissues are small enough to separate most important tissues,including dentin and cancellous bone, dentin and root canalimplants and cortical bone. Conclusions: : CBCT and synthetic CT values can be used to distinguish different high-attenuation structures that are of interest to dentists. The application of CBCT assisted by this U-net based network in medical imaging of other parts of the body is promising.","output":"Comparison of Gray Values of Cone-beam Computed Tomography With Hounsfield Units of Multislice Computed Tomography Using a U-net Based Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people are being hospitalized and are dying from COVID-19 as the right treatment has not yet been identified. We investigate the factors related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 using big data-machine learning techniques. This retrospective study included 8070 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients of the 129,120 SARS-CoV-2 RNA tested patients in South Korea between January and July 2020, and whose data were available from the National Health Insurance Service. Primary endpoint was comorbidity, severity and mortality rate in COVID-19. Machine learning algorithms were performed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities on severity and mortality rate of COVID-19. The most common comorbidities of COVID-19 were pulmonary inflammation followed by anosmia. The model that best predicted severity was a neural network (AUC: 85.06%). The most important variable for predicting severity in the neural network model was a history of influenza (relative importance: 0.129). The model that best predicted mortality was the logistic regression elastic net (EN) model (AUC: 93.86%). The most important variables for mortality in the EN model were age (coefficient: 2.136) and anosmia (coefficient: C1.438). Through the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and 8070 patients of COVID-19 patients in South Korea, influenza was found to be a major adverse factor in addition to old age and male sex. In addition, anosmia was found to be a major factor associated with lower severity and mortality rates.

However, the temperature dependencies of optical transitions, especially those related to band nesting, were not analyzed in detail for many of them. Here, we present successful studies utilizing the photoreflectance method, which, due to its derivative and absorption-like character, allows investigating direct optical transitions at the high-symmetry point of the Brillouin zone and band nesting. By studying the mentioned optical transitions with temperature from 20 to 300 K, we tracked changes in the electronic band structure for the common transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), namely, MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2. Moreover, transmission and photoacoustic spectroscopies were also employed to investigate the indirect gap in these crystals. For all observed optical transitions assigned to specific k-points of the Brillouin zone, their temperature dependencies were analyzed using the Varshni relation and Bose-Einstein expression. It was shown that the temperature energy shift for the transition associated with band nesting is smaller when compared with the one at high-symmetry point, revealing reduced average electron-phonon interaction strength.","output":"Temperature Dependence of the Indirect Gap and the Direct Optical Transitions at the High-Symmetry Point of the Brillouin Zone and Band Nesting in MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2 Crystals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the clinical characteristics of two adult patients, presenting with a typical erythematous rash consistent with rubella disease after MMR vaccination.

While social media can serve as a useful tool for effective communication during disease outbreaks, few studies have elucidated how these platforms are used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) during disease outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: Guided by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication model, this study aimed to explore the MOHs use of Twitter and the publics engagement during different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Tweets and corresponding likes and retweets were extracted from the official Twitter account of the MOH in Saudi Arabia for the period of January 1 through August 31, 2020. Tweets related to COVID-19 were identified; subsequently, content analysis was performed, in which tweets were coded for the following message types: risk messages, warnings, preparations, uncertainty reduction, efficacy, reassurance, and digital health responses. Public engagement was measured by examining the numbers of likes and retweets. The association between outbreak stages and types of messages was assessed, as well as the effect of these messages on public engagement. RESULTS: The MOH posted a total of 1393 original tweets during the study period. Of the total tweets, 1293 (92.82%) were related to COVID-19, and 1217 were ultimately included in the analysis. The MOH posted the majority of its tweets (65.89%) during the initial stage of the outbreak. Accordingly, the public showed the highest level of engagement (as indicated by numbers of likes and retweets) during the initial stage. The types of messages sent by the MOH significantly differed across outbreak stages, with messages related to uncertainty reduction, reassurance, and efficacy being prevalent among all stages. Tweet content, media type, and crisis stage influenced the level of public engagement. Engagement was negatively associated with the inclusion of hyperlinks and multimedia files, while higher level of public engagement was associated with the use of hashtags. Tweets related to warnings, uncertainty reduction, and reassurance received high levels of public engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into the Saudi MOHs communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results have implications for researchers, governments, health organizations, and practitioners with regard to their communication practices during outbreaks. To increase public engagement, governments and health authorities should consider the publics need for information. This, in turn, could raise public awareness regarding disease outbreaks.","output":"The Saudi Ministry of Healths Twitter Communication Strategies and Public Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The 2019C2020 outbreak of novel coronavirus has raised concerns about nosocomial transmission. This reviews aim was to explore the existing literature on emerging infectious disease outbreaks to identify factors associated with compliance with infection control measures among healthcare staff. METHODS: A rapid evidence review for primary studies relevant to healthcare workers compliance with infection control measures. RESULTS: Fifty-six papers were reviewed. Staff working in emergency or intensive care settings or with contact with confirmed cases appeared more likely to comply with recommendations. There was some evidence that anxiety and concern about the risk of infection were more associated with compliance, and that monitoring from superiors could improve compliance. Observed non-compliance of colleagues could hinder compliance. Staff identified many barriers to compliance related to personal protective equipment, including availability, perceived difficulty and effectiveness, inconvenience, discomfort and a negative impact on patient care. There were many issues regarding the communication and ease of understanding of infection control guidance. CONCLUSION: We recommend provision of training and education tailored for different occupational roles within the healthcare setting, managerial staff leading by example, ensuring adequate resources for infection control and timely provision of practical evidence-based infection control guidelines.","output":"Factors affecting healthcare workers compliance with social and behavioural infection control measures during emerging infectious disease outbreaks: rapid evidence review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shrimp farming is fundamental to the national economy of Bangladesh particularly through earning foreign currency.

All patients were followed by the neonatologist in the neonatal intensive care unit during the preoperative and postoperative period. Results: Thirty-eight (66.7%) patients had intact ventricular septum, 16 (28.1%) had ventricular septal defect, two (3.5%) had coarctation of the aorta, and one (1.7%) had Taussig-Bing anomaly. Coronary artery anomaly was present in 14 (24.5%) patients. The most common complications in the intensive care unit were renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis in seven (12.3%) patients, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in six (10.5%) patients, and eight (14%) patients left their chests open. The median length of stay in intensive care unit was 13.8 (range, 9 to 25) days and the median length of hospital stay was 24.5 (range, 16 to 47) days. The overall mortality rate for all patients was 12.3% (n=7). The median follow-up was 8.2 months. A pulmonary valve peak Doppler gradient of =36 mmHg was detected in five patients (8.7%) who were followed, and these patients were monitored by providing medical treatment. None of the patients needed reoperation or reintervention.

This has resulted in various difficult experiences which includes financial loss, separation from loved ones, grief, uncertainty over disease status and loss of freedom. During these stressful situations, interpersonal violence is likely to be aggravated. To avoid the occurrence of adverse events such as impulsive acts, homicide, or suicide, it is important to identify high-risk individuals. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, online survey by convenience sampling. The prevalence of different types of interpersonal violence with socio-demographic factors, substance use, and overall mental wellbeing was assessed by using descriptive statistical tests. RESULTS: Out of total 556 participants included in the analysis, 50.9% (283) were male and 48.7% (271) were female. There were 100 (18.0%) participants who reported being a victim of interpersonal violence and 101 (18.2%) participants who reported being a perpetrator during the lockdown. The victims of violence were more likely to be living with their spouse alone. The victims and perpetrators were also more likely to have increased alcohol and tobacco use. More number of victims and perpetrators had lower mental wellbeing scores on the WHO wellbeing index. CONCLUSIONS: There was prevalence of interpersonal violence during the COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to the fear regarding pandemic, victims have to face domestic violence placing them at a double injustice. Identification of vulnerable groups and proper management of survivors must be prioritized given the unanimous consensus on the rise of interpersonal violence during periods of heightened stress.","output":"Interpersonal Violence during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Nepal: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in healthcare worldwide. Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) in infected patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with new-onset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. A group with new-onset AF (n = 12) was compared with a control group (total: n = 148, sinus rhythm: n = 118, previous AF: n = 30). New-onset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction. This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events (41.7% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001), bleeding (33.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.005), a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death (58.3 vs. 19.6%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (16.4 vs. 8.6 days, p < 0.001), with no differences in all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, adjusted by potential confounding factors, new-onset AF demonstrated a 14.26 odds ratio for thromboembolism (95% confidence interval 2.86-71.10, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New-onset AF in COVID-19 patients presumably has a notable impact on prognosis. The appearance of new-onset AF is related to worse cardiovascular outcomes, considering it as an independent predictor of embolic events.

However, this system is composed of organs that are extremely complex. Among the different parts, the intestine is viewed as an incredible surface of contact with the environment and is colonised by hundreds of trillions of gut microbes. The role of the gut barrier has been studied for decades, but the exact mechanisms involved in the protection of the gut barrier are various and complementary. Among them, the integrity of the mucus barrier is one of the first lines of protection of the gastrointestinal tract. In the past, this 'slimy' partner was mostly considered a simple lubricant for facilitating the progression of the food bolus and the stools in the gut. Since then, different researchers have made important progress, and currently, the regulation of this mucus barrier is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community. Among the factors influencing the mucus barrier, the microbiome plays a major role in driving mucus changes. Additionally, our dietary habits (ie, high-fat diet, low-fibre/high-fibre diet, food additives, pre- probiotics) influence the mucus at different levels. Given that the mucus layer has been linked with the appearance of diseases, proper knowledge is highly warranted. Here, we debate different aspects of the mucus layer by focusing on its chemical composition, regulation of synthesis and degradation by the microbiota as well as some characteristics of the mucus layer in both physiological and pathological situations.","output":"Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus has given rise to concerns how diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are affected.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOV-2019) has created mass panic in China due to its highly contagious by contact and aerosols and lack of effective treatment. However, the emotion status of migraineurs stayed unclear during the nCOV-2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE To understand psychological distress of migraineurs by comparing with common population and identify potential high-risk factors of severe psychological distress among migraine patients. METHOD We enrolled the migraineurs treated at the department of Neurology of West China Hospital and healthy controls with age- and sex-matched to migraineurs. Data on clinicodemographics and psychological distress in the month of February 2020 (during in the nCOV-2019 outbreak in China) were collected. We used the Kessler 6-item (K-6) scale to assess psychological distress. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The 144 migraineurs and 150 controls were included in the study. Migraineurs showed significantly higher K-6 scores than controls (P < 0.001). Migraine attack frequency in previous 30 days and time spent paying attention to outbreak showed significant in multivariate logistic regression with respective odds ratios of 2.225 (95%CI 1.361-3.628, P = 0.001) and 1.589 (95% 1.117-2.26, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION During public health outbreaks, healthcare professionals should focus not only on controlling and reducing migraine attack but also on mental health of migraineurs, especially those with high frequency migraine attack.","output":"The status and high risk factors of severe psychological distress in migraine patients during nCOV-2019 outbreak in Southwest China: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sars-CoV-2 infection influences older individuals at the forefront, and there is still limited data on the COVID-19 vaccine response in the geriatric population. This study aimed to assess antibody response after vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine and examine possible factors affecting this response in a geriatric population. METHODS: individuals who have been on at least the 28th day after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine were included. Comprehensive geriatric assessment tools and the Clinical Frailty Scale were performed. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibodies were detected and, levels 1 U/ml were defined as seropositive, <1 U/ml were defined as seronegative. RESULTS: a total of 497 patients were included and divided into three groups according to the days past after the second dose of the vaccine (Group 1: 28C59 days, Group 2: 60C89 days and Group 3: 90 days and more). Groups included 188, 148 and 171 patients, respectively. Seropositivity rate in each group was 80.9,73.2 and 57.3%, respectively. In Groups 1 and 2, Charlson Comorbidity Index score was higher in the seronegative group (P = 0.023 and P = 0.011, respectively). In Group 3, the prevalence of frailty was significantly higher in the seronegative group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the antibody response after vaccination with Sars-CoV 2 inactivated vaccine in the Turkish geriatric population. Moreover, this is the first study revealing the relationship between antibody response and frailty.

This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission. Here, we develop viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and fit them to data to estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number. We then develop a model linking viral load (VL) to infectiousness and show a persons infectiousness increases sublinearly with VL and that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself. Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness, we further incorporated data on antigen and RT-PCR tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission. We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency; however, more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost but with many more false-negative tests. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies.","output":"In vivo kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its relationship with a persons infectiousness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for an array of extrapulmonary manifestations, including direct and indirect neurological complications Currently, all published cases noting pituitary apoplexy in patients with COVID-19 have discovered underlying pituitary macroadenomas Herein, we describe the first documented case, to our knowledge, of pituitary apoplexy attributed solely to COVID-19 in the absence of other identifiable causes While much remains to be discovered and understood regarding COVID-19, we discuss the potential pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated pituitary apoplexy and raise awareness of this clinical complication","output":"Pituitary Apoplexy Attributed to COVID-19 Infection in the Absence of an Underlying Macroadenoma or Other Identifiable Cause"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new mutation of 2019-nCoV emerged and has been spreading worldwide Dental practices are an important person-to-person transmission route In this regard, preventive measures are required to avoid the cross contamination among professionals and patients This report brings recommended measures for dental assistance during the pandemic phase The clinical protocol applied at the Department of Oral Maxillofacial and Surgery, such as at the Department of Radiology, Hospital University M&uuml;nster, is described A management protocol was applied to prevent the transmission route of 2019-nCoV Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are treated only in emergency situations The use of protective equipment and dental office isolation were the major points to avoid the contact between infected and non-infected patients Preventive measures should be taken in order to reduce the spread of 2019-nCoV infection","output":"2019-nCoV: Measures Adopted at the Departments of Oral Surgery and Radiology during the Period of an Uncontrolled Transmission Increase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report here a Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala state, India, which had caused fatal encephalitis in a 12-year-old boy and the outbreak response, which led to the successful containment of the disease and the related investigations.

In separate blocks of trials, the numerals were presented either in Mandarin or in Arabic number formats. In addition to the standard influence of numerical distance, a significant predictor of performance was the degree of physical similarity between the probe and the standard as depicted in Mandarin. Additionally, competing effects of physical similarity, defined in terms of the Arabic number format, were also found. Critically the size of these different effects of physical similarity varied systematically across individuals such that larger effects of one compensated for smaller effects of the other. It is argued that the data favor accounts of processing that assume that different number formats access different format-specific representations of quantities. Moreover, for Chinese participants the default is to translate numerals into a Mandarin format prior to accessing quantity information.

It is a journey in which the mentor aids the development of their clients by setting achievable goals and realistic plans, monitoring progress and providing feedback or assisting reflection. The mentor assists the learner in solving problems and providing personal support and motivation. As the relationship develops over time, the mentor will need to utilise various skills, knowledge and behaviours in order to facilitate successful outcomes. Effective mentoring relies on a process known as the 'mentor life cycle.' This involves the matching process, contracting, use of mentor models or diagnostic tools, appraisal, peer and group supervision. Methods A literature review was performed (keywords were 'coaching' or 'coach', 'mentoring' or 'mentor' and 'dentistry'). Guidance, institutional publications and original research were considered. Limits were applied (2013 onwards, English only). The evidence was appraised to inform a best practice guide for use in mentoring, applicable to dentistry. Conclusion Mentoring can create a positive culture that can help team members share knowledge, cultivate new ideas and improve team working. This paper explores the role of mentoring in a dental healthcare setting and the use of the 'mentor's toolkit' to promote professional development of the individuals involved. It also highlights the stages of the mentoring process, use of the GROW model and the role of supervision to support mentors in mutual growth and learning. When used effectively, the mentoring process positively impacts on both the organisation and the individuals within it, ultimately resulting in better patient care.","output":"GROWing in dentistry: mentoring the dental professional"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to COVID-19, Korea has implemented digital contact tracing and patient route disclosure schemes.

This study examines income-related health inequalities and their main contributors in China during the pandemic. METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media in China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China provided comprehensive data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the lockdown. Of them, 8448 subjects provided data for this analysis. Concentration Index (CI) and Corrected CI (CCI) were used to measure income-related inequalities in mental health and self-reported health (SRH), respectively. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was used to identify contributors to health inequalities. RESULTS: Most participants reported their health status as \\"very good\\" (39.0%) or \\"excellent\\" (42.3%). CCI of SRH and mental health were - 0.09 (p < 0.01) and 0.04 (p < 0.01), respectively, indicating pro-poor inequality in ill SRH and pro-rich inequality in ill mental health. Income was the leading contributor to inequalities in SRH and mental health, accounting for 62.7% (p < 0.01) and 39.0% (p < 0.05) of income-related inequalities, respectively. The COVID-19 related variables, including self-reported family-member COVID-19 infection, job loss, experiences of food and medication shortage, engagement in physical activity, and five different-level pandemic regions of residence, explained substantial inequalities in ill SRH and ill mental health, accounting for 29.7% (p < 0.01) and 20.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. Self-reported family member COVID-19 infection, experiencing food and medication shortage, and engagement in physical activity explain 9.4% (p < 0.01), 2.6% (the summed contributions of experiencing food shortage (0.9%) and medication shortage (1.7%), p < 0.01), and 17.6% (p < 0.01) inequality in SRH, respectively (8.9% (p < 0.01), 24.1% (p < 0.01), and 15.1% (p < 0.01) for mental health).

Patients were classified into the PAB1 (150C400 mg/L; N = 183) and PAB2 (< 150 mg/L; N = 225) groups. Data collection was performed using the hospitals electronic medical records system. The predictive value of PAB was evaluated by measuring the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Patients were defined as severely or critically ill based on the Guidance for COVID-19 (7th edition) by the National Health Commission of China. During this analysis, 316 patients had severe cases and 65 had critical cases. A reduced PAB level was associated with a higher risk of mortality and a longer hospital stay. The AUROC curve for the prognosis based on the PAB level was 0.93, with sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 77.6%. For severe cases, a lower level of PAB was associated with a higher risk of malnutrition, higher NK cell counts, and lower B lymphocyte counts; these factors were not significant in critical cases. C-reactive protein and nutritional status mediated the association between PAB and prognosis.

METHODS: The levels of total immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE), complement (C3, C4) results were retrospectively analyzed in COVID-19 patients. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to explore the risk factors associated with the in-hospital death. RESULT: A total of 236 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 169 were transferred to another institution or discharged (survival group) and 67 died in hospital (non-survival group). Compared with survivors, the levels of IgA and IgE in non-survivors increased significantly, and level of complement C3 decreased. Non-survivors also showed higher incidence of chest tightness, breath shortness and dyspnoea; higher levels of inflammatory indicators, leukocytes and neutrophils; and low levels of lymphocyte subsets. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (HR: 1.099; 95%CI: 1.057-1.143; p < 0.0001), d-dimer greater (HR: 1.294; 95%CI: 1.138-1.473; p < 0.0001) and decreased complement C3 level (HR: 0.073; 95%CI: 0.007-0.722; p = 0.025) on admission.

We find that the rates of mortgage forbearance in the COVID-19 period are similar to those in the natural disaster sample but are much higher than in the baseline sample. In all three periods, we find higher forbearance rates are associated with lower FICO scores, higher DTI ratios, and higher LTV ratios. In addition, higher levels of the cumulative cases of COVID-19 are associated with higher forbearance rates. We also examine the payment behavior of borrowers who entered forbearance during the COVID-19 crisis. We show that most mortgages in forbearance missed at least one payment within the first three months or were delinquent when entering forbearance. However, by the seventh month after entry into forbearance, about half of the mortgages are current, whereas about 40.7% are at least 90 days delinquent.

The symptoms with the highest prevalence were anosmia (43.1% (95% CI 35.2% to 51.3%), n=15 975, 63 studies), weakness (40.0% (95% CI 27.9% to 53.5%), n=221, 3 studies), fatigue (37.8% (95% CI 31.6% to 44.4%), n=21 101, 67 studies), dysgeusia (37.2% (95% CI 29.8% to 45.3%), n=13 686, 52 studies), myalgia (25.1% (95% CI 19.8% to 31.3%), n=66 268, 76 studies), depression (23.0% (95% CI 11.8% to 40.2%), n=43 128, 10 studies), headache (20.7% (95% CI 16.1% to 26.1%), n=64 613, 84 studies), anxiety (15.9% (5.6% to 37.7%), n=42 566, 9 studies) and altered mental status (8.2% (95% CI 4.4% to 14.8%), n=49 326, 19 studies). Heterogeneity for most clinical manifestations was high.Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 in the pandemic's early phase are varied and common. The neurological and psychiatric academic communities should develop systems to facilitate high-quality methodologies, including more rapid examination of the longitudinal course of neuropsychiatric complications of newly emerging diseases and their relationship to neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers.","output":"Neurology and neuropsychiatry of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the early literature reveals frequent CNS manifestations and key emerging narratives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fake news spreading, with the aim of manipulating individuals' perceptions of facts, is now recognized as a major problem in many democratic societies. Yet, to date, little has been understood about how fake news spreads on social networks, what the influence of the education level of individuals is, when fake news is effective in influencing public opinion, and what interventions might be successful in mitigating their effect. In this paper, starting from the recently introduced kinetic multi-agent model with competence by the first two authors, we propose to derive reduced-order models through the notion of social closure in the mean-field approximation that has its roots in the classical hydrodynamic closure of kinetic theory. This approach allows to obtain simplified models in which the competence and learning of the agents maintain their role in the dynamics and, at the same time, the structure of such models is more suitable to be interfaced with data-driven applications. Examples of different Twitter-based test cases are described and discussed.","output":"From agent-based models to the macroscopic description of fake-news spread: the role of competence in data-driven applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People of minority ethnic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19. Whether this relates to increased infection risk, more severe disease progression, or worse in-hospital survival is unknown. The contribution of comorbidities or socioeconomic deprivation to ethnic patterning of outcomes is also unclear. METHODS: We conducted a case-control and a cohort study in an inner city primary and secondary care setting to examine whether ethnic background affects the risk of hospital admission with severe COVID-19 and/or in-hospital mortality. Inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 872 cases) were compared with 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people residing in the same region. For the cohort study, we studied 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical variables. FINDINGS: The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63C3.71] and 2.97 [2.30C3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.24 [1.83C2.74] for Black, 2.70 [2.03C3.59] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (adjusted OR 1.01 [0.70C1.46]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4C16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 1.06 [0.82C1.37]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.72 [0.47C1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality but with a large confidence interval (adjusted HR 1.71 [1.15C2.56]). INTERPRETATION: Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease, but do not affect in-hospital mortality risk. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.

Few studies have focused on work-life changes in this population. The present study investigated work-life changes in a group of physicians during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A survey was distributed electronically to physicians affiliated with a U.S. medical school inquiring about experiences during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to September 2020). RESULTS In logistic regression models adjusted for age, significantly more female physician- parents reported increased burnout, increased time with kids, and increased fear of going to work compared to male physician-parents. Around 1 in 2 attendings reported burnout, regardless of parenting status. CONCLUSION While high rates of burnout were found across all groups in this study, differences were found by gender and parenting status.

In particular, it was examined whether the relationship between out-of-pocket health expenditure and poverty was contingent on a certain threshold level of out-of-pocket health spending. The dynamic panel threshold method, which allows for the endogeneity of the threshold regressor (out-of-pocket health expenditure), was used. Three indicators were adopted as poverty measures, namely the poverty headcount ratio, the poverty gap index, and the poverty gap squared index. At the same time, out-of-pocket health expenditure was measured as a percentage of total health expenditure. The results showed the validity of the estimated threshold models, indicating that only beyond the turning point, which was about 29 percent, that out-of-pocket health spending led to increased poverty. When heterogeneity was controlled for in the sample, using the World Bank income classification, the findings showed variations in the estimated threshold, with higher values for the low- and lower-middle-income groups, as compared to the high-income group. For the lower-income groups, below the threshold for out-of-pocket health expenditure, it had a positive or insignificant effect on poverty reduction, while it led to higher poverty above the threshold. Further, the sampled countries were divided into regions, according to the World Health Organization. Generally, improving health care systems through tolerable levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure is an inevitable step toward better health coverage and poverty reduction in many developing countries.","output":"Out-of-Pocket Health Expenditure and Poverty: Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Threshold Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 1,250,000 deaths worldwide. With limited therapeutic options, proning nonintubated patients emerged as a safe and affordable intervention to manage hypoxemia. METHODS: A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2C3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19Cspecific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients.

The aims of this scoping review are to (1) identify prescribing guidelines that are available for older adults with multimorbidity and (2) to identify cross-cutting themes used in these guidelines. DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library databases, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, grey literature sources, six key geriatrics journals, and reference lists of identified review papers. The search was conducted in November 2018 and updated in September 2019. STUDY SELECTION General prescribing guidelines tailored to or for adults including older adults with multimorbidity. DATA EXTRACTION Data for publication description, guideline characteristics, information for users and criteria were extracted. The synthesis contains summarised qualitative descriptions of the studies and guideline characteristics as well as identified cross-cutting themes. RESULTS Our search strategy yielded 10 427 unique citations, of which 70 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for synthesis. Among these, there were 61 unique guidelines and tools which used implicit, explicit, mixed or other approaches in the prescriber decision-making process. There are 11 cross-cutting themes identified in the guidelines. Prescriber-related themes are: conduct a comprehensive assessment before prescribing, identify patients' needs, goals and priorities, adopt shared decision-making, consider evidence-based recommendations, use clinical prescribing tools, incorporate multidisciplinary inputs and embrace technology-enabled prescribing. Wider organisation-related and system-related themes related to education, training and the work environment are also identified. CONCLUSIONS From guidelines and tools identified, eleven cross-cutting themes provide a usable knowledge base when seeking to optimise prescribing among older adults with multimorbidity.

METHODS A prospective survey design was used. Surveys were sent to all delegates (n=432) who attended the conference, and 294 delegates responded (68% response rate). The survey was developed to determine the level of concern about travelling to Toronto; the adequacy of screening measures; the level of stress about attending; and the occupational consequences of attending. RESULTS Fifty per cent of the participants were not concerned about travelling to Toronto, while the other 50% expressed some concern ranging from mild to serious. Concerns included being exposed to SARS and fear of transmitting it to others upon return. Reasons for attending the conference despite concern included a desire for continuing education, decrease in the number of reported SARS cases, and perceived minimal risk. Almost one-half (n=140) felt the screening measures at the conference were adequate, while 4% felt they were inadequate and 9% somewhat adequate. Delegates (n=99) suggested that temperature-taking (32.2%), improved screening vigilance (14.4%), SARS screening forms checked daily (9.1%), strictly controlled entry (8.1%) and adopting hospital screening procedures (7.1%) should have been instituted. CONCLUSION Health care professionals planning conferences in this era of new respiratory diseases can benefit from understanding the responses of delegates who attended conferences during outbreaks.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical performance of six different SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and their quantitative results to better elucidate the clinical role of serology testing in COVID-19. DESIGN: Six SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were tested using remnant specimens from 190 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for each assay with the current manufacturer's cutoff and a lower cutoff. A numeric result analysis and discrepancy analysis were performed Results: The specificity was >93% for all assays, and sensitivity was >80% for all assays (&#8805; 7 days post-polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing). Inpatients with more severe disease had higher numeric values compared to health care workers with mild or moderate disease.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic SEIHR (sSEIHR) model to describe such random fluctuations and provide sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of the disease-free equilibrium, based on the basic reproduction number that we estimated. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate strong threshold behavior near the estimated basic reproduction number, suggesting that the necessary conditions for stochastic stability are close to the sufficient conditions derived. Furthermore, we found that increasing the noise level slightly reduces the final proportion of infected individuals. In addition, we analyze COVID-19 data from various regions worldwide and demonstrate that by changing only a few parameter values, our sSEIHR model can accurately describe both the general trend and the random fluctuations in the number of daily new cases in each region, allowing governments and hospitals to make more accurate caseload predictions using fewer compartments and parameters than other comparable stochastic compartmental models.","output":"A stochastic SEIHR model for COVID-19 data fluctuations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Indian subcontinent witnessed first wave of COVID-19 around March 2020 and second wave in April 2021.

Furthermore, it was analysed in how far elements of current LDT regulation could qualify for an internationally harmonised concept ensuring quality, safety and performance of LDTs. METHODS: A review of regulatory literature including legislation as well as guidance documents was performed. The regulatory strategy was adapted from international guidance concepts used for commercially marketed IVD. It was then applied to the example of a large medical laboratory in the EU. A high-level comparison was conducted to identify gaps and matches between the different international regulatory requirements for LDTs. RESULTS: A four-step strategy for compliance of LDTs with the EU IVDR was implemented in an exemplary medical laboratory. On the basis of an internationally used LDT definition, LDTs constitute nearly 50% of the total IVD devices used in the laboratory. While an ISO 15189-compliant QMS is a major component, it should be accompanied by the application of appropriate processes for risk management, performance evaluation and continuous monitoring of LDTs. At least six criteria represent common characteristics of a potential, internationally convergent concept for the regulation/standardization of LDTs. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the impact of LDTs for individualized and innovative medical laboratory testing. Prerequisites for LDT use as especially given by the IVDR and missing interpretation in the EU with regard to the scope of LDT definition, the application of standards and the extent of documentation for LDTs currently lead to uncertainties for both laboratories and regulatory bodies responsible for LDT oversight. The characteristics identified as common criteria for ensuring quality, safety and performance of LDTs may be considered as central elements of future international consensus guidance.","output":"Laboratory-Developed Tests: Design of a Regulatory Strategy in Compliance with the International State-of-the-Art and the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (EU IVDR [In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation])"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Based on social exchange theory, the study examines the influence of informational and relational internal communication on cognitive and affective responses and job engagement during organizational crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among adults in China and its variation among provinces and by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Between May 8 and June 8, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults in China who were registered with the private survey company KuRunData. We set a target sample size of 10,000 adults, aiming to sample 300-360 adults from each province in China. Participants were asked 25 questions that tested their knowledge about COVID-19, including measures to prevent infection, common symptoms, and recommended care-seeking behavior. We disaggregated responses by age; sex; education; province; household income; rural-urban residency; and whether or not a participant had a family member, friend, or acquaintance who they know to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. All analyses used survey sampling weights. RESULTS: There were 5079 men and 4921 women who completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Out of 25 knowledge questions, participants answered a mean and median of 21.4 (95% CI 21.3-21.4) and 22 (IQR 20-23) questions correctly, respectively. A total of 83.4% (95% CI 82.7%-84.1%) of participants answered four-fifths or more of the questions correctly. For at least one of four ineffective prevention measures (using a hand dryer, regular nasal irrigation, gargling mouthwash, and taking antibiotics), 68.9% (95% CI 68.0%-69.8%) of participants answered that it was an effective method to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although knowledge overall was similar across provinces, the percent of participants who answered the question on recommended care-seeking behavior correctly varied from 47.0% (95% CI 41.4%-52.7%) in Tibet to 87.5% (95% CI 84.1%-91.0%) in Beijing. Within provinces, participants who were male, were middle-aged, were residing in urban areas, and had higher household income tended to answer a higher proportion of the knowledge questions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: This online study of individuals across China suggests that the majority of the population has good knowledge of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion still holds misconceptions or incorrect beliefs about prevention methods and recommended health care-seeking behaviors, especially in rural areas and some less wealthy provinces in Western China. This study can inform the development of tailored public health policies and promotion campaigns by identifying knowledge areas for which misconceptions are comparatively common and provinces that have relatively low knowledge.","output":"Knowledge About COVID-19 Among Adults in China: Cross-sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 g/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate.

At Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), one approach to reduce the scheduled screen time has been to pre-record lectures so students can access these at their convenience Much of the pharmacology content is delivered as lecture with some content reinforcement in small group sessions Transitioning from synchronous, live lectures to pre-recorded lectures that can be accessed asynchronously presents a number of potential challenges including building rapport with students, maintaining a common experience between the pharmacology faculty and students since the lectures can be recorded weeks or months before being accessible to the students, responding to non-verbal cues during the lecture to expand or quickly move past a concept, opportunities for faculty development in response to those non-verbal cues, and continuous quality improvement of the lecture based on real-time feedback One solution has been the ?interactive lecture?: a hybrid model in which students prepare for a synchronous session by watching a short (15-20 min) pre-recording that provides relevant physiology and potentially pharmacological strategies Students join the synchronous session to reinforce and build on concepts from the pre-recording Because they are coming into the session with some degree of foundational knowledge, there are more opportunities for interaction in the form of polling questions Similar to reading the non-verbal cues in the classroom, these questions allow the instructor to respond to the students in the room and adjust the teaching focus in real-time In this way, the session is somewhat directed by the students and their understanding and questions Additionally, the instructor can revise the session in the future based on a better understanding of what concepts were clear and where students struggled The IUSM second-year medical students had the experience of one course in which pharmacology was taught asynchronously with only one synchronous small group session and another course in which pharmacology was taught synchronously for all sessions either as interactive lectures or small group sessions At the end of the second course, students received an evaluation in which they were asked to rank their preference The overall response rate was 79% (296 of 375 students responding) Of these, 32% of students chose only the pre-recording and 13% of students chose to only access slides without any recording or live session The remaining 55% of students included a synchronous session in their preference Clearly, there is a large fraction of students who prefer to learn the pharmacology content independently Based on other feedback, many of these students are utilizing non-IUSM resources such as Sketchy Pharm, First Aid, and USMLE Step 1 Qbank as their primary resource for pharmacology content However, the majority of students want some form of synchronous session and interaction in order to help learn, solidify, and apply pharmacology Of those students, nearly half preferred the interactive lecture format The interactive lecture is an efficient and effective way to deliver pharmacology content and maintain student-faculty interaction in the virtual classroom","output":"Teaching Pharmacology to Medical Students: Preference for Faculty Interaction Over Recorded Lectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID 19 pandemic is taking its toll on humanity in more ways than readily discernable The number of recoveries inspires hope but it needs to be ensured that apart from physical recovery a holistic rehabilitation of the sufferer is contemplated","output":"The psycho social ramifications of the COVID 19  A personal treatise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the WHO, front-of-pack nutrition labeling provides simplified nutrition information in the form of symbols, colors or words that can help consumers understand the nutritional quality of food, thus leading them to healthier food choices.

From October 2003 to April 2004, nasopharyngeal samples from 211 children less than 1 year old were analyzed to detect respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the predominant virus isolated (96 children [45.5%]), followed by influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus type 1, which were only occasionally detected. From January 2004 to April 2004, a nested retrotranscription-PCR, using in-house primers directed to the matrix protein gene of hMPV, was carried out on samples in which no other viruses were detected. hMPV was detected in 18 (16.2%) children, indicating that this virus was the second-most-frequent cause of viral respiratory infections in children less than 1 year old. The rate of hospitalization for RSV- and hMPV-infected children was higher than 75%. While RSV had a peak from December to February, hMPV was increasingly detected from January to April. The mean age of hMPV-infected children (6.44 +/- 3.64 [mean +/- standard deviation] months) was significantly higher than that of RSV-infected children (3.99 +/- 2.96 [mean +/- standard deviation] months).

Here, we evaluated a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated enzyme 12a (CRISPR-Cas12a)-based method for detecting major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) in SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples. Methods: Allele-specific CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting the signature mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are designed. A total of 59 SARS-CoV-2 positive oropharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the performance of the CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated assay to identify major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Results: Compared with Sanger sequencing, the eight allele-specific crRNAs analyzed can specifically identify the corresponding mutations with a positive predictive value of 83.3-100% and a negative predictive value of 85.7-100%. Our CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated assay distinguished wild-type and four major VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) of SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 93.8-100.0% and a specificity of 100.0%. The two methods showed a concordance of 98.3% (58/59) with a  value of 0.956-1.000, while seven (11.9%) samples were found to be positive for extra mutations by the CRISPR-based assay. Furthermore, neither virus titers nor the sequences adjacent to the signature mutations were associated with the variation of fluorescence intensity detected or the false-positive reaction observed when testing clinical samples. In addition, there was no cross-reaction observed when detecting 33 SARS-CoV-2 negative clinical samples infected with common respiratory pathogens. Conclusions: The CRISPR-Cas12a-based genotyping assay is highly sensitive and specific when detecting both the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain and major VOCs. It is a simple and rapid assay that can monitor and track the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and the dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and can be easily implemented in resource-limited settings.","output":"Detection of Major SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in Clinical Samples via CRISPR-Cas12a-Mediated Mutation-Specific Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented pandemic of a new disease, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has unusual clinical and immunological presentations.

However, civilian studies have not demonstrated a clear survival advantage, and prior observational studies noted selection bias when analyzing cryoprecipitate use. Additionally, due to the logistics involved in cryoprecipitate administration, it is inconsistently implemented alongside standardized massive transfusion protocols. This study aims to evaluate the effects of early cryoprecipitate administration on inpatient mortality in the setting of massive transfusion for exsanguinating trauma and to use propensity score analysis to minimize selection bias. METHODS: The registry of an urban level 1 trauma center was queried for adult patients who received at least 6 units of packed red blood cells within 4 h of presentation. Univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression, and propensity score matching were performed. RESULTS: 562 patients were identified. Patients with lower median RTS (6.86 (IQR 4.09-7.84) vs 7.6 (IQR 5.97-7.84), P<0.01), decreased Glasgow coma scale (12 (IQR 4-15) vs 15 (IQR 10-15), P<0.01), and increased lactate (7.5 (IQR 4.3-10.2) vs 4.9 (IQR 3.1-7.2), P<0.01) were more commonly administered cryoprecipitate. Mortality was greater among those who received cryoprecipitate (40.2% vs 23.7%, p<0.01) on univariate analysis. Neither multiple logistic regression (OR 0.917; 95% confidence interval 0.462-1.822; p = 0.805) nor propensity score matching (average treatment effect on the treated 2.3%, p = 0.77) revealed that cryoprecipitate administration was associated with a difference in inpatient mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving cryoprecipitate within 4 h of presentation were more severely injured at presentation and had increased inpatient mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score analysis failed to show that early administration of cryoprecipitate was associated with survival benefit for exsanguinating trauma patients.

The study is designed to assess PZP Progression-Free Survival (PFS) (under treatment), Overall Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by investigators, tolerability and subsequent post-pazopanib therapy sequences. Impact of COVID-19 on patient's care was also assessed. Eligible patients were recruited from Nov 2017 to Jan 2019 in 55 participant sites in France. This interim analysis presents results 30 months (mo) after last patient was enrolled in the study. Results: The 217 patients were 71.1% males, with a median age of 69.6 years and had mRCC with a favourable (27.1%), intermediate (52.1%) or poor (20.8%) IMDC risk score according to physician. ECOG-PS was 0, 1 and 2 in respectively 43.3%, 39% and 17.6% of patients. Metastases were mainly located in lungs (64.1%), bones (28.6%), mediastinal (18%)/abdominal (17.1%). Patients had an history of partial/total nephrectomy in 54.8% of cases and previous local treatments for metastases in 27.6%. Median PFS, assessed by investigator, was 10.5 mo (95%CI: 9-12.4), similarly in patients < 65-year-old (YO) with 11.3 mo (95%CI: 7-16.3) and in those  65 YO with 9.9 mo (95%CI: 8.9-12). When assessed according to the IMDC risk score, mPFS was 18.1 mo (95%CI: 9.9-23.3) in favourable, 11.5 mo (95%CI: 8.7-14.4) in intermediate and 6.2 mo (95%CI: 3.5-9.5) in poor mRCC. The median OS was 27.3 mo (95%CI: 24.3 - ND). Investigator-assessed ORR was 48.3% with a CR in 6 patients (3.5%) and a PR in 77 (44.8%). After a median treatment duration of 10.1 mo, 190 patients (87.6%) discontinued PZP and 67.9% received at least one post-PZP line. Second line post-PZP consisted in nivolumab (71.3%), cabozantinib (14.7%), sunitinib (7%) or other (7%). Adverse Event (AE) leading to PZP dose reduction and discontinuation were reported in 42% and 40.9% of patients and treatment-related serious AE in 22.2% of patients. No safety signal was newly identified. The impact of the Covid 19 pandemic was limited on patients' cares and study follow-up. Visits during the pandemic included 84.1% of tumour evaluation. For 29 patients (14.1%), follow-up visits were carried out as a teleconsultation. Few patients (5,7%) had no visits during the pandemic.

Methods: Agent-based modelling Results: The likelihood of the presence of an outbreak in a care home is associated with the care home population size. Cohorting of residents and staff into smaller, self-contained units reduces the spread of COVID-19. Restricting the number of visitors to the care home to shield its residents does not significantly impact the cumulative number of infected residents and risk of outbreak occurrence in most scenarios. Only when the community prevalence where staff live is considerably lower than the prevalence where visitors live (the former prevalence is less than or equal to 30% of the latter), relaxing visitation increases predicted infections much more significantly than it does in other scenarios. Maintaining a low infection probability per resident-visitor contact helps reduce the effect of allowing more visitors into care homes. Conclusions: Our model predictions suggest that cohorting is effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in care homes. However, according to predictions shielding residents in care homes is not as effective as predicted in a number of studies that have modelled shielding of vulnerable population in the wider communities.","output":"IMPACT OF VISITATION AND COHORTING POLICIES TO SHIELD RESIDENTS FROM COVID-19 SPREAD IN CARE HOMES: AN AGENT-BASED MODEL: Controlling COVID-19 in care homes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike the large body of research on investigating interactions among cities using survey data, the social media-based city interaction study has received much less exploration Based on geographical studies of social media content in China, we develop a few indices quantifying various levels of geographical awareness among cities (1) We find that the geographical awareness proxy by the social media-based indices can measure interactions among cities Specifically, the geographical awareness among cities follows gravitational law and is highly correlated with mobility flows (2) The spatial in-awareness index (SIAI) is an appropriate index indicating a city's ranking in the urban hierarchy (3) the spatial out-awareness rate (SOAR) can indicate the interactions from a focal city to other cities Our findings also show that SOAR can predict the number of people infected during a pandemic in a city system Once the origin city or hotspots of the outbreak and the number of infected persons within those cities are known, we can use the social media-based SOAR index to predict number of cases for other else cities in the urban system With this information, governments can properly and efficiently deliver medical equipment and staff to cities where large populations are infected ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Measuring interaction among cities in China: A geographical awareness approach with social media data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Utilizing an ionic liquid strategy, we report crystal structures of salts of free anionic nucleobases and base pairs previously studied only computationally and in the gas phase.

METHODS Brain death was induced by slow intracranial blood infusion in anesthetized pigs after randomization to placebo (n = 11) or to methylprednisolone (n = 8) to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), wedged PAP (PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and effective pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) were measured 1 and 5 hours after Cushing reflex. Lung tissue was sampled to determine gene expressions of cytokines and oxidative stress molecules, and pathologically score lung injury. RESULTS Intracranial hypertension caused a transient increase in blood pressure followed, after brain death was diagnosed, by persistent increases in PAP, PCP and the venous component of PVR, while PAWP did not change. Arterial PO2/fraction of inspired O2 (PaO2/FiO2) decreased. Brain death was associated with an accumulation of neutrophils and an increased apoptotic rate in lung tissue together with increased pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6/IL-10 ratio and increased heme oxygenase(HO)-1 and hypoxia inducible factor(HIF)-1 alpha expression. Blood expressions of IL-6 and IL-1 were also increased. Methylprednisolone pre-treatment was associated with a blunting of increased PCP and PVR venous component, which returned to baseline 5 hours after BD, and partially corrected lung tissue biological perturbations. PaO2/FiO2 was inversely correlated to PCP and lung injury score. CONCLUSIONS Brain death-induced lung injury may be best explained by an initial excessive increase in pulmonary capillary pressure with increased pulmonary venous resistance, and was associated with lung activation of inflammatory apoptotic processes which were partially prevented by methylprednisolone.","output":"Mechanical versus humoral determinants of brain death-induced lung injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A typical epidemic often involves the transmission of a disease, the flow of information regarding the disease, and the spread of human preventive behaviors against the disease.

In the practice of plague treatment for thousands of years, Daoist medicine has developed a special etiology of plague that includes Qi-based theories (Qi is considered to be the force that informs and animates all things in Daoism, thus, plague is also considered to be caused by specific and hazardous Qi.) and worm-based theories, forming a strategy of plague control that includes prevention before an epidemic, active treatment during the epidemic, and recovery after the epidemic;these developed plague prevention methods combine isolation, disinfection, and drug use. Additionally, it is the first to practice a primitive immunoprophylaxis method that uses tissues and secretions of infected persons and animals to infect healthy individuals to gain disease immunity. It has formed a plague treatment method mainly based on drug treatment and ritual treatment, supplemented by acupuncture and physical treatment. It has left behind many effective drugs and prescriptions for plague treatment, some of which have a wide clinical application.

Daily exposure to confirmed or suspect COVID-19 cases increased the odds of high IES for non-SARS HCWs only. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, while 28% of HCWs in our study suffered from significant trauma-related psychological symptoms regardless of prior experience with the SARS epidemic, those with prior experience reported feeling safer and better equipped, finding the workload easier to manage, as well as having more confidence in their healthcare leaders. We recommend for more trauma-informed support strategies for our HCWs especially those from racial minority groups, who are foreign-born and isolated from their families.","output":"Psychological impact of repeated epidemic exposure on healthcare workers: findings from an online survey of a healthcare workforce exposed to both SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Characterization of COVID-19 in the Latinx community is necessary for guiding public health initiatives, health system policy, clinical management practices, and improving outcomes. Our aim was to describe the socioeconomic background and clinical profile of patients with COVID-19 at a large public hospital in Los Angeles to improve health disparities leading to poor outcomes during the pandemic.Design, Setting and Participants: A single center retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to Los Angeles County (LAC)+University of Southern California (USC) Medical Center between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020.Methods: We describe patient characteristics, socioeconomic factors, laboratory findings, and outcomes of the first 278 patients to present to LAC+USC Medical Center with COVID-19.Results: Patients self-identified as Hispanic (82.4%) or non-Hispanic (17.6%). Hispanic patients presented later from symptom onset (6 days vs 3 days, P = 0.027) and had higher post-intubation mortality (40.9% vs. 33.3%, P = 1), intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (31.1% vs. 22.2%, P = 0.87), and overall mortality (11.1% vs 10.2%, P = 1). However, the difference in admission rates, mechanical ventilation rates, and overall mortality rates were not statistically significant. A majority of patients, 275/278 (98.9%), reported residency ZIP codes in areas of higher population density, higher percentage of Latinx, born outside the United States, lower median income, and lower high school graduation rate when compared to the rest of Los Angeles County. Regression analysis within the Hispanic cohort found that age, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were predictors of mechanical ventilation and mortality.Conclusion: We show the Latinx community has been disproportionally affected by the pandemic in Los Angeles and we identified multiple socioeconomic and clinical characteristics that predispose this population to COVID-19 infection.

Thus, our meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this matter. METHODS: We compared the predetermined variables in this meta-analysis during the early and late pandemic. Using a combination of adapted search terms to fit the requirements of several search engines (PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost), we reviewed all observational studies citing our outcomes of interest before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: Thirty-five records comprising a total of 62,247 participants were identified. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that there was a huge reduction of nearly 80% for STEMI admission during the outbreak (n = 10,263) in contrast to before the outbreak period (n = 51,984). STEMI patients who were admitted during the outbreak received less primary PCI and had longer symptom-to-FMC (first medical contact) time along with prolonged door-to-balloon (DTB) time. A decrease in the achievement of final TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) 3 flow after primary PCI was also observed in this study. However, the number of in-hospital mortality was similar between two groups. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the STEMI care performance and worsening of clinical outcomes in STEMI patients, especially in the early pandemic period. Overall, concise health services must be implemented following a responsibility to obey health protocols to deliver high-quality services related to STEMI systems of care amidst the global pandemic.","output":"Investigating the implications of COVID-19 outbreak on systems of care and outcomes of STEMI patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is typically referred to as the measurement of the concentration of drugs in patient blood. Although in the past, TDM was restricted to drugs with a narrow therapeutic range in order to avoid drug toxicity, TDM has recently become a major tool for precision medicine being applied to many more drugs. Through compensating for interindividual differences in a drug's pharmacokinetics, improved dosing of individual patients based on TDM ensures maximum drug effectiveness while minimizing side effects. This is especially relevant for individuals that present a particularly high intervariability in pharmacokinetics, such as newborns, or for critically/severely ill patients. In this article, we will review the applications for and limitations of TDM, discuss for which patients TDM is most beneficial and why, examine which techniques are being used for TDM, and demonstrate how mass spectrometry is increasingly becoming a reliable and convenient alternative for the TDM of different classes of drugs.

The expression of heparanase in the tumor microenvironment is positively correlated with the aggressiveness of the tumor and is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we have demonstrated that a new triazoleCthiadiazole-bearing small molecule showed good heparanase inhibition along with attenuation of tumor growth and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a marked decrease in primary tumor growth in mice treated with a small molecule that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. Given these encouraging results, studies are underway to better elucidate the mode of action and clinical significance of triazoloCthiadiazoles. ABSTRACT: Compelling evidence ties heparanase, an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side (HS) chains of proteoglycans, with all steps of tumor development, including tumor initiation, angiogenesis, growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Moreover, heparanase levels correlate with shorter postoperative survival of cancer patients, encouraging the development of heparanase inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. Heparanase-inhibiting heparin/heparan sulfate-mimicking compounds and neutralizing antibodies are highly effective in animal models of cancer progression, yet none of the compounds reached the stage of approval for clinical use. The present study focused on newly synthesized triazoloCthiadiazoles, of which compound 4-iodo-2-(3-(p-tolyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-6-yl)phenol (4-MMI) was identified as a potent inhibitor of heparanase enzymatic activity, cell invasion, experimental metastasis, and tumor growth in mouse models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a marked decrease in primary tumor growth in mice treated with small molecules that inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity. This result encourages the optimization of 4-MMI for preclinical and clinical studies primarily in cancer but also other indications (i.e., colitis, pancreatitis, diabetic nephropathy, tissue fibrosis) involving heparanase, including viral infection and COVID-19.","output":"New Heparanase-Inhibiting Triazolo-Thiadiazoles Attenuate Primary Tumor Growth and Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (RoBat-CoV GCCDC1) is a cross-family recombinant coronavirus that has previously only been reported in wild-caught bats in Ynnan, China.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Anonymous online survey of adult Australian residents, 3 April - 2 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported psychological status during the preceding fortnight assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; symptoms of depression) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Optimism about the future was assessed with a 10-point study-specific visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 13 829 respondents contributed complete response data. The estimated prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 10) was 27.6% (95% CI, 26.1-29.1%) and of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 10) 21.0% (95% CI, 19.6-22.4%); 14.6% of respondents (95% CI, 13.5-16.0%) reported thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm (PHQ-9, item 9) on at least some days and 59.2% (95% CI, 57.6-60.7%) that they were more irritable (GAD-7, item 6).

BACKGROUND Although commonly referenced, the concept of the ideal prosthetic has never been fully realized. With the development of newer prosthetics and approaches to the ventral hernia repair, many surgeons do not fully understand the properties of the available prosthetics or the circumstances that warrant the use of a specific mesh. METHODS A systematic review of published literature from 1951 to June of 2009 was conducted to identify articles relating to ventral hernia repairs and the use of prosthetics in herniorrhaphy. RESULTS Important differences exist between the synthetics, composites, and biologic prosthetics used for ventral hernia repair in terms of mechanics, cost, and the ideal situation in which each should be used. CONCLUSIONS The use of synthetic mesh remains an appropriate solution for most ventral hernia repairs. Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has created a niche for both expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and composite mesh, as they are suited to intraperitoneal placement. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the newer biologic prosthetics are reasonable options for hernia repair in contaminated fields and for large abdominal wall defects; however, more studies need to be done before advocating the use of these biologics in other settings.","output":"A review of available prosthetics for ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mass vaccination campaigns have been used effectively to limit the impact of communicable disease on public health.

County-level data were obtained from several publicly available databases that were merged for analysis. FINDINGS: After adjustment for county-level characteristics, US counties with  80% of their residents  12 years of age fully vaccinated against COVID-19 had 30% (95% CI: 25?35; P < .001) and 46% (38?52; P < .001) lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, versus those with <50% coverage (reference group).

Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect PV interneurons in 1 male and 1 female pup from each litter at postnatal day 70. RESULTS: Significant between-group and subregion-specific effects were found in the dorsal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subfield and the ventral dentate gyrus (DG). In the dorsal CA1 subfield, there was an increase in the number of PV interneurons in both the EtOH and EtOH +THC groups, but a decrease with THC alone. There were fewer changes in interneuron numbers overall in the DG, though there was a sex difference, with a decrease in the number of PV interneurons in the THC-exposed group in males. There was also a greater cell layer volume in the DG in the EtOH +THC group than the control group, and in the CA1 region in the EtOH group compared to the control and THC groups.

BACKGROUND: The Eden Unit at the Royal Cornhill Hospital (RCH) in Aberdeen is a ten-bed specialist centre for the inpatient treatment of eating disorders (ED). Strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have meant that important aspects of therapy in the Eden Unit are no longer permissible. It is not known whether handicaps to providing the previous service are reflected in recent outcomes. METHOD: Values for age, length of stay (LOS), BMI, HbA1c (diabetic patients) and responses to three questionnaires: Eating Disorder Evaluation Questionnaire (EDE-Q); Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21; and Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE). This data were collected for April 2020 to February 2021 (Pandemic) and compared with five preceding years, April 2015 to March 2020 (Pre-COVID). The project was registered with NHS Grampian Quality Assurance Team and approved by the MCN Quality Assurance subgroup. Ethical approval was not required. A data collection sheet allowed anonymised data to be entered into a Microsoft Excel TM Spreadsheet for analysis of baseline demographics. RESULT: Average age of patients remained similar across the six years. Length of stay in the first year of the pandemic was significantly shortened. BMI on discharge in 2020/21 remained similar to preceding years. If relevant, HbA1c was measured throughout admission and comparison with BMI change reflected a focus on treating both diabetes and ED concurrently. Comparison of admission and discharge questionnaires to determine outcome measures proved difficult due to the small number of responses to both. CONCLUSION: Shorter LOS during the pandemic was a significant finding. Despite this, BMI on discharge remained similar, suggesting a shift to weight restoration due to lack of opportunities for an holistic approach due to restrictions. Key elements of treatment include careful monitoring of HbA1c and concurrent management of Type I Diabetes for those patients. The low response rate to questionnaires raises concern regarding their use, in their current format, as effective tools to measure outcomes. Though low numbers of questionnaire responses prevent firm conclusion, it appears that the reduced opportunities for elements of treatment to be undertaken in the community may have contributed to increased anxiety levels on discharge.","output":"An analysis of outcome measures in a specialist inpatient eating disorders unit in Aberdeen: changes since 2015 and response to the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through multiple transmission routes and understanding the mode of transmission is very important for its containment and prevention.

Results: Pilot data revealed that exposure of hNECs to 22 g/cm2 of diesel exhaust particles for 2h decreased mRNA expression of genes related to antiviral responses, such as IRF1 and IRF3, DDX58, and CXCL10, but increased IL6 expression. However, hNEC exposure to diesel exhaust also decreased mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two genes which provide crucial machinery for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. Conclusions: Based on these pilot data we hypothesize that exposure to particulate air pollution from diesel exhaust and woodsmoke will increase viral load and severity of infection in hNECs infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing analysis of viral replication, antiviral and inflammatory gene expression will further elucidate potential effects of different particulate air pollutants on SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Effects of Particulate Matter on SARS-CoV-2 Induced Antiviral Responses in Human Nasal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since January 2020, studies report reductions in air pollution among several countries due to social isolation measures, which have been adopted in order to contain the coronavirus outbreak progress (COVID-19) This study aims to evaluate the change in the atmospheric pollution levels by NO and NO(2) in S?o Paulo City for the social isolation period The NO and NO(2) hourly concentrations were obtained through air quality monitoring stations from CETESB, from January 14, 2020 to April 12, 2020 Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests were performed in the air pollutant time series We observed an overall negative trend in all stations, indicating a decreasing temporal pattern in concentrations Regarding NO, the highest absolute decrease rates were observed in the Congonhas (- 6 39 g m(-3) month(-1)) and Marginal Tiet (- 6 19 g m(-3) month(-1)) stations;regarding NO(2), the highest rates were observed in the Marginal Tiet (- 4 45 g m(-3) month(-1)) and Cerqueira Csar (- 4 34 g m(-3) month(-1)) stations In addition, we identified a turning point in the NO and NO(2) series trends that occurred close to the start date of the social isolation period (March 20, 2020) Moreover, from statistical analysis, it was found that NO(2) is a suitable surrogate for monitoring economic activities during social isolation periods Thus, we concluded that social isolation measures implemented on March 20, 2020 caused significant changes in the air pollutant concentrations in the city of S?o Paulo (as high as - 200% in NO(2) levels)","output":"S?o Paulo's atmospheric pollution reduction and its social isolation effect, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a very heterogeneous disease.

Some threats can be identified prospectively, others are only uncovered once the system goes live. Simulation and healthcare failure mode and effects analysis (HFMEA) can be used together to prospectively test a system without endangering patients. Objective We combined iterative simulations and HFMEA methodologies to conduct Simulation-based clinical systems testing (SbCST) to detect and mitigate latent safety threats (LSTs) prior to opening a hospital helipad. Methods This study was conducted in three phases. In Phase I, an interprofessional team created a process map and conducted a tabletop exercise, identifying LSTs that could theoretically occur during patient transfer from the new helipad. Using HFMEA methodology, steps predicted to be impacted by the new helipad were probed. Identified LSTs were assigned a hazard score. Mitigation solutions were proposed. Results from Phase I were used to plan Phase II, which used low fidelity simulation to test communication processes and travel paths. High fidelity simulation was used in Phase III to test previously identified LSTs. Results Over three testing phases, 31 LSTs were identified: 15 in Phase I, 7 in Phase II, and 9 in Phase III. LSTs fell under the categories of care coordination, facilities, equipment and devices. Eighteen (58%) were designated critical (hazard score 8). Conclusion A three-phase SbCST program using HFMEA methodology was an effective tool to identify LSTs.

Therefore, any endoscopic ablation technique is an overtreatment. Patients with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia confirmed by a specialized GI pathologist seem to have a significant risk for developing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or cancer. Therefore, endoscopic treatment in this case seems to be justified. However, up to now there has been no prospective study supporting this. In recent years, endoscopic treatment of HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer has become a widely accepted treatment approach and even the therapy of choice in many countries. Endoscopic resection (ER) is the best validated treatment method in patients with HGIN and mucosal Barrett's cancer, and is widely used all over the world. In contrast to ablative treatment methods like argon plasma coagulation and radiofrequency ablation, ER allows histological assessment of the resected specimen in order to assess the depth of infiltration of the tumor. However, ER of the neoplastic lesions should always be followed by ablation of the nondysplastic remaining Barrett's esophagus in order to reduce the risk of recurrence or metachronous neoplasia. The long-time complete remission rate with this two-step strategy is 95%. A matter of continuing debate is whether patients with Barrett's cancer infiltrating the upper third of the mucosal layer (pT1sm1) can be treated by ER. Data from our and other centers indicate that a subgroup of patients with pT1sm1 adenocarcinomas without the presence of risk factors (poor differentiation grade, lymph or blood vessel infiltration, size >20 mm, ulcerated lesion) have a very low risk for lymph node metastasis (<2%) and endoscopic therapy can be an alternative to radical surgery.","output":"Nonneoplastic and neoplastic Barrett's esophagus: the European perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health issue.

This work aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the range from 16.8 C to 27.4 C. Each 1 C rise of temperature was associated with a -4.8951% (t = -2.29, p = 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8 C to 27.4 C.

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro. Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included. Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I 2 = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I 2 = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia. Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.","output":"Efficacy and safety of current therapeutic options for COVID-19 - lessons to be learnt from SARS and MERS epidemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) said the situation in India was a \\"devastating reminder\\" of what the coronavirus could do.

[Peter Chew, 2021] shows that most people do not take the covid-19 vaccine because they question the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to create a simple formula for calculate the efficiency of the covid-19 vaccine. The purpose of creating this calculation formula is to allow the public to calculate the efficiency of the covid-19 vaccine by themselves, so that they can understand the effectiveness of the vaccine and decide to take the vaccine. This helps to get a high response to COVID vaccinationMethods: Use the Data publish at The New England JOURNAL of MEDICINE, Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine [Fernando P.

In addition, By using public news information, the public can use the Peter Chew formula to easily calculate Covid-19 vaccine efficacy. This is to ensure public can do the calculation themselves. A calculation of relative risk is also provided to provide more information to persuade the public to take the vaccine. Results: The efficiency of Pfizer BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for Malaysian medical worker calculated by using the Peter Chew formula is 95.0599 %. In addition, the calculation of Peter Chew's formula also shows that before the vaccination, about 12 medical staff were infected every day, but after the full vaccination, only about one medical worker was infected every two days. The calculation of relative risk can also make it easier for the public to know that people who are not vaccinated with Pfizer BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine are 22 times more likely to be infected than people who are fully vaccinated. The above results can convince those who easily question the effectiveness of vaccination. Conclusions: Peter Chew Formular easy to calculate, and the data required for the Peter Chew Formular calculation easy to obtain from public news. This is to ensure that the public can calculate the efficacy of the vaccine by themselves. The information on the calculation can let public compare the average target group get infected every day before and after fully vaccination is also an advantage to let public know the effectiveness of vaccination.

We then isolated and differentiated primary trophoblasts from non-pathological human placentas at term, and exposed them to SARS-CoV-2 virions.

As a mechanism of defense, we hypothesized that trophoblasts at term do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS, the two main host membrane receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The quantification of these proteins in the placenta during pregnancy confirmed the absence of TMPRSS2 at the surface of the syncytium. Surprisingly, a transiently induced experimental expression of TMPRSS2 did not allow the entry or replication of the virus in differentiated trophoblasts.

Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types, where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens' cellular uptake.

The results are consistent with a model in which extracellular vimentin acts as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a binding affinity less than that of the spike protein with ACE2.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to evaluate lung function through a spirometry study in autochthonous Kichwas permanently living at low and high-altitude. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study of spirometry differences between genetically matched lowland Kichwas from Limoncocha (230 m) at Amazonian basin and high-altitude Kichwas from Oyacachi (3180 m) in Andean highlands. The sample size estimates permitted to recruited 118 patients (40 men and 78 women) from Limoncocha and 95 (39 men and 56 women) from Oyacachi. Chi-square method was used to analyze association or independence of categorical variables, while Student's t test was applied to comparison of means within quantitative variables. ANOVA, or in the case that the variables didn't meet the criteria of normality, Kruskal Wallis test were used to compare more than two groups. RESULTS The FVC and the FEV1 were significantly greater among highlanders than lowlanders (p value < 0.001), with a proportion difference of 15.2% for men and 8.5% for women. The FEV1/FVC was significantly higher among lowlanders than highlanders for men and women. A restrictive pattern was found in 12.9% of the participants.

Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of DMTs on the humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MS patients. METHODS: We obtained sera from 912 Sardinian MS patients and 63 healthy controls 30 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 response using anti-Spike (S) protein-based serology. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by anti-Nucleocapsid (N) serology. Patients were either untreated or undergoing treatment with a total of 13 different DMTs. Differences between treatment groups comprised of at least 10 patients were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects model. Demographic and clinical data and smoking status were analyzed as additional factors potentially influencing humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: MS patients treated with natalizumab, teriflunomide, azathioprine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and rituximab showed significantly lower humoral responses compared to untreated patients. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in response between patients treated with the other drugs (dimethyl fumarate, interferon, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate) and untreated patients. In addition, older age, male sex and active smoking were significantly associated with lower antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. MS patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher humoral responses to vaccine than uninfected patients. CONCLUSION: Humoral response to BNT162b2 is significantly influenced by the specific DMTs followed by patients, as well as by other factors such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, and smoking status. These results are important to inform targeted strategies to prevent clinically relevant COVID-19 in MS patients.","output":"Effect of Different Disease-Modifying Therapies on Humoral Response to BNT162b2 Vaccine in Sardinian Multiple Sclerosis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes to wellbeing in a community-based sample of 638 adults with non-malignant chronic pain were assessed during a period of mandated lockdown measures in the UK to control the COVID-19 outbreak.

It may be the most widely used vaccine in human history and is the only licensed human tuberculosis (TB) vaccine available. Despite its excellent safety history, a century of use in global vaccination programs, and its significant contribution to reducing TB mortality among children, the efficacy of BCG continues to be disputed due to its incomplete protection against pulmonary TB in adults. Still vaccines offer the best chance to contain the ongoing spread of multi-drug resistance TB and disease dissemination. The development of improved vaccines against TB therefore remains a high global priority. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that genetically modified BCG, or administration of existing BCG through alternate routes, or revaccination, offers improved protection, suggesting that BCG is well poised to make a comeback. Intravesical BCG is also the only approved microbial immunotherapy for any form of cancer, and is the first-line therapy for treatment-na?ve non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMBIC), which represents a majority of the new bladder cancer cases diagnosed. However, almost a third of patients with NMIBC are either BCG unresponsive or have tumor recurrence, leading to a higher risk of disease progression. With very few advances in intravesical therapy over the past two decades for early-stage disease, and a limited pipeline of therapeutics in Phase 3 or late Phase 2 development, there is a major unmet need for improved intravesical therapies for NMIBC. Indeed, genetically modified candidate BCG vaccines engineered to express molecules that confer stronger protection against pulmonary TB or induce potent anti-tumor immunity in NMIBC have shown promise in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. This review discusses the development of second generation, genetically modified BCG candidates as TB vaccines and as anti-tumor adjuvant therapy for NMIBC.","output":"Recombinant BCGs for tuberculosis and bladder cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid triaging, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on age and pre-existing medical conditions. In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables. RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1. However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage/screening.","output":"Triage assessment of cardiorespiratory risk status based on measurement of the anaerobic threshold, and estimation by patient-reported activity limitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are multiple media platforms and various resources available for information on COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines the sources of information for COVID-19 used by the Malaysian public and identifies those that are associated with building public confidence and positive perceptions toward the Malaysian government. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 4850 Malaysian residents was conducted. Participant demographics, media use, information sources, and attitudes surrounding COVID-19 were assessed. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to gauge the relationship between demographics, information sources, and attitudes toward COVID-19. RESULTS: Malaysians primarily used television and internet news portals to access information on COVID-19. The Malaysian Ministry of Health was the most preferred source of COVID-19 information. Respondents who referred to the Ministry of Health, television, and the Malaysian National Security Council for information were more likely to believe that the country could win the battle against COVID-19 and that the government was handling the health crisis well compared to those who referred to other information sources. Those who used the World Health Organization, friends, YouTube, family, and radio as sources of information were less likely to harbor confidence and positive belief toward combating COVID-19.

METHODS: From March 29th to April 15th of 2020, a total of 240 patients with respiratory distress underwent both a low-dose chest CT scan and RT-PCR tests. The performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed with reference to the RT-PCR result. Two board-certified radiologists (mean 24 years of experience chest CT), blinded for the RT-PCR result, reviewed all scans and decided positive or negative chest CT findings by consensus. RESULTS: Out of 240 patients, 60% (144/240) had positive RT-PCR results and 89% (213/240) had a positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 were 100% (95% CI: 97-100%, 144/240), 28% (95% CI: 19-38%, 27/240), 68% (95% CI: 65-70%) and 100%, respectively.

Differentiation between both is important for proper management. CASE SUMMARY: We present a 56-year-old man with sudden cardiac arrest and was diagnosed to have ARVC based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He developed gradually worsening shortness of breath over the next 1 year. CS was unmasked after a cardiac positron emission tomography (PET). Patient was treated with methotrexate. A repeat cardiac PET scan showed improvement. DISCUSSION: The distinction between ARVC and CS is challenging. Both these entities have a patchy involvement and can have similar presentations. ARVC has a predominant right heart involvement. It is diagnosed with the help of an MRI, which shows regional right ventricular wall motion abnormality. These findings can have an overlap with CS. It is important to note that, even though sarcoidosis is a pathologic diagnosis, cardiac biopsy is rarely done owing to its patchy involvement. Cardiac PET scan has a high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose this entity. Once diagnosis is made, patients should be treated with immunosuppressants and should be closely followed. Repeat imaging should be considered at intervals to monitor disease progression. This case highlights the importance of multimodality imaging and tissue diagnosis to unmask the diagnosis of CS, a treatable infiltrative disorder which shares features with a potentially untreatable ARVC.","output":"Cardiac sarcoidosis masquerading as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics, one of the main sources of antibiotic misuse or over use, is a global challenge with detrimental public health consequences including acceleration of the development of antimicrobial resistance, and is facilitated by various intrinsic and extrinsic drivers. The current review aimed to systematically summarise and synthesise the qualitative literature regarding drivers of non-prescribed sale of antibiotics among community drug retail outlets in low and middle income countries. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar) and reference lists of the relevant articles were searched. The Joanna Briggs Institutes Critical Appraisal Checklist for qualitative studies was used to assess the quality of included studies. The enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research statement was used to guide reporting of results. Data were coded using NVivo 12 software and analysed using both inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles underwent full text review and 12 of these met the inclusion criteria. Four main themes were identified in relation to facilitators of non-prescribed sale of antibiotics among community drug retail outlets: i) the business orientation of community drug retail outlets and tension between professionalism and commercialism; ii) customers demand pressure and expectation; iii); absence of or a lax enforcement of regulations; and iv) community drug retail outlet staffs lack of knowledge and poor attitudes about antibiotics use and scope of practice regarding provision. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified several potentially amendable reasons in relation to over the counter dispensing of antibiotics. To contain the rise of antibiotic misuse or over use by targeting the primary drivers, this review suggests the need for strict law enforcement or enacting new strong regulation to control antibiotic dispensing, continuous and overarching refresher training for community drug retail outlet staff about antibiotic stewardship, and holding public awareness campaigns regarding rational antibiotic use.

Given the incubation period, the time from illness onset to death, and the case fatality ratio, the date of death can be estimated from the date of infection. We apply this idea conversely to estimate infections from deaths. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable daily infections during the first wave were between 35 and 42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before the official data were available during the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions.

Owing to the different incidences in males and females, this study aims to analyze the features involved in the transmission of shigellosis among male (subscript m) and female (subscript f) individuals using a newly developed sex-based model. METHODS: The data of reported shigellosis cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. A sex-based SusceptibleCExposedCInfectious/AsymptomaticCRecovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset, and a sex-age-based SEIAR model was applied in 2010 to explore the sex- and age-specific transmissions. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 130 770 shigellosis cases (including 73 981 male and 56 789 female cases) were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model exhibited a significant fitting effect with the shigellosis data (P < 0.001). The median values of the shigellosis transmission were 2.3225  10(8) for SAR(mm) (secondary attack rate from male to male), 2.5729  10(8) for SAR(mf), 2.7630  10(-8) for SAR(fm), and 2.1061  10(-8) for SAR(ff). The top five mean values of the transmission relative rate in 2010 (where the subscript 1 was defined as male and age  5 years, 2 was male and age 6 to 59 years, 3 was male and age  60 years, 4 was female and age  5 years, 5 was female and age 6 to 59 years, and 6 was male and age  60 years) were 5.76  10(-8) for (61), 5.32  10(-8) for (31), 4.01  10(-8) for (34), 7.52  10(-9) for (62), and 6.04  10(-9) for (64).

Demographic, knowledge and attitudes toward added sugar, dietary intake, and anthropometric data (i.e., height, weight, and waist circumference) were collected during face-to-face interviews. RESULTS Approximately half of the students (n = 106; 55.8%) were aware of the health consequences of excessive intake of added sugar, but only 32.6% (n = 62) reported making an effort to reduce their added sugar intake. The data indicated that 8.42% of the students (n = 16) consumed carbonated soft drinks daily, 15.8% (n = 30) consumed fruit drinks daily, and 45.8% (n = 87) consumed sweets daily. Underweight students consumed higher quantities of added sugar (expressed as percent of total energy intake) compared with students in all other weight status groups. Results showed negative associations between percentage of added sugar intake and intakes of fiber, iron, zinc, vitamin D, body mass index, and waist circumference.

We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS: Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county.

Decedents tended to be older, male, Hispanic, foreign-born, and have lower educational attainment. MRR indicated elevated COVID-19 morality rates among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic groups compared with the White group, with Black and Hispanic groups having the highest MRR at 2.75 (95%CI:2.54-2.97) and 4.18 (95%CI: 3.99-4.37), respectively. Disparities were larger at younger ages. Similar results were observed with PMR, which remained in analyses stratified by education. Elevated PMR were observed in all ethnicity/nativity groups, especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals, relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals, were generally larger at younger ages, and persisted after stratifying by education. Conclusions: Differential COVID-19 mortality was observed in California across racial/ethnic groups and by ethnicity/nativity groups with evidence of greater disparities among younger age groups. Identifying COVID-19 disparities is an initial step towards mitigating disease impacts in vulnerable communities.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality in California Based on Death Certificates: Disproportionate Impacts Across Racial/Ethnic Groups and Nativity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on the vegetable supply chain in China Effective evaluation of the pandemic's influences on vegetable production is vital for policy settings to enhance the security of vegetable supply Based on first-hand data from 526 households, we explored regional differences in different types of loss and potential factors affecting the severity farmer households suffered during the pandemic The results underline that sales contraction and price volatility in the context of interruption of supply chain dominate the total losses during the pandemic Such losses differ across provinces and are more substantial in provinces with stricter confinement measures Farmer households' participation in local market and modern marketing methods helps mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 shock, while labor hiring and facilities adoption in production widen the losses due to the shortage in the workforce In the future, the vegetable industry practitioners and relevant government departments should work together to coordinate the development of short and long supply chains and strengthen the stability and security of the vegetable supply chain","output":"Vegetable production under COVID-19 pandemic in China: An analysis based on the data of 526 households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many real-word evidence (RWE) studies that utilize existing healthcare data to evaluate treatment effects incur substantial, but avoidable bias from methodologically flawed study design; however, the extent of preventable methodological pitfalls in current RWE is unknown. To characterize the prevalence of avoidable methodological pitfalls with potential for bias in published claims-based studies of medication safety or effectiveness, we conducted an English-language search of PubMed for articles published from January 1, 2010 to May 20, 2019 and randomly selected 75 studies (10 case-control and 65 cohort studies) that evaluated safety or effectiveness of cardiovascular, diabetes, or osteoporosis medications using US health insurance claims. General and methodological study characteristics were extracted independently by two reviewers and potential for bias was assessed across 9 bias domains. Nearly all studies (95%) had at least one avoidable methodological issue known to incur bias and 81% had potentially at least one of the four issues considered major due to their potential to undermine study validity: time-related bias (57%), potential for depletion of outcome-susceptible individuals (44%), inappropriate adjustment for postbaseline variables (41%), or potential for reverse causation (39%). Median number of major issues per study was 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1 to 3) and was lower in cohort studies with a new-user, active-comparator design (median 1, IQR 0 to1) than in studies of prevalent users and a non-user comparator (median 3, IQR 3 to 4).

We did a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting at least one of 13 pathogens in children <5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea. We included 2011 rotavirus data from the Rotavirus Surveillance Network coordinated by WHO. We excluded studies conducted during diarrhea outbreaks that did not discriminate between inpatient and outpatient cases, reporting nosocomial infections, those conducted in special populations, not done with adequate methods, and rotavirus studies in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was used. Age-adjusted median proportions for each pathogen were calculated and applied to 712 000 deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years for 2011, assuming that those observed among children hospitalized for diarrhea represent those causing child diarrhea deaths. 163 articles and WHO studies done in 31 countries were selected representing 286 inpatient studies. Studies seeking only one pathogen found higher proportions for some pathogens than studies seeking multiple pathogens (e.g. 39% rotavirus in 180 single-pathogen studies vs. 20% in 24 studies with 5C13 pathogens, p<00001). The percentage of episodes for which no pathogen could be identified was estimated to be 34%; the total of all age-adjusted percentages for pathogens and no-pathogen cases was 138%.

The outbreak has disrupted the lives of people and is casting a heavy impact on the economies around the world by interrupting business operations and commercial activities. Whilst everyone is busy identifying various strategies from short term and medium to long term to overcome the recession, the future projects a blurry picture at least for the moment. A study group consisting of eminent persons recently submitted a report to the President containing recommendations aimed at steering Sri Lanka into a post-COVID-19 era of economic recovery. One of the recommendations was on Trade Agreements. The suggestion includes action to revive and accelerate the negotiation of a trade partnership agreement with China;an expanded agreement with India;an agreement with Thailand and with other Asian countries particularly other ASEAN members including Japan and to maximize the benefits from the Agreement already entered with Singapore.In this backdrop, the question arises as to whether the existing laws in Sri Lanka on Trade and Anti-Dumping are sufficient to protect the domestic traders and domestic industries against any possible unfair trading practices and the possibility of an unforeseen surge of imports which may arise with the signing of more Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements. An attempt is made in this article to examine the key features and the effectiveness of the provisions of the legislation passed by the Parliament in 2018 on Anti-Dumping and to identify the protective measures that are sought to be introduced under the same.The Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018, and the Safeguard Measures Act, No. 3 of 2018 were certified by the Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament in March 2018. The enactment of these two laws was to remedy a need to answer the grievances of domestic producers and manufacturers. The official statement issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the occasion stipulates that Sri Lanka has taken a fairly long time to introduce the relevant legislation. This article proceeds to consider some of the salient features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 (the Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 Act) namely: (1) Part I of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 on Anti-Dumping Duties, (2) the procedural steps in investigations under Part I on Anti-Dumping (3) Part II of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 Act on Countervailing Duties, and (4) the procedural steps in investigations under Part II on Countervailing Duties.The Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 contains significant noteworthy features. Firstly, the act attempts to strike a balance between competing interests. The Right to Information on one hand and the economic value of sensitive trade-related information on the other. Secondly, the Act specifies timeframes for inquiries and related procedural steps recognizing the importance of resolving trade-related disputes in an effective, efficient, and efficacious manner. Thirdly the Act lays down a systematic procedure that ensures a fair opportunity be given to all parties with provision for public interest intervention. In terms of methodology, this article strictly adopts a doctrinal approach;doctrinal since the article proceeds to engage in an analysis of the law as it is on the four areas identified above. The enactment of these two laws will significantly improve the countrys standing in global trade and Sri Lanka will join the league of World Trade Organization - WTO members who keenly look to offset possible adverse impacts on their domestic industries from trade liberalization processes. The Gazette Notification making the Anti Dumping Law operable was issued on the 09th of October 2020 and the law is in force from 10 Oct 2020. The order by the Minister under section 01 was published in the Gazzetta Extraordinary No. 2197/4 C dated 12th October 2020. Both the laws on paper appear to be comprehensive. Yet the levels of effectiveness can be evaluated only when the Ac stands the test of time. The reason/s for the delay in making the law operational is unclear. Section 84(1) of the Anti-Dumping Act authorizes the Minister to make regulations in respect of all matters required by the Act;the hold may be attributable to the formulation of the regulations. It may also be due to the setting up of infrastructure to facilitate the holding of inquiries, arming the officials with the necessary expertise for the successful implementation of the Act, or the contemplation of changes in policy and the introduction of further amendments to the already enacted laws. The effectiveness and/or whether the existing laws are sufficient to protect the domestic producers in the event of a surge of imports is debatable. The existing laws at the moment are not operational and the effectiveness is yet to stand the test of time. At the same time, the need to further consider strengthening the laws to protect domestic industries and producers whilst entering into more Trade Agreements cannot be undermined.","output":"The Call for Bilateral/Regional Trade Agreements and the Salient Features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 of Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has come up as most difficult problem as of today faced by whole world especially by the medical community All kinds of measures are being done by various governments and health officials to deal with this present pandemic Intensivists, physicians, and anesthetists have defined role in primary and ICU care Although the orthopedic community is not involved in first-line management of COVID-19-infected patients, we have equal responsibility to provide emergency care to all trauma patients and various other orthopedic emergencies While delivering services, it's essential to restrict the consumption of various resources It's our collective responsibility to prevent the spread of infection among healthcare workers and patients Lockdown implemented by various governments has impacted the global economy, which in turn resulted in reduction of purchasing power of patients, so we may have to choose more cost-effective implants and curtail the number of investigations While performing operations, certain procedures like using diathermy and saw blade generate aerosols So, it is our responsibility to understand these procedures and to make use of them only when absolutely essential We may experience second wave of cases later this year Relaxation of lockdown may not mean relaxation from the virus","output":"Dilemmas in corona crisis: responsibilities of orthopedic surgeons clearly defined?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThis study analyses how healthcare workers (HCWs) perceived risks, protection and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to medically approved risks and organisational measures. The aim is to explore blind spots of pandemic protection and make mental health needs of HCWs visible. MethodsWe have chosen an optimal-case scenario of a high-income country with a well-resourced hospital sector and low HCW infection rate at the organisational level to explore governance gaps in HCW protection. A German multi-method hospital study at Hannover Medical School served as empirical case; document analysis, expert information and survey data (n=1163) were collected as part of a clinical study into SARS-CoV-2 serology testing during the second wave of the pandemic (November 2020-February 2021). Selected survey items included perceptions of risks, protection and preventive measures. Descriptive statistical analysis and regression were undertaken for gender, profession and COVID-19 patient care. ResultsThe results reveal a low risk of 1% medically approved infections among participants, but a much higher mean personal risk estimate of 15%. The majority (68.4%) expressed some to very strong fear of acquiring infection at the workplace. Individual protective behaviour and compliance with protective workplace measures were estimated as very high. Yet only about half of the respondents felt strongly protected by the employer; 12% even perceived no or little protection. Gender and contact with COVID-19 patients had no significant effect on the estimations of infection risks and protective workplace behaviour, but nursing was correlated with higher levels of personal risk estimations and fear of infection. ConclusionsA strong mismatch between low medically approved risk and personal risk perceptions of HCWs brings stressors and threats into view, that may be preventable through better information and risk communication and through investment in mental health and inclusion in pandemic preparedness plans.","output":"Healthcare workers perceptions and medically approved COVID-19 infection risk: understanding the mental health dimension of the pandemic.

Concise, persuasive messaging is crucial, particularly given substantial levels of vaccine hesitancy in the UK. Our aim was to test which types of written information about COVID-19 vaccination, in addition to a statement of efficacy and safety, might increase vaccine acceptance. METHODS: For this single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we aimed to recruit 15 000 adults in the UK, who were quota sampled to be representative. Participants were randomly assigned equally across ten information conditions stratified by level of vaccine acceptance (willing, doubtful, or strongly hesitant). The control information condition comprised the safety and effectiveness statement taken from the UK National Health Service website; the remaining conditions addressed collective benefit, personal benefit, seriousness of the pandemic, and safety concerns. After online provision of vaccination information, participants completed the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (outcome measure; score range 7C35) and the Oxford Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale (mediation measure). The primary outcome was willingness to be vaccinated. Participants were analysed in the groups they were allocated. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN37254291. FINDINGS: From Jan 19 to Feb 5, 2021, 15 014 adults were recruited. Vaccine hesitancy had reduced from 269% the previous year to 169%, so recruitment was extended to Feb 18 to recruit 3841 additional vaccine-hesitant adults. 12 463 (661%) participants were classified as willing, 2932 (156%) as doubtful, and 3460 (184%) as strongly hesitant (ie, report that they will avoid being vaccinated for as long as possible or will never get vaccinated). Information conditions did not alter COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in those willing or doubtful (adjusted p values >070). In those strongly hesitant, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was reduced, in comparison to the control condition, by personal benefit information (mean difference C149, 95% CI C216 to C082; adjusted p=00015), directly addressing safety concerns about speed of development (?091, C158 to C023; adjusted p=00261), and a combination of all information (?086, C153 to C018; adjusted p=00313). In those strongly hesitant, provision of personal benefit information reduced hesitancy to a greater extent than provision of information on the collective benefit of not personally getting ill (?097, 95% CI C164 to C030; adjusted p=00165) or the collective benefit of not transmitting the virus (?101, C168 to C035; adjusted p=00150). Ethnicity and gender were found to moderate information condition outcomes. INTERPRETATION: In the approximately 10% of the population who are strongly hesitant about COVID-19 vaccines, provision of information on personal benefit reduces hesitancy to a greater extent than information on collective benefits. Where perception of risk from vaccines is most salient, decision making becomes centred on the personal. As such, messaging that stresses the counterbalancing personal benefits is likely to prove most effective. The messaging from this study could be used in public health communications. Going forwards, the study highlights the need for future health campaigns to engage with the public on the terrain that is most salient to them.

We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission) and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and death. MethodsFrom a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944 cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS- CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation. FindingsThe ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics - Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and 0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission. InterpretationML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more important in more severe cases.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for death. RESULTS: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000; n=3,964) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000; n=5,666) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 and 1,137 IPD cases during February-June 2020, including 40 IPD/COVID-19 (0.025% [95%sCI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections; 3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-27 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 &#8805;28 days after IPD. Case-fatality rates (CFR) were 63.2% (25/40), 47.6% (10/21) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively (p<0.001). In addition to an independent association with increasing age and pneumococcal serotype group, CFR was 7.8-fold (95% CI, 3.8-15.8) higher in those with IPD/COVID-19 co-infection and 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.4-10.7) higher in patients who developed COVID-19 3-27 days after IPD compared to patients with IPD only.

Introduction: The current new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a profound impact on medical practice. The objective was to analyse the ethical questions raised by the French ENT community during the first wave of Covid-19 infections. Methods: Four open-ended questions concerning ethical considerations in ENT were sent out in April 2020: (i) difficulties to care for covid-19 positive patients; (ii) impact of the health crisis on covid-19 negative patients; (iii) communication within the healthcare teams and with hospital staff; and (iv) management of information by the press, or national ENT societies. A thematic analysis was carried out and crossed with the epidemiological data of each respondent. Results: 31 responses from 13 different French Departments, including 21 from public institutions and 10 from private practice, median age of 45 and 17 men for 14 women, were analysed. The main ethical considerations concerned the management by ENTs of covid-19 positive patients, the modification of practices in consultation and in the operating room, the fear of loss of chance for covid-19 negative patients, the appropriate use of teleconsultations and teleworking and the consequences of fake-news for the population. Conclusion: In preparation of possible future pandemic outbreaks, key ethical aspects are to adapt patient management to local resources and infection prevalence, and circulate clear institutional guidelines.","output":"Questionnements thiques en ORL pendant la pandmie COVID-19 : Etude qualitative de tmoignages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microarray technology can be useful for pathogen detection as it allows simultaneous interrogation of the presence or absence of a large number of genetic signatures. However, most microarray assays are labour\\\\intensive and time\\\\consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)\\\\PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot\\\\and\\\\mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user\\\\friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes. The assay successfully detected viruses in clinical samples from the field, experimentally infected animals (as early as 1 day post\\\\infection (dpi) for FMDV and SVDV, 4 dpi for ASFV, 5 dpi for CSFV), as well as in biological material that were spiked with target viruses. The limit of detection was 10 copies/l for ASFV, PCV2 and PRRSV, 100 copies/l for SVDV, CSFV, VESV and 1,000 copies/l for FMDV. The electronic microarray component had reduced analytical sensitivity for several of the target viruses when compared with the multiplex RT\\\\PCR. The integration of capture probe printing allows custom onsite array printing as needed, while electrophoretically driven hybridization generates results faster than conventional microarrays that rely on passive hybridization. With further refinement, this novel, rapid, highly automated microarray technology has potential applications in multipathogen surveillance of livestock diseases.","output":"A multiplex reverse transcription PCR and automated electronic microarray assay for detection and differentiation of seven viruses affecting swine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research project addresses user-focused ranking in legal information retrieval (IR).

In our pursuit to establish a model for severe COVID-19, we inoculated young and adult male ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal inoculation established an infection in all ferrets, with viral dissemination into the brain and gut. Upon intratracheal inoculation only adult ferrets became infected. However, neither inoculation route induced observable COVID-19 symptoms. Despite this, a persistent inflammation in the nose was prominent in especially young ferrets and follicular hyperplasia in the bronchi developed 21 days post infection. These effects -if sustained- might resemble long-COVID. Respiratory and systemic cellular responses and antibody responses were induced only in animals with an established infection. We conclude that intranasally-infected ferrets resemble asymptomatic COVID-19 and possibly aspects of long-COVID.

Thus, we longitudinally investigated the dynamic changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and parallel changes in cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients with different disease severities to further address disease pathogenesis. METHODS: A total of 67 patients (10 moderate, 38 severe and 19 critical cases) with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Wuhan from February 8th to April 6th, 2020 were retrospectively studied. Dynamic data of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were collected. RESULTS: On admission, compared with moderate cases, severe and critical cases showed significantly decreased levels of total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells. IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the critical group. During the following hospitalization period, most of the lymphocyte subsets in the critical group began to recover to levels comparable to those in the severe group from the fourth week after illness onset, except for NK cells, which recovered after the sixth week. A sustained decrease in the lymphocyte subsets and an increase in IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in the nonsurvivors until death. There was a strong negative correlation between IL-6 and IL-10 and total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: A sustained decrease in lymphocyte subsets, especially CD4+ T cells and NK cells, interacting with proinflammatory cytokine storms was associated with severe disease and poor prognosis in COVID-19.","output":"Dynamic changes in lymphocyte subsets and parallel cytokine levels in patients with severe and critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to more mental health problems. However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged 18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02C0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: ?0.07, 95% CI: ?0.10C?0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10C0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: ?0.30, 95% CI: ?0.34C?0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated.

Geographic variation in itself is associated with both case severity and allelic variation especially in strains from Indian origin (p < 0.000001).

The high degree of homology within the proteases active site and substrate conservation supports the identification of broad spectrum lead compounds. A previous study identified the compound ML188, also termed 16R, as an inhibitor of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL(pro). This study will detail the generation of a homology model of the 3CL(pro) of the human coronavirus OC43 and determine the potential of 16R to form a broad-spectrum lead compound. MODELLER was used to generate a suitable three-dimensional model of the OC43 3CL(pro) and the Prime module of Schr?dinger predicted the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16R within the 3CL(pro) active site. Molecular dynamics further confirmed ligand stability and hydrogen bonding networks. RESULTS: A high quality homology model of the OC43 3CL(pro) was successfully generated in an active conformation. Further studies reproduced the binding pose of 16R within the active site of the generated model, where its free energy of binding was shown to equal that of the 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. The stability of the ligand was subsequently confirmed by molecular dynamics. CONCLUSION: The lead compound 16R may represent a broad-spectrum inhibitor of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and potentially other coronaviruses. This study provides an atomistic structure of the 3CL(pro) of OC43 and supports further experimental validation of the inhibitory effects of 16R. These findings further confirm that the 3CL(pro) of coronaviruses can be inhibited by broad spectrum lead compounds.","output":"Human coronavirus OC43 3CL protease and the potential of ML188 as a broad-spectrum lead compound: Homology modelling and molecular dynamic studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 has been a dreadful one: a living nightmare that has changed and impacted the lives of many [...].","output":"The Year That Has Passed Us By: Animals in Our Life of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiomics is referred to as quantitative imaging of biomarkers used for clinical outcome prognosis or tumor characterization.

We carried out an update of a previous systematic review of all published clinical trials in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) from 1980 to 2019 to document any reported serious adverse events (SAEs). METHODS For this updated systematic review, we searched the following databases from 1st Jan 2016 through 2nd of May 2019: PUBMED, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and the Global Index Medicus. We included randomised and non-randomised interventional studies aimed at assessing therapeutic efficacy and extracted the number of SAEs reported within the first 30 days of treatment initiation. The incidence rate of death (IRD) from individual treatment arms were combined in a meta-analysis using random effects Poisson regression. RESULTS We identified 157 published studies enrolling 35,376 patients in 347 treatment arms. Pentavalent antimony was administered in 74 (21.3%), multiple-dose liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in 52 (15.0%), amphotericin b deoxycholate in 51 (14.7%), miltefosine in 33 (9.5%), amphotericin b fat/lipid/colloid/cholesterol in 31 (8.9%), and single-dose L-AmB in 17 (4.9%) arms. There was a total of 804 SAEs reported of which 793 (including 428 deaths) were extracted at study arm level (11 SAEs were reported at study level only). During the first 30 days, there were 285 (66.6%) deaths with the overall IRD estimated at 0.068 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.041-0.114; I2 = 81.4%; 95% prediction interval (PI): 0.001-2.779] per 1,000 person-days at risk; the rate was 0.628 [95% CI: 0.368-1.021; I2 = 82.5%] in Eastern Africa, and 0.041 [95% CI: 0.021-0.081; I2 = 68.1%] in the Indian Subcontinent. In 21 study arms which clearly indicated allowing the inclusion of patients with HIV co-infections the IRD was 0.575 [95% CI: 0.244-1.355; I2 = 91.9%] compared to 0.043 [95% CI: 0.020-0.090; I2 = 62.5%] in 160 arms which excluded HIV co-infections. CONCLUSION Mortality within the first 30 days of VL treatment initiation was a rarely reported event in clinical trials with an overall estimated rate of 0.068 deaths per 1,000 person-days at risk, though it varied across regions and patient populations. These estimates may serve as a benchmark for future trials against which mortality data from prospective and pharmacovigilance studies can be compared. The methodological limitations exposed by our review support the need to assemble individual patient data (IPD) to conduct robust IPD meta-analyses and generate stronger evidence from existing trials to support treatment guidelines and guide future research.","output":"Serious adverse events following treatment of visceral leishmaniasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Guangdong government implemented lockdown measures on January 23, 2020, to ease the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We identified robust positive associations between the genetic architecture of severe COVID-19 and both BMI and smoking. We observed strong positive genetic correlation (rg) with diabetes (rg = 0.25) and shortness of breath walking on level ground (rg = 0.28) and novel protective associations with vitamin E (rg = ? 0.53), calcium (rg = ? 0.33), retinol (rg = ? 0.59), Apolipoprotein A (rg = ? 0.13), and HDL (rg = ? 0.17), but no association with vitamin D (rg = ? 0.02). Removing genomic regions associated with smoking and BMI generally attenuated the associations, but the associations with nutrient biomarkers persisted. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the shared genetic architecture of COVID-19 severity and numerous clinical/physiologic parameters. Associations with blood and plasma-derived traits identified biomarkers for Mendelian randomization studies to explore causality and nominates therapeutic targets for clinical evaluation.","output":"Shared genomic architecture between COVID-19 severity and numerous clinical and physiologic parameters revealed by LD score regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract provided.","output":"Palliative care in Malaysia: the need to do much more."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 As the number of COVID-19 cases rise, we are learning more about the course of the viral infection The effect of the virus on the liver and mechanism of injury is not yet well understood We present a case of SARS-CoV-2 induced hypoxemic hepatitis CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: Our 37 year old healthy patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure He required maximal noninvasive oxygen supplementation during his protracted course;yet, he did not require intubation The standard maximal medical treatment was provided On day 24 of hospital admission, the patient's liver enzymes peaked at ALT of 756 U/L and AST of 153 U/L and ALP of 80 U/L As part of the acute liver injury workup, a viral hepatitis panel and ultrasound of the abdomen were obtained Viral hepatitis panel was negative, and ultrasound showed hepatic steatosis with no cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, or biliary ductal dilatation Our patient had a BMI of 34 1 with elevated liver enzymes on admission, hence undiagnosed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was considered in our patient Greater susceptibility to the hepatotoxic effects of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing liver disease such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been demonstrated Our patient was able to tolerate lower amount of oxygen supplementation and had a good clinical outcome He was discharged home with normalizing transaminases and provided outpatient follow up DISCUSSION: This represents a unique case of COVID-19 induced hypoxemic hepatitis which has not been reported before As our understanding of COVID-19 infection evolves more cases will be added to the literature and help broaden our understanding of COVID-19 and its effects on the liver","output":"A case of covid-19-induced hypoxemic hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Latest research shows that SERPINE1 overexpression has an important role in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This increased awareness has led to the realisation that existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to individuals, groups, society, and the environment from AI harms. In response to this realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics codes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear that a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and the practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is possible to close this gap between the what and the how of AI ethics through the use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and designers translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of closure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and methods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too strict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with technical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of algorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile? And, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is the question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical translational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these limitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a concept that has been termed Ethics as a Service.","output":"Ethics as a Service: A Pragmatic Operationalisation of AI Ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has long been understood as a condition where both thrombotic and hemostatic abnormalities coexist. DIC is a difficult complication for clinicians to manage as it is due to multiple underlying complications of pathophysiologic abnormalities in diverse disease states. Ongoing research continues to define the meaning of DIC, evaluate therapeutic options, and how it presents with the complex paradigm of systemic activation of coagulation. In this review we introduce the current topis regarding this tough situation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Online search of published medical literature through MEDLINE and Web of Sience using the term \\"disseminated intravascular coagulation\\", \\"coagulopathy\\", \\"coagulation disorder\\", \\"hemostasis\\", \\"fibrinolysis\\", \\"thrombus\\" and \\"anticoagulants\\". EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, hemostasis and thrombosis in sepsis, COVID-19, trauma, and obstetrics. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. CONCLUSIONS: DIC is recognized as a pathologically triggered and dysregulated systemic activation of coagulation in response to various noxious stimuli. DIC's phenotype and clinical manifestations can vary from prothrombotic to hemorrhagic, depending on the underlying diseases. However, the fundamental mechanisms of systemic and vascular endothelial dysfunction can be explained as different phases of the acute response, with an initial prothrombotic phase that can commonly change to hemostatic insufficiency. Thrombin is the key initiator of the pathophysiologic process along with endothelial injury and initially fibrinolysis activation followed by fibrinolysis suppression. There is no established approach for managing DIC beyond initially treating the underlying disease and replacement therapy for the management of coagulopathy. Targeting anticoagulation therapy with antithrombin concentrates and recombinant thrombomodulin for the prevention of microthrombus formation, and antifibrinolytic therapy using tranexamic acid for the coagulopathy after massive bleeding, continue to be studied as therapeutic options.","output":"Therapeutic strategies in patients with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation: awareness of the phase-dependent characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Servant Leadership is a holistic approach whereby leaders act with morality, showing great concern for the companys stakeholders and engaging followers in multiple dimensions, such as emotional, relational and ethical, to bring out their full potential and empower them to grow into what they are capable of becoming. Servant leadership has been linked through various mediators to positive individual and collective outcomes, including behavioral, attitudinal, and performance. Among follower attitudinal outcomes, the present study aims at deepening the relationship between servant leadership and employee engagement in a large Italian consulting firm; first, by assessing the implementation of a servant leadership approach through a survey based on SL-7; second, by qualitatively investigating the servant leadership experiences lived by junior employees and their influence on individual engagement though a semi-structured questionnaire. The findings of the study suggest that employee engagement is positively influenced by servant leadership through various mediators, either leader-centered, such as empowerment, team-centered, such as team cohesion, organization-centered, such as positive organizational climate, job-centered, such as challenging tasks, and employee-centered, such as proactive personality. Some factors also emerged to hinder the relationship between servant leadership and employee engagement, particularly those related to the working environment: namely, high pressure, poor work-life balance and remote-working.

METHODS The Fit-4-Home trial was a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial conducted from April 2019 to February 2021. Patients undergoing elective surgery for liver, stomach or pancreatic cancer in two Australian hospitals were recruited. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an individualised, targeted step count intervention and usual care (intervention) or usual care alone (control). A wearable activity tracker was provided to the intervention group to monitor their daily step count target. Primary outcome was the length of stay in the gastrointestinal ward. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complication rates, discharge destination, quality of life, physical activity, pain, fatigue, distress and hospital re-admission within 30 days. Outcome measures were compared between groups using non-parametric statistics. RESULTS Of the 96 patients recruited, 47 were randomised to the intervention group and 49 were randomised to the control group. The median (interquartile) length of stay in the ward was 7 days (5.0-13.0) in the intervention group and 7 days (5.0- 12.0) in the control group (p = 0.330). Fatigue scores were worse in the intervention group when compared to control (p = 0.018). No other differences between groups were observed. CONCLUSIONS An individualised, daily targeted step count intervention and usual care did not confer additional benefits in reducing the length of stay in the ward compared to usual care alone for patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery.

Here, we estimate the infection-fatality risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New York City, NY, USA, the first epidemic centre in the USA, where the infection-fatality risk remains unclear. METHODS: In this model-based analysis, we developed a meta-population network model-inference system to estimate the underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in New York City during the 2020 spring pandemic wave using available case, mortality, and mobility data. Based on these estimates, we further estimated the infection-fatality risk for all ages overall and for five age groups (<25, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and &#8805;75 years) separately, during the period March 1 to June 6, 2020 (ie, before the city began a phased reopening). FINDINGS: During the period March 1 to June 6, 2020, 205a639 people had a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 21a447 confirmed and probable COVID-19-related deaths occurred among residents of New York City. We estimated an overall infection-fatality risk of 139% (95% credible interval 104-177) in New York City. Our estimated infection-fatality risk for the two oldest age groups (65-74 and &#8805;75 years) was much higher than the younger age groups, with a cumulative estimated infection-fatality risk of 0116% (00729-0148) for those aged 25-44 years and 0939% (0729-119) for those aged 45-64 years versus 487% (337-689) for those aged 65-74 years and 142% (102-181) for those aged 75 years and older. In particular, weekly infection-fatality risk was estimated to be as high as 672% (552-801) for those aged 65-74 years and 191% (147-219) for those aged 75 years and older. INTERPRETATION: Our results are based on more complete ascertainment of COVID-19-related deaths in New York City than other places and thus probably reflect the true higher burden of death due to COVID-19 than that previously reported elsewhere. Given the high infection-fatality risk of SARS-CoV-2, governments must account for and closely monitor the infection rate and population health outcomes and enact prompt public health responses accordingly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds.

The magnitude and speed of the shift to VCIs, the lack of existing research around bias and VCIs, and the underlying stress on all involved related to the pandemic put programs at risk of implementing virtual interviews without fully exploring their implications for diversity and equity. VCIs can promote diversity efforts by reducing the need for travel, making interviews more convenient and cost-effective for applicants. However, VCIs may also introduce new biases and amplify existing biases in recruitment. VCIs introduce a dependence on technology to conduct the interview process, which may amplify systemic inequities in access to broadband internet and high-quality hardware. Communication delays due to technology challenges may negatively affect interview scores. Additionally, users experience increased cognitive load when participating in videoconferences, which can activate implicit biases. Exposure to cues in the interviewee's personal living situation previously unavailable to interviewers may lead to unconscious assumptions by interviewers, which may also influence scoring. Graduate medical education programs committed to maintaining equitable recruitment processes must be able to recognize potential biases in VCIs and implement strategies to mitigate them. This article identifies some of the biases VCIs can introduce to the recruitment process and offers strategies for programs to mitigate them. These include making interviewers aware of potential technology-based inequities, encouraging interviewers to minimize multi-tasking, and offering guidance on use of standardized backgrounds. The authors also recognize the limitations of offering behavioral strategies to mitigate systemic inequities and suggest that structural changes are needed to ensure equitable access to technology.","output":"Avoiding the Virtual Pitfall: Identifying and Mitigating Biases in Graduate Medical Education Videoconference Interviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a relatively rare chronic immune-mediated liver disease, which develops in genetically predisposed individuals following an environmental trigger.

Materials and Methods: This multicentric observational study collected clinical data of adult patients who had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and thereafter were diagnosed with AIH between 03/2021 and 10/2021 in Italy, using an online survey among members of the Italian Association for the study of the Liver (AISF). Results: Among the 12 patients included: 50% were females, median age 62 years (range 32-80), 6 (50%) had preexisting extrahepatic autoimmune disease (3 thyroiditis, 2 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus), 7 patients have received Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine, 2 Spikevax (Moderna Biotech) and 3 Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca). Ten patients (83%) had acute onset of AIH with transaminase levels 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN, range 13-77 x ULN), 8 (67%) with jaundice (total bilirubin 3.5-18.6 x ULN). At AIH diagnosis (median time from first and second vaccine dose: 48 and 10 days, respectively) median AST was 18 x ULN (range 5-85), ALT 23.8 x ULN (range 7-83), total bilirubin 3.8 x ULN (range 0.6-18.6), alkaline phosphatase 1.3 x ULN (range 0.8-7.1), immunoglobulin G 1.2 x ULN (median 0.8-1.5).

In recent years, the study of paths in temporal graphs, that is, graphs where the vertex set is fixed but the edge set changes over time, gained more and more attention. A path is time-respecting, or temporal, if it uses edges with non-decreasing time stamps. We investigate a basic constraint for temporal paths, where the time spent at each vertex must not exceed a given duration $\\\\Delta$, referred to as $\\\\Delta$-restless temporal paths. This constraint arises naturally in the modeling of real-world processes like packet routing in communication networks and infection transmission routes of diseases where recovery confers lasting resistance. While finding temporal paths without waiting time restrictions is known to be doable in polynomial time, we show that the\\"restless variant\\"of this problem becomes computationally hard even in very restrictive settings. For example, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the distance to disjoint path of the underlying graph, which implies W[1]-hardness for many other parameters like feedback vertex number and pathwidth. A natural question is thus whether the problem becomes tractable in some natural settings. We explore several natural parameterizations, presenting FPT algorithms for three kinds of parameters: (1) output-related parameters (here, the maximum length of the path), (2) classical parameters applied to the underlying graph (e.g., feedback edge number), and (3) a new parameter called timed feedback vertex number, which captures finer-grained temporal features of the input temporal graph, and which may be of interest beyond this work.","output":"The Computational Complexity of Finding Temporal Paths under Waiting Time Constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The pipeline embolization device (PED) is a flow diverter that has shown promise in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Close to one-fifth of aneurysms, however, fail to occlude after PED placement. This study aims to identify anatomical features and clinicopathologic factors that may predispose failed aneurysm occlusion with the PED. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all anterior circulation unruptured saccular aneurysms treated with the PED in a single-center. The primary outcome measure was angiographic occlusion. Anatomical features and potential predictors, including gender, aneurysm location, size, height, aspect ratio, neck width, prior treatment and the number of PED, were studied using binary logistic regression. RESULTS 29 anterior circulation unruptured saccular aneurysms with a mean size of 6.99 mm treated with the PED in a single center were retrospectively studied. The overall occlusion rate was 79.3% after a mean follow-up of 9.2 months. Four aneurysms were related to the fetal-type posterior communicating artery (PComA), and all were refractory to flow diverter treatment. Female gender was significantly associated with a higher occlusion rate. We present the anatomical features and propose possible pathophysiological mechanisms of these PComA aneurysms that failed flow diverter treatment. CONCLUSION A PComA aneurysm with persistent fetal-type circulation appears to be particularly refractory to flow diverter treatment, especially when the aneurysm incorporates a significant portion of the PComA. Our experience suggested that flow diverting stents alone may not be the ideal treatment for this subgroup of aneurysms, and alternative modalities should be considered.

The cDNA sequence of TsT gene was cloned and expressed. Western blotting showed rTsT was identified by infection serum and anti-TsT serum. RT-PCR results revealed that TsT gene was transcribed at diverse T. spiralis lifecycle stages. The IIFT results showed that natural TsT was principally expressed at epicuticle of 5-6 day adult worms, indicating that TsT is a worm somatic antigen and adult-stage specific surface antigen. Vaccination of mice with rTsT triggered an evident humoral immune response (high levels of serum IgG, IgG1/IgG2a, and enteral sIgA), and it also induced the systemic and enteral local cellular immune response, demonstrated by an significantly elevation of cytokines IFN-?3 and IL-4. The mice vaccinated with rTsT exhibited a 33.17% reduction of enteral adult worms and a 37.80% reduction of muscle larvae after larval challenge.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the number of intravitreal aflibercept injections administered in the loading phase. The 3+PRN group comprised 27 patients, whereas the 5+PRN group comprised 33 patients. The visual and anatomical outcomes were compared between the two groups at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS Both 3+PRN and 5+PRN, showed statistically significant improvements in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thicknesse throughout the study period (p<0.001 and, p<0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of changes in the best-corrected visual acuity and central macular thickness (p=0.453 and, p=0.784, respectively).

The relationships between these variables and the changes in clinical activity, the treated patients' COVID-19 status and the implementation of protective measures in the dental clinic were analyzed. A total of 436 (70.6% women) dentists from 59 countries responded to the survey. Clinical activity was reduced or stopped for 79.1% of respondents. The most common change was to limit treatment to urgent care only (53.7%). Treatment under general anesthesia or deep sedation was discontinued (51.0%) or reduced (35.8%) for the majority of respondents. Male dentists were more likely to maintain their clinical activity than female dentists (p < 0.001), and respondents from North America were more likely to do so than participants from other geographical regions (p < 0.001). Dentists from Latin America and the Caribbean were more likely to report treatment of confirmed cases of COVID-19 than those from Europe (p < 0.001).

PURPOSE We assess the incidence of adult-onset (20 years) T1D, by country, from available data. DATA SOURCES A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, and the gray literature, through 11 May 2021, was undertaken. STUDY SELECTION We included all population-based studies reporting on adult-onset T1D incidence and published from 1990 onward in English. DATA EXTRACTION With the search we identified 1,374 references of which 46 were included for data extraction. Estimates of annual T1D incidence were allocated into broad age categories (20-39, 40-59, 60, or 20 years) as appropriate. DATA SYNTHESIS Overall, we observed the following patterns: 1) there is a paucity of data, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; 2) the incidence of adult-onset T1D is lowest in Asian and highest in Nordic countries; 3) adult-onset T1D is higher in men versus women; 4) it is unclear whether adult-onset T1D incidence declines with increasing age; and 5) it is unclear whether incidence of adult-onset T1D has changed over time. LIMITATIONS Results are generalizable to high-income countries, and misclassification of diabetes type cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS From available data, this systematic review suggests that the incidence of T1D in adulthood is substantial and highlights the pressing need to better distinguish T1D from T2D in adults so that we may better assess and respond to the true burden of T1D in adults.","output":"The Incidence of Adult-Onset Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review From 32 Countries and Regions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For Germany it is predicted that the first wave of the corona pandemic disease reaches its maximum of new infections on April 11th, 2020 +5.4-3.4 days with 90 percent confidence.

This study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among individuals who were never diagnosed with COVID-19 in Daegu, the epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Serologic testing for immunoglobulin G antibody based on immunochromatographic assay was conducted in 103 patients and 95 guardians aged 18 to 82 years without any history of COVID-19 diagnosis, who visited outpatient clinics of a single university-affiliated hospital from May 25 to June 5, 2020.

Compared to a common viral pneumonia it may evolve in an atypical way, causing the rapid death of the patient. For over two centuries, autopsy has been recognized as a fundamental diagnostic technique, particularly for new or little-known diseases. To date, it is often considered obsolete giving the inadequacy to provide samples of a quality appropriate to the sophisticated diagnostic techniques available today. This is probably one of the reasons why during this pandemic autopsies were often requested only in few cases, late and discouraged, if not prohibited, by more than one nation. This is in contrast with our firm conviction: to understand the unknown we must look at it directly and with our own eyes. This has led us to implement an autopsy procedure that allows the beginning of the autopsy shortly after death (within 1C2 h) and its rapid execution, also including sampling for ultrastructural and molecular investigations. In our experience, the tissue sample collected for diagnosis and research were of quality similar to biopsy or surgical resections. This procedure was performed ensuring staff and environmental safety. We want to propose our experience, our main qualitative results and a few general considerations, hoping that they can be an incentive to use autopsy with a new procedure adjusted to match the diagnostic challenges of the third millennium.","output":"The autopsy at the time of SARS-CoV-2: Protocol and lessons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shoes play an important role in sports and human daily life. Here, an in-shoe sensor pad (ISSP) attached to the vamp lining is based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for monitoring the real-time stress distribution on the top side of a foot. Each sensor unit on this ISSP is an air-capsule TENG (AC-TENG) consisting of activated carbon/polyurethane (AC/PU) and microsphere array electrodes. The detection range of each AC-TENG reaches 7.27 MPa, which is enough for monitoring the pressure change during different sports. This multifunctional ISSP can realize many typical functions of conventional smart shoes, including step counting and human-machine interaction. Moreover, it can also reveal special information, including the fitness of shoes, the stress concentration on toes, and the in-motion comfort degree. The signal processing and data transmission modules in the system have a hybrid power supply with wireless power transfer, while the real-time information about feet can be observed on a cell phone. Hence, this ISSP provides a potential approach to study the feet motion and comfort degree of shoes in long-term operations, which can guide both athlete training and the customized design of shoes.","output":"Monitoring the Degree of Comfort of Shoes In-Motion Using Triboelectric Pressure Sensors with an Ultrawide Detection Range"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported that residents of low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

Knowledge of organizational protective and risk factors is central to maintaining staff psychosocial well-being and client care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study with caregivers and leadership personnel is to identify specific protective and stress factors of staff members accompanying people with disabilities. This allows conclusions to be drawn about necessary adjustments to leadership in crisis situations. METHODOLOGY: Between October and December 2020, online-based expert interviews (N = 11) were conducted with staff members of Lebenshilfe Tirol. By applying axial coding of grounded theory, a model was created to explain the experience of health care workers in disability care. RESULTS: Stressful experience during the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by uncertainty and a feeling of being overwhelmed, which were caused by the novelty of the situation, an excess of information, and altered working conditions with reduced participation. Positive experience was associated with meaningfulness as well as flat hierarchies and identification with the organization. By adapting the leadership behavior of the organisation, which before the crisis was characterized by flat hierarchies, it was possible to respond successfully to the pandemic. DISCUSSION: The results of this study point to changed demands on leadership behavior and a need for increased directive leadership during crises. This change from participative to directive leadership has to be accompanied by dialogue with all stakeholders in order to be accepted.","output":"Fhren in der Krise C organisationales Krisenmanagement w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie (?coronavirus disease 2019) am Beispiel der Lebenshilfe Tirol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aside from the dramatic effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the lives of people everywhere, it has also triggered and accelerated some important process changes in healthcare.

However, the extent to which methamphetamine involvement in deaths differs from those changes occurring in synthetic opioid involvement is unknown. OBJECTIVES To determine the patterns and temporal changes in methamphetamine-related deaths with and without other drug involvement. METHODS Data from all methamphetamine-related deaths in West Virginia from 2013 to 2018 were analyzed. Quasi-Poisson regression analyses over time were conducted to compare the rates of change in death counts among methamphetamine and fentanyl//FA subgroups. RESULTS A total of 815 methamphetamine-related deaths were analyzed; 572 (70.2%) were male and 527 (64.7%) involved an opioid. The proportion of methamphetamine only deaths stayed relatively flat over time although the actual numbers of deaths increased. Combined fentanyl/FAs and methamphetamine were involved in 337 deaths (41.3%) and constituted the largest increase from 2013 to 2018. The modeling of monthly death counts in 2017-2018 found that the average number of deaths involving fentanyl without methamphetamine significantly declined (rate of change -0.025, p < .001), while concomitant fentanyl with methamphetamine and methamphetamine only death counts increased significantly (rate of change 0.056 and 0.057, respectively, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Fentanyl and FAs played an increasingly significant role in methamphetamine-related deaths. The accelerating number of deaths involving fentanyl/FAs and methamphetamine indicates the importance of stimulants and opioids in unintentional deaths. Comprehensive surveillance efforts should continue to track substance use patterns to ensure that appropriate prevention programs are undertaken.","output":"Fentanyl and other opioid involvement in methamphetamine-related deaths."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inverted papilloma is the most common benign tumor of the paranasal sinuses with the possibility of malignant transformation.

The proposed systems are applicable to most incidence rates that are used in the literature including the bilinear incidence rate, the Beddington-DeAngelis incidence rate, and a Holling type II functional response.

We assume that the direct observation of the percentage of hidden state individuals that are infected, $\\\\alpha(t)$, is not given and only a noise-corrupted observation process is available. Using the nonlinear filtering techniques in conjunction with an invasion type analysis (or analysis using Lyapunov exponents from the dynamical system point of view), this paper proves that the long-term behavior of the disease is governed by a threshold $\\\\lambda\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ that depends on the model parameters. It turns out that if $\\\\lambda<0$ the number $I(t)$ of infected individuals converges to zero exponentially fast, or the extinction happens.

However, the illness had lasted for several days before admission to the hospital, therefore the potentially beneficial effect of antibiotic treatment at an early stage of the disease cannot be assessed.

We calculated the proportion of patients diagnosed with PNES within the first 8 hours of EEG recording and studied the associated risk factors for patients diagnosed with PNES and patients with epileptic seizures (ES). Out of the total 616 patients, 24% (149) patients had an EMU diagnosis of PNES. Of these, 44.3% had at least one typical event within the first 8 hours of vEEG monitoring.

To date, no specific treatment strategy was approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID\\\\19 in terms of endotheliitis\\\\related comorbidities. Here, we presented our treatment strategies for 11 190 COVID\\\\19 patients depending on categorisation by the severity of both the respiratory and vascular distress and presented the manifestations of endotheliitis in skin, lung and brain tissues according to the different phases of COVID\\\\19. METHODS: After a retrospective examination, patients were divided into three groups according to their repercussions of vascular distress, which were represented by radiological, histopathological and clinical findings. We presented the characteristics and courses of seven representative and complicated cases which demonstrate different phases of the disease and discussed the treatment strategies in each group. RESULTS: Among 11 190 patients, 9294 patients met the criteria for Group A, and 1376 patients were presented to our clinics with Group B characteristics. Among these patients, 1896 individuals (Group B and Group C) were hospitalised. While 1220 inpatients were hospitalised within the first 10 days after the diagnosis, 676 of them were worsened and hospitalised 10 days after their diagnosis.

In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misconceptions like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.","output":"The Weighted Average Illusion: Biases in Perceived Mean Position in Scatterplots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been traditionally considered poor candidates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) because of high in-hospital mortality and poor long-term survival.

The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.","output":"Opioid-Associated Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Distinctive Clinical Features and Implications for Health Care and Public Responses: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has cast increased attention on emerging infections. Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis. SUMMARY: Infectious causes of encephalitis continue to emerge worldwide, in part because of climate change and human impacts on the environment. Expansion of surveillance measures will be critical in rapid diagnosis and limiting of outbreaks in the future.","output":"Emerging infectious encephalitides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a novel virus that results in a variety of clinical manifestations.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsPost-authorization national population-based surveillance using the French enhanced pharmacovigilance surveillance system for COVID-19 vaccines. All cases of suspected hyper-inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12- 17-year-old children between June 15th, 2021 and January 1st, 2022, were reported. Each case was assessed for WHO MIS-C criteria. Causality assessment followed 2019 WHO recommendations. ExposureCOVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Main Outcome and MeasuresThe main outcome was the reporting rate of post-vaccine hyper-inflammatory syndrome per 1,000,000 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses in 12-17-year-old children. This reporting rate was compared to the MIS-C rate per 1,000,000 12-17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. Secondary outcomes included the comparison of clinical features between post-vaccine hyper-inflammatory syndrome and post SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C. ResultsFrom June 2021 to January 2022, 8,113,058 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses were administered to 4,079,234 12-17-year-old children. Among them, 9 presented a multisystemic hyper-inflammatory syndrome. All cases fulfilled MIS-C WHO criteria. Main clinical features included male predominance (8/9, 89%), cardiac involvement (8/9, 89%), digestive symptoms (7/9, 78%), coagulopathy (5/9, 54%), cytolytic hepatitis (4/9, 46%), and shock (3/9, 33%). 3/9 (33%) required intensive care unit transfer, and 2/9 (22%) hemodynamic support. All cases recovered. Only three cases had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reporting rate was 1.1 (95%CI [0.5; 2.1]) per 1,000,000 doses injected. As a comparison, 113 MIS-C (95%CI [95; 135]) occurred per 1,000,000 12-17-year-old children infected by SARS-CoV-2. Clinical features (inflammatory parameters, cytopenia) slightly differed from post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C, along with short-term outcomes (less PICU transfer than MIS-C). Conclusion and RelevanceVery few cases of hyper-inflammatory syndromes with multi-organ involvement occurred following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17-year-old children. The low reporting rate of this syndrome, compared to the rate of MIS-C among same age children infected by SARS-CoV-2, supports the benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children. Further studies are required to explore specific pathways of this entity compared to post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C. Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17-year-old children associated with subsequent multisystemic hyper-inflammatory syndrome? FindingsThe French national pharmacovigilance system identified 9 children with a hyper-inflammatory syndrome with multi-organ involvement following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (reporting rate 1.1 [0.5; 2.1] per 1,000,000 doses), of which only three had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. All cases fulfilled WHO definition for MIS-C, but clinical and immunological features, along with short-term outcomes, slightly differed from classical post SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C. MeaningVery rare cases of hyper-inflammatory syndrome can occur following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in 12-17-year-old children. The very low rate of this entity, compared to classical post-SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C, supports the benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children.","output":"Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in children: a national post-authorization pharmacovigilance study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we study the dynamical behavior of a modified SIR epidemiological model by introducing negative feedback and a nonpharmaceutical intervention.

Controlling the information about nonpharmaceutical interventions is considered by the addition of a new variable that measures how the behavioral changes about isolation influence pandemics. An analytic expression of a replacement ratio that depends on the absence of the negative feedback is determined. The results obtained show that the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is determined by the value of a certain threshold parameter called the basic reproductive number [Formula: see text] and the local stability of the free disease equilibrium depends on the replacement ratios. A Hopf bifurcation is analytically verified for the delay parameter. The qualitative analysis shows that the feedback information index promotes more changes to the propagation of the disease than other parameters.

Seventy-five records were identified, of which 13 met our inclusion criteria. In a systematic review we asked: (1) What is the proportion of nonunions with poller screw usage? (2) What is the proportion of malalignment, infection and secondary surgical procedures with poller screw usage? The overall outcome proportion across the studies was computed using the inverse variance method for pooling.Thirteen studies with a total of 371 participants and 376 fractures were included. Mean follow-up time was 21.1 months. Mean age of included patients was 40.0 years. Seven studies had heterogenous populations of nonunions and acute fractures. Four studies included only acute fractures and two studies examined nonunions only.The results of the present systematic review show a low complication rate of IM nailing augmented with poller screws in terms of nonunion (4%, CI: 0.03-0.07), coronal plane malunion (5%, CI: 0.03-0.08), deep (5%, CI: 0.03-0.11) and superficial (6%, CI: 0.03-0.11) infections, and secondary procedures (8%, CI: 0.04-0.18).When compared with the existing literature our review suggests intramedullary nailing with poller screws has lower rates of nonunion and coronal malalignment when compared with nailing alone.

However, certain medical conditions or contraindications warrant a reduction, modification or cessation of activity due to potential health risks. AIM To review and evaluate the evidence related to medical disorders which may warrant contraindication to prenatal exercise. METHODS Online databases were searched up to 5 April 2019. Forty-four unique studies that reported data on our Population (pregnant women with contraindication to exercise), Intervention (subjective/objective measures of acute or chronic exercise), Comparator (not essential) and Outcomes (adverse maternal or fetal outcomes) were included in the review. KEY FINDINGS We found that the majority of medical conditions listed as contraindications were based on expert opinion; there is minimal empirical evidence to demonstrate harm of exercise and benefit of activity restriction. We identified 11 complications (eg, gestational hypertension, twin pregnancy) previously classified as contraindications where women may in fact benefit from regular prenatal physical activity with or without modifications. However, the evidence suggests that severe cardiorespiratory disease, placental abruption, vasa previa, uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, active preterm labour, severe pre-eclampsia and cervical insufficiency are associated with strong potential for maternal/fetal harm and warrant classification as absolute contraindications. CONCLUSION Based on empirical evidence, we provide a call to re-evaluate clinical guidelines related to medical disorders that have previously been considered contraindications to prenatal exercise. Removing barriers to physical activity during pregnancy for women with certain medical conditions may in fact be beneficial for maternal-fetal health outcomes.","output":"Why can't I exercise during pregnancy?

Human CoV strains discovered during previous SARS outbreaks have been hypothesized to pass from bats to humans using intermediate hosts, e.g. civets for SARS-CoV and camels for MERS-CoV. The discovery of an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 and the identification of specific mechanism of its emergence in humans are topics of primary evolutionary importance. In this study we investigate the evolutionary patterns of 11 main genes of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies suggested that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to the horseshoe bat coronavirus RaTG13 for most of the genes and to some Malayan pangolin coronavirus (CoV) strains for the receptor binding (RB) domain of the spike protein. Results We provide a detailed list of statistically significant horizontal gene transfer and recombination events (both intergenic and intragenic) inferred for each of 11 main genes of the SARS-Cov-2 genome. Our analysis reveals that two continuous regions of genes S and N of SARS-CoV-2 may result from intragenic recombination between RaTG13 and Guangdong (GD) Pangolin CoVs. Statistically significant gene transfer-recombination events between RaTG13 and GD Pangolin CoV have been identified in region [1215-1425] of gene S and region [534-727] of gene N. Moreover, some significant recombination events between the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, GD Pangolin CoV and bat CoV ZC45-ZXC21 coronaviruses have been identified in genes ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 and N. Furthermore, topology-based clustering of gene trees inferred for 25 CoV organisms revealed a three-way evolution of coronavirus genes, with gene phylogenies of ORF1ab, S and N forming the first cluster, gene phylogenies of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 forming the second cluster, and phylogeny of gene ORF10 forming the third cluster. Conclusions The results of our horizontal gene transfer and recombination analysis suggest that SARS-Cov-2 could not only be a chimera resulting from recombination of the bat RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses but also a close relative of the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21 strains. They also indicate that a GD pangolin may be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Horizontal gene transfer and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genes helps discover its close relatives and shed light on its origin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 13-month-old immunized female is seen in the pediatricians office for evaluation of fever.

A major site of ApoD expression in mice is the central nervous system where evidence suggests that it plays a protective role. Gene expression of ApoD was reported in bone-forming osteoblasts but its impact on bone metabolism remains undocumented. METHODS: We compared basic bone parameters of ApoD(?/?) (null) and transgenic (tg) mice to wild-type (wt) littermates through microCT and histochemistry, as well as ApoD expression and secretion in osteoblasts under various culture conditions through real-time PCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9 months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.

METHODS Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models.

Eight groups, of ten pigs each, were vaccinated with either vaccine A or B, intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID). Two different vaccination-challenge intervals were used for each vaccine. Furthermore, one group was vaccinated with a tenfold ID dose of vaccine A and one non-vaccinated group served as a control group. Five pigs from each group were challenged with the moderately virulent CSFV strain Paderborn, while the remaining five pigs served as contacts. Using vaccine A, full transmission to all contact pigs in both ID vaccinated groups occurred. No virus transmission was observed when IM vaccinated pigs were challenged 14 days post-vaccination (14dpv) whereas only one out of five contact pig became infected when they were challenged 10dpv. Using vaccine B no virus transmission was observed when pigs were ID or IM vaccinated and challenged 10dpv.

NPA contained different groups of organisms and these were classified into bacterial (n = 27), viral (n = 5), codetection [containing both viral and bacterial transcripts (n = 21), or indeterminate intermediate where microbial load is below threshold (n = 5)]. We then identified differentially expressed immune transcripts (DEITs) comparing NPAs from symptomatic children vs. healthy controls, and comparing children presenting NPAs with detectable microbial load vs. indeterminate. We observed a strong innate immune response in NPAs, due to the presence of evolutionarily conserved type I Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISG), which was correlated with total bacterial and/or viral load. In comparison with indeterminate NPAs, adaptive immunity transcripts discriminated among viral, bacterial, and codetected microbial profiles. In viral NPAs, B cell transcripts were significantly enriched among DEITs, while only type III IFN was correlated with viral load. In bacterial NPAs, myeloid cells and coinhibitory transcripts were enriched and significantly correlated with bacterial load.

We investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with a history of cancer admitted to two large hospitals between March 13, 2020, and May 10, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched them 1:2 to patients without a history of cancer. RESULTS: Men made up 56.2% of the population, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-96). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 35.6 months (range, 0.39-435); 80% had a solid tumor, and 20% had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 27.8% died or entered hospice versus 25.6% among patients without cancer. In multivariable analyses, the odds of death/hospice were similar (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.82). The odds of intubation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78), shock (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81) were lower for patients with a history of cancer versus controls. Patients with active cancer or who had received cancer-directed therapy in the past 6 months had similar odds of death/hospice compared with cancer survivors (univariable OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.66-2.60; multivariable OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.69-3.16). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality to matched hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without cancer, and a lower risk of complications. In this population, patients with active cancer or recent cancer treatment had a similar risk for adverse outcomes compared with survivors of cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death or hospice admission in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Active cancer, systemic cancer therapy, and a cancer history are not independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients without cancer are more likely to have severe COVID-19. These findings provide reassurance to survivors of cancer and patients with cancer as to their relative risk of severe COVID-19, may encourage oncologists to provide standard anticancer therapy in patients at risk of COVID-19, and guide triage in future waves of infection.","output":"Impact of Cancer History on Outcomes Among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telehealth to deliver psychiatric services.

However, many destination management models overlook the role of urban zoning. Little is known about the impacts of land-use zoning on the hospitality and property industries, especially with the current disruption of short-term peer-to-peer accommodation like Airbnb. Euclidean zoning, also known as effects-based planning, has long been criticised in destination management for its exclusionary nature and lack of flexibility. With exclusionary zoning, property owners may only be able to use their land sub-optimally, and cities will be less efficient in responding to market changes in short-term and long-term accommodation demands, but planning intentions can be better controlled, and the property supply can be more stable. Taking Hong Kong as a noteworthy case, this study puts forward a conceptual framework that enables comparison of a novel zoning approach with the traditional zoning approach. This novel zoning approach encompasses both the short- and long-term rental sectors as a continuum of accommodation, ranging from hotels and serviced apartments to Airbnb and rental housing units under a unified regulatory and planning regime to enhance the switching options value. This novel zoning system can gear up the tourism sector with the rapid growth of the sharing economy and aligns with sustainable tourism to ensure long-term socioeconomic benefits to related stakeholders.

Pooled frequencies of PE in patients with COVID-19 at the emergency department (ED), general wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) were 17.9% (95% CI: 12.0C23.8%), 23.9% (95% CI: 15.2C32.7%), and 48.6% (95% CI: 41.0C56.1%), respectively. PE was more commonly located in peripheral than in main pulmonary arteries (pooled frequency of 65.3% [95% CI: 60.0C70.1%] vs. 32.9% [95% CI: 26.7C39.0%]; OR = 3.540 [95% CI: 2.308C5.431%]). Patients with PE had significantly higher D-dimer levels (pooled SMD of 1.096 [95% CI, 0.844C1.349]). D-dimer cutoff levels which have been used to identify patients with PE varied between 1000 and 4800 g/L. CONCLUSION: The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries, which suggests local thrombosis to play a major role. D-dimer assessment may help to select patients with COVID-19 for CTPA, using D-dimer cutoff levels of at least 1000 g/L. KEY POINTS: ? The frequency of PE in patients with COVID-19 is highest in the ICU, followed by general wards and the ED. ? PE in COVID-19 is more commonly located in peripheral than in central pulmonary arteries. ? D-dimer levels are significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 who have PE.

A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were 65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected. RESULTS In this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers.

In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.","output":"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus proteins VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 antagonize IFNa1 promoter activation while VP1 induces IFNa1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are indications that children born during the period of COVID-19 lockdown have cognitive development issues, without having been affected by the virus.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the prevalence and analyzing the variables involved in the occurrence of violence against health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study conducted online involving Brazilian health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire (Google Online Form) sent to health professionals on social networks and analyzed through logistic regression by using sociodemographic variables. The set of grouped variables was assigned to the final model when p <0.05. A network was built using the Mixed Graph Models (MGM) approach. A centrality measurement chart was constructed to determine which nodes have the greatest influence, strength and connectivity between the nodes around them. RESULTS: The predictors of violence in the adjusted regression model were the following: being a nursing technician / assistant; having been working for less than 20 years; working for over 37 hours a week; having suffered violence before the pandemic; having been contaminated with COVID-19; working in direct contact with patients infected by the virus; and having family members who have suffered violence. The network created with professionals who suffered violence demonstrated that the aggressions occurred mainly in the workplace, with an indication of psycho-verbal violence. In cases in which the aggressors were close people, aggressions were non-verbal and happened both in public and private places. The assaults practiced by strangers occurred in public places. CONCLUSIONS: Violence against health professionals occurs implicitly and explicitly, with consequences that can affect both their psychosocial well-being and the assistance given to their patients and families.","output":"Predictors of violence against health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of this study were to examine possible differences and factors that contribute to risk perception and compliance with preventive measures at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 423 participants (M = 30.29, SD = 14.45;69% female). Compliance, risk perception and trust in information were significantly higher in T1 than T2. For risk perception, significant predictors in both T1 and T2 were age, Emotionality (HEXACO-PI-R) and Unrealistic Optimism (NLE, Negative Life Events). Trust in information was a significant predictor in T1, while Unrealistic Optimism (Positive Life Events) was a significant predictor in T2. For compliance, significant predictors in T1 were gender and trust in information while in T2 were Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness (HEXACO-PI-R), NLE and trust in information, for both T1 and T2. In general, findings suggest a much more pronounced role of personality traits in adherence to protective measures at the end than at the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a questionnaire, acoustically problematic rooms are identified. Noise levels in emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) are measured over about three days. Acoustically critical and problematic rooms in the otolaryngology department are measured including examination rooms, operating rooms, nurse stations, receptions, and patient rooms. RESULTS: The A-weighted equivalent noise level, L(Aeq), ranges from 54 to 56 dBA, which is at least 10 dB lower than the noise levels of 65 to 73 dBA measured in American ERs. In an ICU, the noise level for the first night was 66 dBA, which came down to 56 dBA for the next day. The noise levels during three different ear surgeries vary from 57 to 62 dBA, depending on the use of surgical drills and suctions. The noise levels in a patient room is found to be 47 dBA, while the nurse stations and the receptions have high noise levels up to 64 dBA. The reverberation times in an operation room, examination room, and single patient room are found to be below 0.6 s. CONCLUSIONS: At SNUH, the nurse stations and receptions were found to be quite noisy. The ERs were quieter than in the previous studies.

However, it has been suggested that individuals with Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and their families might have been particularly impacted by the first national lockdown in the UK. In contrast to previous studies, the current study examined wellbeing and anxiety at different time points and included a control group matched for family situation. Parents of 402 individuals with SEND reported on their own anxiety and wellbeing as well as that of their son/daughter at three time points (before COVID-19, when COVID-19 pandemic started, and during the national lockdown). In addition, data from 186 typically developing (TD) siblings was obtained. Repeated measures ANOVAs and regression analyses showed that, although both individuals with SEND and their TD siblings showed increased anxiety across the three time points, levels of anxiety were not predicted by age, gender or health. Instead, levels of anxiety in the SEND group, but not the TD siblings, were predicted by awareness about COVID-19, diagnosis of an existing anxiety disorder as well as parental anxiety. In addition, whilst TD individuals were reported to increasingly worry about social related issues as well as family related issues, those with SEND were reported to worry about issues related to school closures. These findings show that COVID-19 impacts the wellbeing of those with SEND differently to that of their TD siblings and that school closures have a particular effect on this group.

This descriptive observational study included all adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Internal Medicine ward of Hospital Durand between April 1, 2020 and July 30, 2020, who had blood cultures drawn within 5 days from hospital admission. Among 267 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, 38 had early blood cultures drawn. No clinically relevant microorganism was isolated from blood and contaminant microorganisms were recovered in 7 (18.4%) patients. This study found no evidence of bacteremia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the rate of contaminated blood cultures nearly doubles the reported in patients with community acquired pneumonia (10%), which may be explained by unfamiliarity of additional personal protective equipment worn by healthcare workers. Our results advocate against the routine indication of blood cultures upon admission to the Internal Medicine Ward of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

This prospective survey reports outcome on 272 COVID-19 patients from 19 countries having undergone allogeneic (n = 175) or autologous (n = 97) HCT reported to the EBMT registry or to the GETH. All patients had the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 documented by PCR. Patients were included in this analysis if COVID-19 diagnosis was before April 10, 2020. The overall survival was estimate by using the Kaplan Meier methods, considering the death due to any cause as an event and the time from COVID-19 infection to the latest follow-up as survival time; difference between groups were tested by the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate risk factor analysis for overall survival were performed with the Cox regression model. The median age was 54.4 years (1.0 - 80.3) for allogeneic and 60.9 years (7.7 - 73.4) for autologous HCT patients. 20 patients were children (< 18 years of age; median age 11.3 (1.0 - 16.9)). The median time from HCT to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 13.7 months (0.2 - 254.3) in allogeneic and 25.0 months (-0.9 - 350.3) in autologous recipients. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) developed in 84.8% and 21.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). At the time of analysis, 68/238 (28.6%) patients had died (47/155 allogeneic patients; 21/83 autologous patients). No follow-up had been received on 34 patients. The median time from infection to death was 19 days (0-102). Five patients were reported to have other primary causes of death than COVID-19. Of the patients reported to be alive, the median follow-up was 44 days. 144 (84.7%) patients (93 allogeneic; 51 autologous) had virologic resolution of the COVID-19 infection having at least one negative PCR. 26 patients were alive and known to be still COVID-19 positive (15 allogeneic; 11 autologous). For 34 patients the resolution status was unknown. Factors influencing the likelihood of resolution in multivariate analysis were underlying diagnosis (p=.01) and longer time from transplant to diagnosis of COVID-19 (p=.035). Overall survival at 6 weeks from COVID-19 diagnosis was 76.8% and 83.8% in allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients (p =ns), respectively (figure 1). Children (n=20) tended to do better with a 6-week survival of 95.0% although the difference was not significantly different (p =.12). In multivariate analysis of the total population older age (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.05 - 1.51; p = .01) increased the risk and better performance status decreased the risk for fatal outcome (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69 - 0.90; p = .0003). The same factors had significant impact on overall survival in allogeneic HCT recipients (age HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.05 - 1.55; p=.01; performance status HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68 - 0.92); p=.002) while only age impacted survival among autologous HCT patients (data not shown). Other transplant factors such as underlying diagnosis, time from HCT to diagnosis of COVID-19, graft-vs-host disease, or ongoing immunosuppression did not have a significant impact on overall survival. We conclude that HCT patients are at an increased risk compared to the general population to develop LRTD, require admission to ICU, and have increased mortality in COVID-19.

METHODS: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, two studies had a high risk of bias, eleven studies were scored as moderate risk of bias, and four studies were classified as low risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. CONCLUSION: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission. Therefore, the countries most affected by the disease should focus on health policies, even with climates less favorable to the virus.

The results of these studies have been inconsistent, however, leading to controversy over the essential assumptions underlying the research program, namely, whether bilingualism produces cognitive change. We argue that the source of the inconsistency is not in the evidence but rather in the framework that has typically been used to motivate the research and interpret the results. We examine the componential view of EF with its central role for inhibition and argue that it provides a poor fit to both bilingual experience and the results of these studies. As an alternative, we propose a more holistic account based on attentional control that overrides the processes in the componential model of EF and applies to a wider range of tasks. The key element in our account is that behavioral differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals reflect differences in the efficiency and deployment of attentional control between the two language groups. In support of this point we show how attentional control provides a more satisfactory account for a range of findings that cannot reasonably be attributed to inhibition. We also suggest that group differences will emerge only when the attentional demands of a task exceed the control abilities of one of the groups, regardless of the EF components involved. We then review literature from across the lifespan to evaluate the extent to which this account is consistent with existing evidence, and conclude with some suggestions on how the field may be advanced by new lines of empirical enquiry.","output":"How does bilingualism modify cognitive function?

Of 2512 COVID-19 patients, 35 (1.39%, mean age 63.3 years, 54% women) had AIS. AIS recognition was frequently delayed after COVID-19 symptoms (median 19.5 days). Four patients (31%) were on therapeutic anticoagulation at AIS recognition. AIS mechanism was undetermined or due to multiple etiologies in most cases (n=20, 57%). Three patients underwent IV TPA, and three underwent mechanical thrombectomy, of which two suffered re-occlusion. Three patients had incomplete mRNA vaccination course. Fourteen (40%) died with 26 (74%) having poor outcomes. Critical COVID-19 severity was associated with worsened mortality (p=0.02).

OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of reviews describing task shifts from physicians to allied healthcare workers in primary care and its impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched up to 15 December 2020, to identify reviews describing task shifting in primary care. Two reviewers independently screened the references for relevant studies, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using AMSTAR-2. RESULTS: Twenty-one reviews that described task shifting in primary care were included. Task shifted include provision of care for people with chronic conditions, medication prescribing, and health education. We found that task shifting could potentially improve several health outcomes such as blood pressure, HbA1c, and mental health while achieving cost savings. Key elements for successful implementation of task shifting include collaboration among all parties, a system for coordinated care, provider empowerment, patient preference, shared decision making, training and competency, supportive organisation system, clear process outcome, and financing. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that allied healthcare workers such as pharmacists and nurses can potentially undertake substantially expanded roles to support physicians in primary care in response to the changing health service demand. Tasks include providing care to patients, independent prescribing, counselling and education, with comparable quality of care.","output":"Task shifting in primary care to tackle healthcare worker shortages: An umbrella review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore the support and impede factors of entrepreneurial activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. By using the qualitative method, 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with entrepreneurs operating micro-, small- and medium-scale enterprises.

Patients with MIS-C are prone to gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, and shock in addition to atypical KD syndrome with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and/or cardiovascular events. MIS-C manifests KD-like symptoms that alert physicians to early recognize and adopt the KD treatment regimen for patients with MIS-C. MIS-C linked to COVID-19 teaches us infection-associated autoimmune vasculitis and vice versa. Studies on genetic susceptibility have identified certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated with KD and/or COVID-19. Certain HLA subtypes, such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-MICA A4 are associated with KD. HLA-B*46:01 is proposed to be the risk allele of severe COVID-19 infection, and blood group O type is a protective factor of COVID-19. The autoimmune vasculitis of KD, KD shock syndrome (KDSS), or MIS-C is mediated by a genetic variant of HLA, Fc?3R, and/or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) resulting in hyperinflammation with T helper 17 (Th17)/Treg imbalance with augmented Th17/Th1 mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon (IFN?3), and IL-17A, and lower expression of Treg-signaling molecules, FoxP3, and transforming growth factor (TGF-?). There are certain similarities and differences in phenotypes, susceptibility, and pathogenesis of KD, KDSS, and MIS-C, by which a physician can make early protection, prevention, and precision treatment of the diseases. The evolution of immunotherapies for the diseases has shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or combined with corticosteroids is the standard treatment for KD, KDSS, and MIS-C. However, a certain portion of patients who revealed a treatment resistance to IVIG or IVIG plus corticosteroids, posing a need to early identify the immunopathogenesis, to protect hosts with genetic susceptibility, and to combat Th17/Treg imbalance by anti-cytokine or pro-Treg for reversal of the hyperinflammation and IVIG resistance.

We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","output":"Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the relationship of mindfulness with self-efficacy and self-esteem. The study has also investigated the difference in mindfulness levels across five dimensions: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experiences and non-reactivity to inner experience between males and females and between young adults and middle-aged adults who belong to the Indian population. There was a total of 146 participants (F = 80, M = 66), 84 in the young adult group (20C40 years) and 62 participants in the middle adult group (41C65 years). Pearson correlation showed statistically significant (p < 0.01) moderate positive correlation between all the five dimensions of mindfulness and self-esteem; while self-efficacy had significant (p < 0.01) moderate positive correlation with all the dimensions of mindfulness except for non-judging of inner experiences. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with self-esteem as outcome variable showed model fitness of 51% (p < 0.01) with acting with awareness, non-reactivity to inner experience, non-judging of inner experiences and describing as predictive variables. With self-efficacy as outcome variable, MLR showed model fitness of 40% (p < 0.01) with non-reactivity to inner experiences, acting with awareness, observing and describing as predicting variables.

METHODS: About 100 patients with hypertension treated in our hospital from March 2020 to April 2021 were enrolled. All patients were arbitrarily assigned to the control group and the study group. The former group was cured with valsartan, and the latter group was cured with Yiqi Huayu Pinggan Zishen recipe combined with valsartan. The curative effect, blood pressure level, renal function index, serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), angiotensin II (Ang II) level, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score, and the incidence of adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: First of all, we compared the curative effects; the study group exhibited remarkably effective in 44 cases and effective in 6 cases, and the effective rate was 100.00%, while in the control group, 24 cases were markedly effective, 16 cases were effective, and 5 cases were ineffective; the effective rate was 90.00%. The curative effect in the study group was higher (P < 0.05). Secondly, we compared the blood pressure level. Before treatment, there was no remarkable difference (P > 0.05). After treatment, the blood pressure of the two groups decreased. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of the study group were lower (P < 0.05). In terms of renal function indexes, the levels of blood urine nitrogen (BUN), Cr, and  2-MG in the study group were lower, while the level of eGFR in the study group was higher (P < 0.05). The serum levels of MMP-9, MCP-1, and Ang II decreased. Of note, the levels of serum MMP-9, MCP-1, and Ang II in the study group were lower (P < 0.05). After treatment, the TCM syndrome scores decreased, and the study group was lower (P < 0.05). Finally, we compared the incidence of adverse reactions.

Patients and Methods: We included 250 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. RT-PCR was used to detect influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial viruses. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect IgM antibodies for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the serum of patients. Based on these results, we divided the patients into two groups, the simple SARS-CoV-2-infected group and the coinfected SARS-COV-2 group. Coinfected patients were then further categorized as having a coinfection of viral pathogen (CoIV) or coinfection of atypical bacterial pathogen (CoIaB). Results: No statistically significant differences were found in age, gender, the time taken to return negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, length of hospital stays, and mortality between the simple SARS-CoV-2 infection group and the coinfection group. Of the 250 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 39 (15.6%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen in addition to SARS-CoV-2. A third of these pathogens were detected as early as the 1st week after symptom onset and another third were identified after more than three weeks. The most detected CAP pathogen was C. pneumoniae (5.2%), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4.8%), M. pneumoniae (4.4%) and adenovirus (2.8%). Patients coinfected with viral pathogens (CoIV) (n=18) had longer hospital stays when compared to patients coinfected with atypical bacterial pathogens (CoIaB) (n=21). Except for one fatality, the remaining 38 coinfected patients all recovered with favourable outcomes. Conclusion: Coinfections in COVID-19 patients are common.

By using ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively, the presence of extracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA were measured. The levels of intracellular HBV DNA and mRNA were determined by using Southern blot or reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Intracellular distribution of antigen were measured by Western blot. A 1995 mol/L concentration of the commercially-available hepatitis B drug, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), was required to achieve 50% cytotoxicity against cultured cells (CC(50)) by day nine; in contrast, only 1747 mol/L of Compound 1 was required for the same result.

In this study, we tested the efficiency of APs in removing bacterial air contamination in the educational context in the Upper Silesia region of Poland during the cold season of 2018/2019. During the 6 months of measuring microbiological air quality, an 18% decrease in the concentration of microbiological pollutants as a result of the action of the APs was recorded. Additionally, the results of the particle size distribution of the bacterial aerosols showed a reduction in the share of the respirable fraction (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 3.3 m) by an average of 20%. The dominance of gram-positive cocci in the indoor environment indicates that humans are the main source of most of the bacteria present in the building.

Out of 305 COVID-19 positive patients, 70 asymptomatic out-patients were determined as the study group and 70 age and sex-matched healthy adults as the control group. The echocardiographic examination was performed with the Philips IE33 system, and LV-GLS was measured using commercially available software QLAB 9 (cardiac motion quantification; Philips Medical Systems). The absolute value of LV-GLS  18 did deem to be impaired LV-GLS. The absolute value of LV-GLS was statistically significantly lower in the COVID-19 group than in healthy controls (19.17  2.65 vs. 20.07  2.19, p = 0.03). The correlation between having recovered from COVID-19 and impaired LV-GLS (18) did detect with the Pearson correlation test (p = 0.02). Having recovered from COVID-19 was found as a predictor for detecting impaired LV-GLS (18) in the multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 0.133 (0.038C0.461); 95% CI, p = 0.001). This study suggests that COVID-19 may cause subclinical LV dysfunction detected by LV-GLS during early recovery even in a population of patients at low cardiac risk, asymptomatic, and recovered with home quarantine. The study findings indicate that the long-term cardiovascular follow-up of these patients may be more important than thought.","output":"Left ventricular global longitudinal strain in low cardiac risk outpatients who recently recovered from coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Addressing the mental health needs of cancer patients and their caregivers improves the quality of care the patient receives in any cancer care ecosystem. International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. Results: Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. Conclusion: The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID19 pandemic.","output":"Psycho-oncology service provisions for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in an oncology centre in eastern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Cell therapy may become an option for lung injury treatment. However, no data are available on the alveolar presence and time course of CD4+ CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory lymphocyte cells (Tregs) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Accordingly, we (1) measured the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs to all (CD4+) lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of ARDS patients and of control subjects without lung disease and (2) assessed their impact on 30-day mortality. METHODS: In a prospective study, the ratios of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells to all CD4+ cells were measured (FACS) within 24 h of the patients ICU referral in the BAL and in the blood of 47 patients with ARDS (32 males, 15 females; mean age 44 years 13) as well as in 8 controls undergoing elective abdominal surgery (5 men, 3 women; mean age 49 years 4). BAL concentrations of several cytokines were also measured in ARDS patients. RESULTS: Tregs were detected in the BAL of control subjects and ARDS patients. However, the mean ratio of Tregs to all CD4+ lymphocytes was threefold greater in ARDS non-survivors (16.5 %; p = 0.025) and almost twofold greater in ARDS survivors (9.0 %; p = 0.015) compared to controls (5.9 %). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory lymphocytes to all CD4+ lymphocytes in the BAL to be an important and independent prognostic factor for 30-day survival (HR 6.5; 95 % CI, 1.7C25; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: An increased T-regulatory cell ratio in the admission BAL of patients with ARDS is an important and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality.","output":"An increased alveolar CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cell ratio in acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with increased 30-day mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early warning indicators based on critical slowing down have been suggested as a model-independent and low-cost tool to anticipate the (re)emergence of infectious diseases. We studied whether such indicators could reliably have anticipated the second COVID-19 wave in European countries. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we found that characteristic early warning indicators generally decreased rather than increased prior to the second wave. A model explains this unexpected finding as a result of transient dynamics and the multiple time scales of relaxation during a non-stationary epidemic. Particularly, if an epidemic that seems initially contained after a first wave does not fully settle to its new quasi-equilibrium prior to changing circumstances or conditions that force a second wave, then indicators will show a decreasing rather than an increasing trend as a result of the persistent transient trajectory of the first wave. Our simulations show that this lack of time scale separation was to be expected during the second European epidemic wave of COVID-19. Overall, our results emphasize that the theory of critical slowing down applies only when the external forcing of the system across a critical point is slow relative to the internal system dynamics.","output":"Overlapping Time Scales Obscure Early Warning Signals for the Second COVID-19 Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: .

Service planning and policy making for recovery from the pandemic and beyond should draw not only on COVID-19 experiences, but also on the substantial research evidence accumulated prior to this. Aims: to conduct an umbrella review of systematic reviews of research literature and evidence-based guidance on remote working in mental health, including both qualitative and quantitative literature. Method: Three databases were searched between January 2010 and August 2020 for systematic reviews meeting pre-defined criteria. Reviews retrieved were independently screened and those meeting inclusion criteria were synthesised and assessed for risk of bias. Narrative synthesis was used to report findings Results: Nineteen systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Fifteen examined clinical effectiveness, eight reported on aspects of tele-mental health implementation, ten reported on acceptability to service users and clinicians, two on cost-effectiveness and one on guidance. Most reviews were assessed as low quality. Findings suggested that video-based communication could be as effective and acceptable as face-face formats, at least in the short-term. Evidence was lacking on extent of digital exclusion and how it can be overcome, or on significant context such as children and young people and inpatient settings. Conclusions: This umbrella review suggests that tele-mental health has potential to be an effective and acceptable form of service delivery. However, we found limited evidence on impacts of large-scale implementation across catchment areas.

This paper examines effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We investigate the effects of two key elements in mass vaccination, which are allocations and timing of first and second doses and types of vaccines, on the spread of COVID-19. Amid limited supply of approved vaccines and constrained medical resources, the choice of a vaccination strategy is fundamentally an economic problem. We employ standard time-series and panel data models commonly used in economic research with real world data to estimate the effects of progress in vaccination and types of vaccines on health outcomes. Potential confounders such as government responses and people's behavioral changes are also taken into account. Our findings suggest that the share of people vaccinated with at least one dose is significantly negatively associated with new infections and deaths. Conditioning on first dose progress, full vaccination offers no further reductions in new cases and deaths. For vaccines from China, however, we find weaker effects of vaccination progress on health outcomes. Our results support the extending interval between first and second dose policy adopted by Canada and the UK among others for mRNA-based vaccines. As vaccination progressed, people's mobility increased and it offset the direct effects of vaccination. Therefore, public health measures are still important to contain the transmission by refraining people from being more mobile after vaccinated.","output":"Vaccination strategies and transmission of COVID-19: evidence across leading countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease, COVID-19, has infected over seven million people world-wide, including two million people in the United States. While many people recover from the virus uneventfully, a subset of patients will require hospital admission, some with intensive care needs including intubation, and mechanical ventilation. To date there is no cure and no vaccine is available. Passive immunotherapy by the transfusion of convalescent plasma donated by COVID-19 recovered patients might be an effective option to combat the virus, especially if used early in the course of disease. Here we report our experience of using convalescent plasma at a tertiary care center in a mid-size, midwestern city that did not experience an overwhelming patient surge. Methods Hospitalized COVID-19 patients categorized as having Severe or Life-Threatening disease according to the Mayo Clinic Emergency Access Protocol were screened, consented, and treated with convalescent plasma collected from local donors recovered from COVID-19 infection. Clinical data and outcomes were collected retrospectively. Results 31 patients were treated, 16 severe patients and 15 life-threatened patients. Overall mortality was 27% (4/31) but only patients with life-threatening disease died. 94% of transfused patients with severe disease avoided escalation to ICU care and mechanical ventilation. 67% of patients with life-threatening disease were able to be extubated. Most transfused patients had a rapid decrease in their respiratory support requirements on or about day 7 following convalescent plasma transfusion. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that convalescent plasma is associated with reducing ventilatory requirements in patients with both severe and life-threatening disease, but appears to be most beneficial when administered early in the course of disease when patients meet the criteria for severe illness.","output":"Hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with Convalescent Plasma in a mid-size city in the midwest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article compares and contrasts Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden Jr to Republican President Donald Trump, examining their family backgrounds, childhoods, defense mechanisms, careers, life traumas, styles of leadership, and values Both are tall, standing at six-foot and six- foot-two or three respectively, although Biden is slender and Trump is now considered \\"obese\\" based on his body mass index 3 Both are, in Biden's words, \\"seduced by real estate The Democrat has a lifelong commitment to civil rights, advocacy of democracy abroad, and led the way for legislation protecting women's rights while the Republican uses racism when it serves his purposes and sexualizes women to an unusual degree While neither attended public school, Joey had to do yard work, weeding the school's garden and washing its windows in the summer to help pay for the Archmere Academy parochial high school he aspired to attend 8 Regarding the coronavirus, Trump keeps pushing for the economy and education to reopen whereas Biden more prudently follows the more cautious advice of medical experts","output":"A Psychobiographical and Psycho-Political Investigation of Biden and Trump in Troubled T imes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Certain nutrient supplements (nutraceuticals) may target neurobiological pathways perturbed in bipolar disorder (BD) such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Search terms for BD, nutraceuticals, and clinical trials (total search terms = 75) were used to search from inception to February 20, 2020. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS A total of 1,712 studies were identified through the search.

QT prolongation is usually related to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel inhibitory activity of most drugs. In this research, molecular docking was used to study the potential inhibitory activities of HCQ as well as other quinolines derivatives and hERG potassium channel protein.

We included PLHIV from the timepoint when they were first eligible, though not necessarily referred, for community ART within CCMDD and followed them for 18 months. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare 12\\\\month attrition and viraemia between clients referred for community ART and those remaining in clinic care. RESULTS: Among 209,744 PLHIV aged  18 years who collected ART between October 2016 and December 2018, 7511 (3.6%) received second\\\\line ART. Of these, 2575 (34.3%) were eligible for community ART.

PDCoV was subsequently identified in the USA in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. The virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. Following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of PDCoV, it is now possible to address questions regarding virusChost cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. Here, we presented a detailed study of PDCoV-induced replication organelles. All positive-strand RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral RNA synthesis, forming the replication organelle. Replication organelles for the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. All coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). In addition, Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while Gammacoronaviruses induce the formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with tethered double-membrane spherules. However, the structures induced by Deltacoronaviruses, particularly the presence of convoluted membranes or double-membrane spherules, are unknown. Initially, the dynamics of PDCoV strain OH-FD22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and progeny particle release determined. Subsequently, virus-induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. As has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, PDCoV replication was found to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles. Significantly, however, PDCoV replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum, small associated tethered vesicles, and double-membrane spherules. These structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.","output":"The Porcine Deltacoronavirus Replication Organelle Comprises Double-Membrane Vesicles and Zippered Endoplasmic Reticulum with Double-Membrane Spherules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is a nucleoside antiviral recently studied in several randomized trials for treatment of COVID-19.

Findings: Three principles are proposed to assist in mitigating the impacts of disaster on the tourist industry. These principles also serve as a means of potentially re-orienting and guiding the tourism and hospitality industries toward a sustainable and equitable future. Originality/value: In addition to the three guiding principles offered in this paper;the examination of COVID-19 offers a novel case in which tourism is impacted globally by a singular disaster.

Located at an equivalent altitude of approximately 3,800 m asl, the Concordia Station in Antarctica represents an opportunity to study the course of human adaption to mild hypoxia with reduced impact of potentially disturbing variables else than oxygen deprivation. We recruited seven healthy subjects who spent 10 months in the Concordia Station, and collected plasma samples at sea level before departure, and 90 days, 6 months, and 10 months during hypoxia. Samples were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry to unravel how the non-polar and polar metabolomes are affected. Statistical analyses were performed by clustering the subjects into four groups according to the duration of hypoxia exposure. The non-polar metabolome revealed a modest decrease in the concentration of all the major lipid classes. By contrast, the polar metabolome showed marked alterations in several metabolic pathways, especially those related to amino acids metabolism, with a particular concern of arginine, glutamine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Remarkably, all the changes were evident since the first time point and remained unaffected by hypoxia duration (with the exception of a slight return of the non-polar metabolome after 6 months), highlighting a relative inability of the body to compensate them. Finally, we identified a few metabolic pathways that emerged as the main targets of chronic hypoxia.","output":"Inside the Alterations of Circulating Metabolome in Antarctica: The Adaptation to Chronic Hypoxia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Of the many impacts of COVID\\\\19 on contemporary healthcare is the rapid and overwhelming shift to remote telehealth (TH) service. The precise effect of TH on treatment is yet unknown, and the possible child/adult differences are an essential point of clarification for the utility of TH services and efforts to improve upon them. METHODS: The current study considers data reflecting pre\\\\, during\\\\, and post\\\\COVID\\\\19 lockdown over the first six months of 2020. Data comprise records of N = 43,294 services delivered to N = 2520 unique clients across multiple outpatient mental health sites at a Certified Community Based Mental Health Clinic (CCBHC) in Rockland County, NY, an area hard hit by COVID\\\\19. RESULTS: Results demonstrate significant differences between child and adult sessions with a relative decrease in the number of child mental health services with the switch to TH in March 2020 (onset of lockdown) and a relatively rapid shift back to face\\\\to\\\\face among child services when in\\\\person services resumed in May and June 2020. Results further highlight significant differences between child age and service type, with psychiatry less affected by TH than psychotherapy.

DESIGN: Spatial mapping, generalised linear models, using time as a factor and spatial-lag models were used to explore the relationship between self-reported COVID-19 symptom prevalence as recorded through two smartphone symptom tracker apps and a range of socioeconomic factors using a repeated cross-sectional study design. SETTING: In the community in Northern Ireland, UK. The analysis period included the earliest stages of non-pharmaceutical interventions and societal restrictions or lockdown in 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Users of two smartphone symptom tracker apps recording self-reported health information who recorded their location as Northern Ireland, UK. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Population standardised self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and correlation between population standardised self-reported COVID-19 symptoms and area-level characteristics from measures of multiple deprivation including employment levels and population housing density, derived as the mean number of residents per household for each census super output area. RESULTS: Higher self-reported prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms was associated with the most deprived areas (p<0.001) and with those areas with the lowest employment levels (p<0.001). Higher rates of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms within the age groups, 18C24 and 25C34 years were found within the most deprived areas during the earliest stages of non-pharmaceutical interventions and societal restrictions (lockdown). CONCLUSIONS: Through spatial regression of self-reporting COVID-19 smartphone data in the community, this research shows how a lens of social deprivation can deepen our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and prevention.

Peritonectomy and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy added options for surgical treatment of this condition beyond palliative surgery. The most favorable outcomes are recorded when peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer can be resected to no visible evidence of disease. Methods To determine if any benefit from surgical treatment of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases can occur from incomplete resection of peritoneal metastases, we studied patients by the completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score. The CC-3 indicated a palliative resection, CC-2 gross residual disease, and CC-1 almost complete cytoreduction but visible residual disease. The impact of clinical-, pathologic-, and treatment-related variables on the survival of the three groups was compared. Results Eighty-five patients with long-term follow-up were available for study. The median age was 53 years (range 18-82). There were 60 males (70.6%). Symptomatic patients, those with bowel obstruction, and patients with positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes had significantly reduced survival. The median survival of the CC-3, CC-2, and CC-1 groups were significantly different (p = 0.0027). The 2-year or greater survivals of the three groups were 4.8%, 15.1%, and 38.7%, respectively.

METHODS: Fity-five COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 23rd to March 31st, 2020 as the research object. The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-&#945;, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23109/L to 0.57109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to IFN, gamma globulin, antiserum and MSC transplantation therapy can help clear the virus and reduce inflammation. Although MSC transplantation fail to completely change the immunecompromised state of critically ill patients, it controlled the progression of inflammation in the liver and kidneys.","output":"[Evaluation of the effects of immunotherapy and mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in the treatment of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Students completing an introductory physical geography course used an interactive geovisualizations [iGEO] lab exercise centered around lightning in northern Arizona to investigate atmospheric processes This iGEO looks and plays like a conventional videogame where the student controls an avatar in a 3D environment This iGEO was inspired by moving the introductory physical geography courses online due to the ongoing university closures to on-the-ground classes related the COVID-19 pandemic The goal of an iGEO rests in increasing motivation and encouraging active, engaged learning for students, many of whom are taking the course for required college credit Most students expressed positive experiences with the new iGEO;the determining factors related to this experience centered around enjoyment, usability, and simplicity of the game There was also a difference in student experience based on student academic majors Students of non-geographic or science backgrounds had a lower experience rating than those who did have a geographic or science background Overall, students preferred the iGEO lab over traditional lab coursework This research led to a refined iGEO lab for lightning in northern Arizona and it was made available to all interested faculty via a public website, along with three other iGEO-based labs RIGEO","output":"Interactive Geovisualizations (iGEO): A New Approach to Teaching and Learning Physical Geography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Natural Language (NL) applications, there is often a mismatch between what the NL interface is capable of interpreting and what a lay user knows how to express.

Genomic RNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a recombinant viral protein coat were used as control materials and compared for recovery from nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: Nucleic acid extraction showed decreased recovery of endemic Coronavirus in vitro transcribed RNA (NL63) compared with attenuated virus (OC43). SARS-CoV-2 RNA had more reliable recovery from extraction through amplification than genomic RNA. Recovery of genomic RNA was improved by combining lysis buffer with clinical matrix before adding RNA. The RT-PCR assay demonstrated 100% in silico sensitivity and specificity.

RESULTS 137 patients were included. 96 underwent home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), median age 5.5 years. 41 had oxycapnography (O2/CO2), median age 5 years. 56% HRP and 83% O2/CO2 were successful. A diagnosis of autism predicted a lower success rate (29%) as did age under 5 years. CONCLUSION Switching studies rapidly from an inpatient to a home environment is possible, but there are several challenges that include a higher failure rate in younger children and those with neurodevelopmental disorders.","output":"Feasibility and parental perception of home sleep studies during COVID-19: a tertiary sleep centre experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health crisis. Considering the recent food and drug administration (FDA) approval of remdesivir as the first officially approved agent for COVID-19 treatment, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir administration in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was done through MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from their inception to December 22nd, 2020. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five non-randomized studies of intervention (NRSI) were entered into the meta-analysis. The results showed that remdesivir administration was associated with a significant improvement in the 28-day recovery (RR = 1.09, 95%CI, 1.04-1.15), low flow oxygen support through days one to 14 (RR = 2.88, 95%CI, 1.80-4.60), and invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement through days 14-28 of the follow-up time (RR = 5.34, 95%CI, 2.37-12.05). The risk of experiencing serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was significantly lower (RR = 0.75, 95%CI, 0.63-0.90) in the remdesivir group than the comparison/control group. The pooled median difference of the time to clinical improvement was 2.99 (95%CI = 2.71-3.28), which did not remain significant during the sensitivity analysis. The clinical output comparison of the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir courses revealed that the 5-day regimen might provide similar benefits while causing fewer serious ADRs than 10-day. The current meta-analysis provided an updated evaluation of scientific evidence on the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients. Performing adequate well-designed RCTs are needed to show more accurate results.","output":"Remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19; an updated systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I am deeply honored and humbled to serve as the 2022 president of the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S).

Posteriorly, an enquiry was made about the perception of impact of this training, through a descriptive and inferential analysis with the use of a questionnaire designed ad hoc. Results indicated an increase in training associated with institutional digital tools, online evaluation, and design of online courses. The efforts by the professors to implement the knowledge acquired is underlined, with a higher perception of impact observed in the areas of Social and Legal Sciences and Arts and Humanities. In addition, the main difficulties perceived were the lack of time for adapting their practice of teaching with the knowledge acquired, as well as the complexity of performing an online evaluation.

Vaccine acceptance depends upon social norms and human behavior. These organizations conducted the global survey in over 60 countries with a sample size of 437,236 responses. The international survey was organized using a pre-registered randomized experiment demonstrating the role of technology in reaching out to people based in diverse communities and evaluating their beliefs, behavior, and social norms. The study shows that vaccine acceptance can vary due to descriptive norms. All the respondents in the study were adults with access to the internet. Moreover, a large proportion of the population thinks that the COVID-19 pandemic is a viable threat to the community and preventive measures need to be taken including vaccination drives to eradicate the menace. The survey consisted of five blocks involving questions related to healthcare, demographics, vaccines, knowledge, and information exposure. Sampling and weighting were done using a pool of 3,000 respondents over two weeks, and weights were provided per respondent to represent the target population as a whole.

Previous loads and timings along with weather features are often used in literature as input features in load forecasting, but these may be insufficient during COVID-19. As a result, this paper proposes an analytical framework to assess the impact of COVID-19 on power system operation as well as day-ahead electricity prices in Ireland. To improve peak demand forecasting during pandemics, we incorporate mobility, NPIs, and COVID-19 cases as complementary input features and representative of human behaviour changes. By defining different combinations of these explanatory features, several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied and their performance is compared with the baseline scenario currently used in the literature. Using SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we interpret the best performing model, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, to determine the influence of each feature on the predicted outcomes. We discover that typical load forecasting features still influence ML outcomes the most, but mobility-related changes are also significant. Our finding shows that NPIs impact human behaviour and electricity consumption during times of crisis and can be used in the context of load forecasting to assist policymakers and energy distributors.

A potentially single ORF, designated ORF3 according to the pattern of the viral subgenomic mRNAs, could be identified between the S and sM genes. A striking variability, essentially generated by short deletions clustered in a few loci, was observed in the ORF3 of both isolates. The largest predicted polypeptide of 223 amino acids showed homology with polypeptides potentially encoded by other members of the same genetic subset, including two shorter polypeptides of human respiratory virus HCV 229E and one of transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV.

RESULTS: We identified 700 scientific papers and letters and 47 full texts were studied in detail. Children accounted for a small fraction of COVID-19 cases and mostly had social contacts with peers or parents, rather than older people at risk of severe disease. Data on viral loads were scarce, but indicated that children may have lower levels than adults, partly because they often have fewer symptoms, and this should decrease the transmission risk. Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks. However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.

Sociodemographic data, working, and medical history were assessed. The decayed, missing, and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) index was examined. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with dental status with a significance level of 5%. The overall mean DMFT score was 8.365.64. The mean DMFT, missing teeth (MT), and filled teeth (FT) were significantly higher in workers who did not have any direct contact with waste (p0.04).

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in July 2017. Analyses were conducted using Revman 5.3 and Stata 15.0. A total of 91 publications containing 104 studies were eligible (n = 9958 participants), including 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 57 observational studies. Forty-eight studies examined neuropathic pain, 7 studies examined fibromyalgia, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, and 48 other CNCP (13 multiple sclerosis-related pain, 6 visceral pain, and 29 samples with mixed or undefined CNCP). Across RCTs, pooled event rates (PERs) for 30% reduction in pain were 29.0% (cannabinoids) vs 25.9% (placebo); significant effect for cannabinoids was found; number needed to treat to benefit was 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15-61); for 50% reduction in pain, PERs were 18.2% vs 14.4%; no significant difference was observed. Pooled change in pain intensity (standardised mean difference: -0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.08) was equivalent to a 3 mm reduction on a 100 mm visual analogue scale greater than placebo groups. In RCTs, PERs for all-cause adverse events were 81.2% vs 66.2%; number needed to treat to harm: 6 (95% CI 5-8). There were no significant impacts on physical or emotional functioning, and low-quality evidence of improved sleep and patient global impression of change. Evidence for effectiveness of cannabinoids in CNCP is limited. Effects suggest that number needed to treat to benefit is high, and number needed to treat to harm is low, with limited impact on other domains. It seems unlikely that cannabinoids are highly effective medicines for CNCP.","output":"Cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of people with chronic noncancer pain conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled and observational studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease is mainly due to a dysregulated host response related to the overexpression of inflammatory markers. Until recently, only remdesivir had gained FDA approval for COVID-19 hospitalized patients and there are currently no evidence-based therapeutic options or options for prevention of complications that have been established. Some medical treatments such as antivirals, antibacterials, antithrombotics, antipyretics, corticosteroids, interleukin inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, immunostimulants, and vitamin supplements have been utilized. However, there are limited data to support their effectiveness. Hence, this study was attempted to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of antibacterials and antivirals used for COVID-19 using a retrospective cross-sectional approach based on the medical records of adult patients in four hospitals. The number of antibacterials was calculated in defined daily dose (er 100 bed-days unit. Both mixed-logit regression and analysis of covariance were used to determine the effectiveness of the aforementioned agents in relation to COVID-19 outcome and patients length of stay. The model was weighed accordingly and covariates (e.g., age) were considered in the model. Heart disease was found to be the most common pre-existing condition of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in this study. Azithromycin, an antibacterial in the Watch category list, was used extensively (33C65  pe00 bed-days). Oseltamivir, an antiviral approved by the FDA for influenza was the most prescribed antiviral. In addition, favipiravir was found to be a significant factor in improving patients COVID-19 outcomes and decreasing their length of stay. This study strongly suggests that COVID-19 patients received polypharmacy for their treatment. However, most of the drugs used did not reach statistical significance in improving the patients condition or decreasing the length of stay.

However, the trend of non-COVID-19 pneumonia in adult people remains uncertain. Our aim is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of the non-COVID-19 pneumonia in adult people and understand whether the substantial decrease in pneumonia cases is the same as the decline in the incidence of respiratory viral disease activity. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients presenting with pneumonia from January 2019 to December 2020. Details on all the demographics of the patient of pneumonia, hospital course details, prior admission history within 3 months, respiratory culture, and antibiotics sensitivity test were also obtained. Results: The number of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in 2020 was lower than that in 2019, which decreased by 74 patients in 2020. The decreasing number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia between 2019 and 2020 was from ?13.9% in January to March 2020 to ?39.7% in October to December 2020. The decreasing number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia between 2019 and 2020 was from ?14.8% in the youngest cohort to ?28.7% in those aged 85 years. The number of reduced patients with community-acquired pneumonia is greater in late seasons and older age, respectively. The number of adult patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in 2020 was lower than that in 2019, which decreased by 23 patients in 2020. The decreasing number of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia between 2019 and 2020 was from ?20.0% in January to March 2020 to ?52.4% in October to December 2020.

The use of social media by public health authorities has helped to reduce these threats by increasing effective risk communication between the government and the public. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal how Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses social media to improve three aspects of health communication between the government and the public: adoption, operation, and interaction. METHODS: To analyze the 134 CDC government Weibo accounts at the provincial- and prefecture-level administration regions in mainland China, we collected their account data and extracted 1215 Weibo tweets. We also supplemented the data to reveal the overall performance of the CDCs government Weibo use during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: The registration rate of the CDCs government Weibo accounts increased year by year, and the local authorities registered Weibo accounts before the central government authorities. In total, 29.8% (n=134) of the 450 CDC facilities have registered an account. Among the 134 CDC facilities that have registered Weibo accounts, the registration rate in the eastern region (n=68, 50.7%) was higher than those in the central region (n=30, 22.4%) and the western region (n=36, 26.9%). Nearly 90.0% of these Weibo accounts had official certification, but there were dropouts in the specific operating process. One-third of the accounts have not been updated for more than 1 year, and the number of Weibo followers was polarized, with a maximum and minimum difference of 1 million. The response rate to users comments was less than 1%. Emergency information, multimedia content, and original content were more helpful in promoting communication between the government and the public. Such interaction was partially improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC updated the daily epidemic situation and provided popular science information for epidemic prevention and control for the public in a timely manner. CONCLUSIONS: Chinas CDC is using more social media to popularize daily health information and has taken the first step to improve communication between the government and the public. However, equal dialogue, two-way interactions, and effective communication with the public still need improvement.","output":"Social Media Use for Health Communication by the CDC in Mainland China: National Survey Study 2009-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOC) are metabolic products and by-products of bacteria and fungi.

Public health emergencies may generate a range of unforeseen potential stressors for vulnerable individuals and communities. The current pandemic has apparently led to an increase in psychiatric symptoms among these students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Portuguese and Swiss higher-education students. METHODS: This project will use a mixed methods sequential explanatory design in Portugal and Switzerland, with two consecutive phases. During Phase I, a quantitative study will assess the psychological responses of higher-education students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A convenience sampling method will be used for collecting information from students. The association between variables will be determined with univariable and multivariable analyses. During Phase II, qualitative data will be collected in order to understand the determinants of psychological stress and the strategies adopted by students as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify their opinions and feelings about the teaching-learning process during quarantine. In this phase, participants will be selected using a maximum-variation sampling method. Data from focus group discussions will be coded and inductively analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Finally, quantitative and qualitative results will be merged during interpretation to provide complementary perspectives.

Methods Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (>13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated and population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2,465) and 28% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with <13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with >13% black residents. Conclusions Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally.

This finding may indicate that structural changes promoted by iron binding may play a key role in the intracellular traffic of bLf. Altogether, our data improve the comprehension of bLf stability and uptake, adding knowledge to its potential use as a biopharmaceutical.","output":"Influence of iron binding in the structural stability and cellular internalization of bovine lactoferrin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Almost 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will require a proctocolectomy with ileal pouchCanal anastomosis (IPAA) as a result of fulminant colitis, dysplasia, cancer, or medical refractory diseases. Around 50% will experience pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition involving the ileal reservoir, responsible for digestive symptoms, deterioration in quality of life, and disability. Though the majority of initial cases of pouchitis are easily managed with a short course of antibiotics, in about 10% of cases, inflammation of the pouch becomes chronic with very few treatments available. Previous studies have suggested that manipulating the composition of intestinal flora through antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics achieved significant results for treating acute episodes of UC-associated pouchitis. However, there is currently no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a novel therapy involving the transfer of normal intestinal flora from a healthy donor to a patient with a medical condition potentially caused by the disrupted homeostasis of intestinal microbiota or dysbiosis. METHODS: Our project aims to compare the delay of relapse of chronic recurrent pouchitis after FMT versus sham transplantation. Forty-two patients with active recurrent pouchitis after having undergone an IPAA for UC will be enrolled at 12 French centers. The patients who respond to antibiotherapy will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either FMT or sham transplantation. DISCUSSION: On April 30, 2014, the World Health Organization published an alarming report on antibiotic resistance. Finding an alternative medical treatment to antibiotics in order to prevent relapses of pouchitis is therefore becoming increasingly important given the risk posed by multiresistant bacteria. Moreover, if the results of this study are conclusive, FMT, which is less expensive than biologics, could become a routine treatment in the future.

Many children faced milestones such as transition to secondary school having missed several months of face-to-face schooling in the previous academic years. METHODS: This paper examines change in mental health difficulties, life satisfaction, school connectedness, and feelings about transition to secondary school among 10C11-year-olds in Wales, UK, using data from repeat cross-sectional surveys before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 4032 10C11-year-old schoolchildren. The first cohort completed a school-based survey in 2019 (prior to introduction of social distancing measures), and the second in 2021 (following full return to school after two rounds of school closure). RESULTS: The percentage of children reporting elevated emotional difficulties rose from 17% in 2019 to 27% in 2021 (Odds Ratio = 1.65; 95%CI = 1.23 to 2.20). There was no evidence of increased behavioural difficulties (OR = 1.04; 95%CI = 0.73 to 1.46). There was a tendency toward declines in life satisfaction in all analyses, but this intersected the null (OR = 0.86; 95%CI = 0.70 to 1.07). Children reported a high degree of school connectedness before and after the pandemic, with no evidence of change in ratings of teacher relationships, pupil relationships or pupil involvement in school life. There was no evidence of impacts of the pandemic on childrens feelings about the transition to secondary school, with feelings becoming more positive as transition neared. Most findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting childrens emotional recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health priority requiring urgent and effective action at multiple levels of society. Maintaining connectedness to school through the pandemic may have played a role in preventing a steeper increase in child mental health difficulties.

It is evidenced that patients with malignancies, including prostate cancer (PC), may be highly vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, there are no existing drugs that can cure PC and COVID-19. Luteolin can potentially be employed for COVID-19 treatment and serve as a potent anticancer agent. Our present study was conducted to discover the possible drug target and curative mechanism of luteolin to serve as treatment for PC and COVID-19. The differential gene expression of PC cases was determined via RNA sequencing. The application of network pharmacology and molecular docking aimed to exhibit the drug targets and pharmacological mechanisms of luteolin. In this study, we found the top 20 up- and downregulated gene expressions in PC patients. Enrichment data demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, where improvement of metabolism and enhancement of immunity were the main functions and mechanism of luteolin in treating PC and COVID-19, characterized by associated signaling pathways. Additional core drug targets, including MPO and FOS genes, were computationally identified accordingly.

Madagascars status as a least developed country, coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012-2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascars Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 hours of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unauthorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroachment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities. Highlights Distant water fishing nations dominated fishing efforts within Madagascars EEZ. Longlining by foreign nations was the dominant fishing mode and increased from October-February. Malagasy vessels focused on trawling for shrimp. Fishing effort increased during positive Indian Ocean Dipoles and with higher fish prices. Distant water fishing nations frequently fished close to shore and sometimes within MPAs.","output":"Distant water industrial fishing in developing countries: A case study of Madagascar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research shows a nonlinear dependency between hair cortisol concentrations and perceived stress levels. This may be due to stress being targeted at the individual level despite it also being a social phenomenon which is often affected by group dynamics. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the influence of perceived stress on the hair cortisol level, considering the impact of the variables of group dynamics (interpersonal, task, and norm cohesion). Information was collected on 11 groups of, in total, 112 young men in three phases of time during their compulsory military training (covering nine months in total). The classification and regression tree (C&RT) method was used to predict hair cortisol concentrations in groups. The results show that the variability of the hair cortisol level in young men groups can be explained by perceived stress only when the groups were in formation process (47.7% normalised importance in Model 1) and when the groups were working on their final tasks (37.80% normalised importance in Model 3); meanwhile, the importance of perceived stress in explaining hair cortisol concentrations is low when the group is in a routine period of a group life-span (28.9% normalised importance in Model 2). Interpersonal cohesion (normalised importance 100% in Model 1 and 80.0% in Model 3) and task cohesion (normalised importance 78.6% in Model 2) were the most important predictors in the study area.

We created an online survey, which was sent to 273 members of the Polish Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology. The survey contained 51 questions and was divided into main sections: Preparedness, Training, Stress, Reduction, Awareness. A total of 80 responses to the survey were obtained. In Preparedness section the vast majority of respondents (90%) replied, that they used personal protective equipment during the pandemic, however only 50% of the respondents indicated that their facility received a sufficient amount of personal protective equipment. Most of the respondents indicated that the pandemic negatively affected the quality of training of future orthopedists (69.4%) and that pandemic has had a negative impact on their operating skills (66,7%).

Historically, the wait for an autism diagnostic assessment including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) was approximately one year. Following lockdown restrictions on face-to-face assessments, an evidence-informed telehealth assessment protocol was rapidly implemented.ObjectivesDescribe the telehealth implementation process, outcomes and impact on wait list.MethodsWe conducted a literature review of existing autism diagnosis telehealth strategies. Existing members of the autism diagnostic pathway (three community paediatricians, one clinical psychologist and one speech and language therapist-all working part-time) attended formal and informal online telehealth diagnostic courses. New members of the team recruited later in the implementation process went through a similar induction process. Initial implementation was via a pilot phase of 5 children over 6 weeks followed by wider dissemination and staff training to assess 4 children per week. Weekly team meetings were conducted for peer review and service improvement.Data collection/analysis: we collected baseline child data;diagnostic outcomes, and family and clinician satisfaction assessments via formal surveys and informal discussions.ResultsThe telehealth model selected was based on the Tele-ASD-Peds developed in the US targeting young primarily preverbal young children. Assessing clinicians attended freely available online training hosted by the Vanderbilt Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders. Following a pilot phase in May 2020, the programme was launched with 1C2 assessments per week and subsequently expanded to 4 assessments per week with the recruitment of two additional part-time clinicians. As the team gained experience assessing young preverbal children, the offer expanded to include older and more verbal child utilizing other emerging telehealth models ( e.g. Brief Observations of Symptoms of Autism-BOSA). Over the first 10 months of the programme, 60 children ( 38 under 4, 22 over 4) were assessed with diagnostic certainty achieved in the majority of children. The wait list for autism assessment for new referrals into the diagnostic pathway declined from approximately 12 months to approximately 3 months.Satisfaction surveys were collected from a subset of caregivers indicating a high level of satisfaction with the process. Clinicians rated the experience positively on a variety of factors including the ability to observe parents interacting with their children in the home environment. Teachers and school professionals attended some of the sessions facilitating a broader understanding of the childs profile across settings. Three families declined/not offered telehealth assessment due to factors related to home environment or child reluctance to use a screen. Complementing telehealth assessment with live school/nursery observations (when permitted ) confirmed the diagnostic conclusions in 5 children.ConclusionsEarly results suggest teleheath autism diagnostic assessments in a community setting are effective in selected children when directed by highly skilled clinicians. The reduction in wait list time is likely related to the combination of added resources and the availability of a telehealth alternative during the lockdown period. Challenges remain related to sustainability given limited funding resources, assuring equity and overall diagnostic certainty when compared with more traditional assessments.","output":"Implementing a telehealth autism diagnostic service in barnet in response to COVID-19 restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim. To study the myocardial morpho-functional abnormalities, the incidence and nature of cardiac arrhythmias in patients 3 months after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Material and methods. The study included 77 patients (mean age, 35,9 years) treated for coronavirus infection, which underwent echocardiography and 24-hour Holter monitoring 3 months after COVID-19. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1  31 patients with upper respiratory tract involvement;group 2  27 patients with bilateral pneumonia (CT grade 1, 2), 3  19 patients with severe pneumonia (CT grade 3, 4). Statistical processing was carried out using Statistica 10.0. Results. According to echocardiography, the peak tricuspid late diastolic velocity and isovolumetric contraction time in all groups increased (P<0,001). The tricuspid and mitral Em/Am ratio decreased depending on the disease severity. In group 3, the right ventricular and atrial size increased (P<0,001). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure, left atrial volume in patients of the 2nd and 3rd groups was higher than in the control one (P<0,001). In group 1 and 2 patients, the regional strain in basal and basal/middle segments decreased, respectively, while, in group 3, not only regional but also global left ventricular (LV) strain decreased (P<0,001).

The availability and quality of water will be severely affected, and public health threats from the lack of this valuable resource will be great unless water-scarce nations are able to adapt. Saudi Arabia provides a good example of how the climate and unsustainable human activity go hand in hand in creating stress on and depleting water resources, and an example for adaptation and mitigation. METHOD A search of the English literature addressing climate change, water scarcity, human health, and related topics was conducted using online resources and databases accessed through the University at Albany, State University of New York library web page. RESULTS Water scarcity, which encompasses both water availability and water quality, is an important indicator of health. Beyond drinking, water supply is intimately linked to food security, sanitation, and hygiene, which are primary contributors to the global burden of disease. Poor and disadvantaged populations are the ones who will suffer most from the negative effects of climate change on water supply and associated human health issues. Examples of adaptation and mitigation measures that can help reduce the strain on conventional water resources (surface waters and fossil aquifers or groundwater) include desalination, wastewater recycling and reuse, and outsourcing food items or \\"virtual water trade.\\" These are strategies being used by Saudi Arabia, a country that is water poor primarily due to decades of irresponsible irrigation practices. The human and environmental health risks associated with these adaptation measures are examined.

CASE PRESENTATION A 21-year-old male presented with diplopia, dysphagia, and left-sided hemiparesis, dysesthesia, and ataxia. Intracranial imaging showed a heterogeneous mass with a cystic lesion in the pontomedullary junction. Since the tumor caused obstructive hydrocephalus, the patient underwent subtotal tumor resection. A histopathologic evaluation aided a diagnosis of brainstem intraparenchymal schwannoma. Gradual postoperative mass regrowth was recognized. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed on the residual mass and surgical cavity. No tumor regrowth was observed 4 years after surgery. To investigate the genetic background of the tumor, target sequences for 36 genes, including NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1, and microsatellite analysis for loss of 22q did not show any somatic variants or 22q loss.

Methods: We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of longitudinal measures of forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for lung of carbon monoxide (DLco) in individuals diagnosed with IPF from three studies. Suggestively significant variants were investigated further in an additional study. Variants were defined as significantly associated if they had a meta-analysis p<5x10-8, had consistent direction of effects across all studies and were nominally significant (p<0.05) in each study. Findings: 1,048 individuals with measures of longitudinal FVC and 729 individuals with longitudinal measures of DLco passed quality control.

How Twitter content and sentiment has evolved in the early stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 epidemic, has not been described. Objective: To quantify and understand early changes in Twitter activity, content, and sentiment about the COVID-19 epidemic. Design: Observational study. Setting: Twitter platform. Participants: All Twitter users who created or sent a message from January 14th to 28th, 2020. Measurements: We extracted tweets matching hashtags related to COVID-19 and measured frequency of keywords related to infection prevention practices, vaccination, and racial prejudice. We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. Results: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise. The frequency of racially charged tweets closely paralleled the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19.

Accurate and rapid recognition of associated life-threatening conditions is paramount for timely treatment. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to impact the diagnosis of dyspnea presentations in resource-rich settings, and may be of greater diagnostic benefit in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a convenience sample of 100 patients presenting with dyspnea in the Emergency Department at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (UTH-K) in Rwanda. After a traditional history and physical exam, the primary treating team listed their 3 main diagnoses and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1C5). Multi-organ ultrasound scans performed by a separate physician sonographer assessed the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, and evaluated for lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or features of disseminated tuberculosis. The sonographer reviewed the findings with the treating team, who then listed 3 diagnoses post-ultrasound and ranked their confidence accuracy in the leading diagnosis on a Likert scale (1C5). The hospital diagnosis at discharge was used as the standard in determining the accuracy of the pre- and post-ultrasound diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients included in analysis, 57.6% (n = 57) were male, with a mean age of 45 years. Most of them had high-level acuity (54.5%), the dyspnea was of acute onset (45.5%) and they came from district hospitals (50.5%). The most frequent discharge diagnoses were acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (26.3%) and pneumonia (21.2%). Ultrasound changed the leading diagnosis in 66% of cases. The diagnostic accuracy for ADHF increased from 53.8 to 100% (p = 0.0004), from 38 to 85.7% for pneumonia (p = 0.0015), from 14.2 to 85.7% for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (p = 0.0075), respectively, pre and post-ultrasound. The overall physician diagnostic accuracy increased from 34.7 to 88.8% pre and post- ultrasound. The clinician confidence in the leading diagnosis changed from a mean of 3.5 to a mean of 4.7 (Likert scale 0C5) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In dyspneic patients presenting to this Emergency Department, ultrasound frequently changed the leading diagnosis, significantly increased clinicians confidence in the leading diagnoses, and improved diagnostic accuracy.","output":"Impact of ultrasound on management for dyspnea presentations in a Rwandan emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) dominating headlines, highlighting links between the pandemic and biodiversity may increase public awareness of the biodiversity crisis.

DESIGN: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 43 primary care practices from one academic health system (Philadelphia, PA, USA) between April 2019 and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients born between 1945 and 1965 with no history of screening and at least two primary care visits in the two years before the enrollment period. INTERVENTIONS: This multilevel trial was divided into two studies. Substudy A included 1656 eligible patients of 17 primary care clinicians who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a mailed letter about HCV screening (letter only), or a similar letter with a laboratory order for HCV screening (letter+order). Substudy B included the remaining 19 837 eligible patients followed by 417 clinicians. Active electronic patient portal users were randomized 1:5 to receive a mailed letter about HCV screening (letter), or an electronic patient portal message with similar content (patient portal); inactive patient portal users were mailed a letter. In a factorial design, patients in substudy B were also randomized 1:1 to receive standard content (usual care), or content based on principles of social norming, anticipated regret, reciprocity, and commitment (behavioral content). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients who completed HCV testing within four months. RESULTS: 21 303 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Among the 1642 patients in substudy A, 19.2% (95% confidence interval 16.5% to 21.9%) completed screening in the letter only arm and 43.1% (39.7% to 46.4%) in the letter+order arm (P<0.001). Among the 19 661 patients in substudy B, 14.6% (13.9% to 15.3%) completed screening with usual care content and 13.6% (13.0% to 14.3%) with behavioral science content (P=0.06). Among active patient portal users, 17.8% (16.0% to 19.5%) completed screening after receiving a letter and 13.8% (13.1% to 14.5%) after receiving a patient portal message (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Opt out framing and effort reduction by including a signed laboratory order with outreach increased screening for HCV.

Using a triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma models, we found that imuGlue could significantly enhance anti-tumor efficacy by eliciting a robust T cell-mediated immune response while reducing systemic toxicity by preventing the rapid diffusion of anti-PD-L1 drugs into the systemic circulation and other tissues. It was also demonstrated that imuGlue could be successfully utilized for combination therapy with other immunomodulatory drugs to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy, demonstrating its versatility as a new treatment option for cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Harnessing the bioresponsive adhesion of immuno-bioglue for enhanced local immune checkpoint blockade therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses some of the more common gastrointestinal problems encountered in pediatric patients.

Methods: Patients (pts) with pacemakers and defibrillators using CareLink network were offered to participate on up to two home RC sessions. A technician visited the patients home and set up a telehealth tablet and a dedicated programmer with modem card and RC software. These devices were connected via a cellular hot spot to the internet. The investigator had a videoconference interview with the pt and instructed the technician to input a randomized session key number to enable the programmer encrypted communication via a third-party host. At this point the investigator had remote-control of the programmer for usual full device function testing and data assessment. Parameters reprogramming was performed as clinically deemed necessary. In all cases a legend regarding the RC session was programmed in the device information field. A patients feedback questionnaire was recorded. Results: A total of 58 pts were evaluated for a total of 78 RC sessions. Pacemakers: 45 and 14 ICDs (one pt had 2 devices).

The objectives of this audit were to evaluate whether this is achieved in infants <32 weeks gestation or with birth weights <1500g and to look at the impact of gestation on the time from birth to first milk feed.MethodsInclusion criteria were infants born <32 weeks gestation or with a birthweight of <1500g. The length of time from birth to first milk feed in hours (including either colostrum mouth care or first enteral feed) was evaluated on a total of 52 inpatients on the neonatal unit. Data was initially collected in December 2018 on 24 infants. This was followed by interventions including: education of parents and the multidisciplinary team about the importance of the early colostrum administration and collaboration between the neonatal and maternity teams to provide expressing packs to mothers pre-delivery. Further data was then collected on 28 infants in July 2020, all born during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data from 2018 and 2020 were compared and the impact of gestation was analysed by comparing infants born <27 weeks and 27 weeks.ResultsIn 100% of infants in the study the first milk received was human milk (either mothers own milk or donor breast milk) and all infants received their first milk within 96 hours of birth. Overall, 19.2% of infants received their first milk within 6 hours of birth and 63.5% within 24 hours. When comparing the 2018 and 2020 data, a similar percentage of infants received their first milk feed in <24 hours: 62.5% in 2018 and 64.3% in 2020, and at <6 hours: 20.8% in 2018 and 17.9% in 2020. Infants 27 weeks received their first milk feed sooner than infants <27 weeks. In extreme preterm infants <27 weeks, 10% received their first milk feed in <6 hours and 55% in <24 hours. Comparably in preterm infants 27 weeks, 25% received their first milk feed in <6 hours and 68.8% in <24 hours. In both groups, 90% of infants received their first milk feed within 48 hours of birth.ConclusionsThe results in 2018 and 2020 were similar, suggesting that the interventions made during this audit cycle had no observed increase in delivery efficiency of the first milk feed. The second cycle of the audit was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic but even with many restrictions there has been no observed adverse impact on the delivery of the first milk to this group of neonates. Future focus should improve the prompt delivery of the first milk feed for extreme preterm neonates through discussing expressing colostrum with mothers pre-delivery and giving colostrum mouthcare early to these infants.","output":"An audit of the time from birth to first milk feed in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation and of low-birth-weight infants under 1500g"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest contributor to non-communicable disease (NCD) deaths, with hypertension contributing to a significant proportion of these deaths. This study aims to provide estimates of the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension at sub-national levels in India and identifies well and under-performing states with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Methods: The study utilises data from the Longitudinal Study of Ageing in India (LASI), a nationally representative survey of more than 72,000 individuals. Age-sex adjusted prevalence rates of self-reported hypertension was calculated using the direct standardisation method. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association of self-reported hypertension with the various individual co-morbidity, lifestyle, and household factors. Self-reported prevalence was compared with an objective measure of hypertension for each state, and funnel plots were constructed to assess the performance of states. Results: Our findings suggest that the overall prevalence of age-sex adjusted self-reported hypertension was 25.8% in India with significant variation among states. Results based on logistic regression confirm that those individuals who are elderly, obese, belong to a higher socio-economic group and have associated co-morbidities are at increased odds of reporting hypertension. Overall, 4 out of 10 adults over 45 years of age in India are not aware of their hypertensive condition, and of those who are aware, 73% are currently taking medication, and only 10% of these have their hypertension under control. Based on the performance, states were classified into high and low performing categories. States with an increased proportion of population below the poverty line had significantly lower performance with respect to the diagnosis of hypertension, whereas states with higher literacy rates and greater availability of specialist doctors at community health centres (CHCs) had significantly better performance with respect to treatment-seeking behaviour. Conclusion: The findings of this study and its policy implications are discussed. Based on state performance, strategies are proposed in terms selective targeting vs. population-based strategies. High impact states and sub-groups are identified where intense efforts are needed to tackle the growing menace of hypertension in India.","output":"Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypertension Among People Aged 45 Years and Over in India: A Sub-national Analysis of the Variation in Performance of Indian States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to the health care system, particularly affecting the effective delivery of essential health services in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. This study aims to explore community perceptions of COVID-19 and their experiences towards health services utilization during the pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. MethodsThe semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among purposively selected participants (n=41) from a mix of rural and urban settings in all districts (n =8) in Province 2 of Nepal. Virtual interviews were conducted between July and August 2020 in local languages. The data were analyzed using thematic network analysis in NVivo 12 Pro. ResultsThe findings of this research are categorized into four global themes: i) Community and stakeholders perceptions towards COVID-19;ii) Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on health services delivery;iii) Community perceptions and experiences of health services during COVID-19;and, iv) COVID-19: testing, isolation, and quarantine services. Most participants shared their experience of being worried and fearful about COVID-19 and reported a lack of awareness, misinformation, and stigma as major factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Maternity services, immunization, and supply of essential medicine were found to be the most affected areas of health care delivery during the lockdown. Participants reported that the interruptions of health services were mostly due to the closure of health services at local health facilities, limited involvement of private health sectors during the pandemic, fears of COVID-19 transmission among health workers and within health centers, and disruption of transportation services. In addition, the participants expressed frustrations on poor testing, isolation, and quarantine services related to COVID-19, and poor accountability from governments at all levels towards health services management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anecdotal evidence has described atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older adults; however, the frequency of and outcomes associated with delirium in older ED patients with COVID-19 infection have not been well described. Objective: To determine how frequently older adults with COVID-19 present to the ED with delirium and their associated hospital outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 sites in the US. Participants included consecutive older adults with COVID-19 presenting to the ED on or after March 13, 2020. Exposure: COVID-19 was diagnosed by positive nasal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (99% of cases) or classic radiological findings (1% of cases). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was delirium as identified from the medical record according to a validated record review approach. Results: A total of 817 older patients with COVID-19 were included, of whom 386 (47%) were male, 493 (62%) were White, 215 (27%) were Black, and 54 (7%) were Hispanic or Latinx. The mean (SD) age of patients was 77.7 (8.2) years. Of included patients, 226 (28%) had delirium at presentation, and delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms and signs. Among the patients with delirium, 37 (16%) had delirium as a primary symptom and 84 (37%) had no typical COVID-19 symptoms or signs, such as fever or shortness of breath. Factors associated with delirium were age older than 75 years (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.95), living in a nursing home or assisted living (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.55), prior use of psychoactive medication (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.81), vision impairment (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.54-2.54), hearing impairment (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.78-1.55), stroke (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.88), and Parkinson disease (aRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30-2.58).

The increased mortality risk associated with diseases that have underlying endothelial dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), suggests that endothelial (e) nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-derived nitric oxide could be an important defense mechanism. Additionally, intravenous recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently reported as an effective therapy in severe COVID-19, by blocking viral entry, and thus reducing lung injury. Very few studies exist on the prognostic value of endothelium-related protective molecules in severe COVID-19 disease. To this end, serum levels of eNOS, inducible (i) NOS, adrenomedullin (ADM), soluble (s) ACE2 levels, and serum (s) ACE activity were measured on hospital admission in 89 COVID-19 patients, hospitalized either in a ward or ICU, of whom 68 had ARDS, while 21 did not. In our cohort, the COVID-19-ARDS patients had considerably lower eNOS levels compared to the COVID-19 non-ARDS patients. On the other hand, sACE2 was significantly higher in the ARDS patients. iNOS, ADM and sACE activity did not differ. Our results might support the notion of two distinct defense mechanisms in COVID-19-derived ARDS; eNOS-derived nitric oxide could be one of them, while the dramatic rise in sACE2 may also represent an endogenous mechanism involved in severe COVID-19 complications, such as ARDS.

However, chronically elevated cortisol levels also have suppressive effects on immune function. As mounting an immune response is energetically costly, sick individuals may conserve energy by exhibiting certain sickness behaviors, such as declining activity levels. Due to the complex interplay between immune function and sickness behaviors, endocrinological correlates have received growing attention in the medical community, but so far, this subject was investigated rarely. Furthermore, given the complexities of studying illnesses and immunity in natural settings, correlates of sickness behaviors have yet to be studied in non-human primates in the wild. Methods: We measured urinary cortisol levels using liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry in a group of wild habituated chimpanzees in Ta? National Park, C?te d'Ivoire, before, during, and after a respiratory disease outbreak (main causative pathogen: human respiratory syncytial virus A, with coinfections of Streptococcus pneumoniae). Changes in cortisol levels were then related to urinary neopterin levels, a biomarker of immune system activation. Results: Urinary cortisol levels were found to be more than 10-fold higher during the outbreak in comparison with levels before and after the outbreak period. Increasing cortisol levels were also associated with increasing neopterin levels. Interestingly, rather atypical patterns in a diurnal decline of cortisol levels were found during infection periods, such that levels remained raised throughout the day. Conclusion: In conclusion, cortisol increase was related to cellular immune response. Our results suggest that cortisol is a mediator of infectious disease pathogenicity through its impact on the immune system and that wild chimpanzees may be facing energetic stress when sick. By monitoring immune challenges in wild-living animals, our study demonstrates that immune defenses have costs and that these costs are context-specific.","output":"Urinary Cortisol Increases During a Respiratory Outbreak in Wild Chimpanzees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral haemorrhagic feverVHFvirus and a number of other special viruses are considered to cause the worlds most dangerous infections with very high mortality, lack of therapeutic possibilities and often absence of effective vaccines.

The structure of the peptides was characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS), and six beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides were selected as candidate peptides. Subsequently, the effects of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and host cells were identified using virtual screening. According to the results of this in silico analysis, Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALMPHIR) and Ile-Pro-Ala-Val-Phe-Lys (IPAVFK) peptides were evaluated as potential candidates to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 after the future in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Investigation of beta-lactoglobulin derived bioactive peptides against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): in silico analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Digital health, the use of apps, text-messaging, and online interventions, can revolutionize healthcare and make care more equitable. Currently, digital health interventions are often not designed for those who could benefit most and may have unintended consequences. In this paper, we explain how privacy vulnerabilities and power imbalances, including racism and sexism, continue to influence health app design and research. We provide guidelines for researchers to design, report and evaluate digital health studies to maximize social justice in health. METHODS: From September 2020 to April 2021, we held five discussion and brainstorming sessions with researchers, students, and community partners to develop the guide and the key questions. We additionally conducted an informal literature review, invited experts to review our guide, and identified examples from our own digital health study and other studies. RESULTS: We identified five overarching topics with key questions and subquestions to guide researchers in designing or evaluating a digital health research study. The overarching topics are: 1. Equitable distribution; 2. Equitable design; 3. Privacy and data return; 4. Stereotype and bias; 5. Structural racism. CONCLUSION: We provide a guide with five key topics and questions for social justice digital health research. Encouraging researchers and practitioners to ask these questions will help to spark a transformation in digital health toward more equitable and ethical research. Future work needs to determine if the quality of studies can improve when researchers use this guide.","output":"Applying the Digital Health Social Justice Guide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper argues that the best reason for discouraging public debt is that such discouragement acts as a constraint on government spending.","output":"Which public debt should be paid off?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research adopted the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) as theoretical foundation to examine students perceptions regarding Google Drive tools, precisely Google Docs and Sheets and Forms By considering other variables that enriched the model, the study examined nine hypotheses to determine students perceptions and behavioural intentions An online questionnaire was used to collect data from students during the COVID-19 lockdown and the proposed model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) The interest of this research is also motivated by the undeniable popularity of Google Drive, and aims to assist educational initiatives that stimulate the use of e-learning tools in the post-COVID-19 world ? 2020 Association for Computing Machinery","output":"Technological acceptance of Google Drive as E-learning Tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in Wuhan City.

The objective of this study was to examine the associations between food insecurity, multiple chronic conditions, and self-reported health status among a nationally representative sample of older U.S. adults. Data came from the National Poll on Healthy Aging, a national cross-sectional survey conducted in December 2019 among 2,048 individuals aged 50-80 years. Food insecurity was assessed using the six-item short form of the USDA Food Security Survey Module. The primary outcomes of interest were the number of self-reported chronic conditions and self-reported physical health status. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between food security status and the outcomes of interest, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. The overall prevalence of food insecurity among older adults was 14%. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, food insecurity was positively associated with multiple chronic conditions (RRR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08, 2.36, for 2-3 conditions vs. 0-1; RRR 2.59, 95% CI 1.55, 4.33 for 4-10 chronic conditions vs. 0-1).

This study reviewed clinical studies and presents an overview of known and newly analyzed data from children <6 years. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for interventional and non-interventional studies which investigated the effects of EPs 7630 in aRTIs and included children <6 years of age. Sub-group analyses for this age range were performed for symptom scales, global efficacy or effectiveness assessments, and safety outcomes. RESULTS Seven studies with 1067 children <6 years exposed to EPs 7630 were identified. Efficacy of EPs 7630 was significantly superior to placebo in reducing symptom intensity and time until complete recovery in two randomized, double-blind trials in patients with acute bronchitis (AB). Similar symptom time courses were observed in two non-comparative observational studies in AB. One non-comparative, open-label study was identified in acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP), and one in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). In both indications, nearly all children showed complete recovery or major symptom improvements during the treatment period, with changes that were similar to those observed in controlled trials investigating older patient populations. The results were supported by an additional observational study including children with various diagnoses of aRTIs. EPs 7630 was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS EPs 7630 is efficacious in children <6 years suffering from AB. The analyses also support the effectiveness of the product in ATP and in ARS.

Patient was treated by pediatric chemotherapy regimen and then underwent haploidentical stem cell transplantation. Post transplantation, on day+7 he developed SARS-CoV-2 after receiving stem cell graft from a donor who was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 on the day of stem cells harvesting. The case elaborates complications and outcome of a patient receiving stem cell transplant from a donor with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Introduction: COVID-19 disease is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) are a group of patients with special immunocompromised situation and could have potentially devastating outcome if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at increased risk of respiratory viral infections and their associated complications, and their course with COVID-19 disease is expected to be complicated. The patient reported here developed SARS-CoV-2 post HCT who received stem cells from donor diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 by nasopharyngeal swab on the day of the HCT. Conclusion: During this COVID-19 pandemic era, any patient for whom an allogeneic transplant is planned should be tested with nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection especially prior to hospital admission. If the result for SARS-CoV-2 infection proves negative, the transplant procedure should be pursued as planned. Donors with SARS-CoV-2 detected in a respiratory sample are considered ineligible to donate. However, an ineligible donor may be collected in certain situations where delay is not possible or unavoidable. Clinical decision making and teamwork is crucial for patient survival in the COVID-19 pandemic era. This case of an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive recipient stem cell transplantation was pursued as planned from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive stem cell donor with no significant adverse CRS or infection-related outcome in the recipient.","output":"CML-005: Outcome of Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation with a Donor and Recipient with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present studies, we report the cloning and structural characterization of the HFGL2 gene and its functional role in human fulminant hepatitis. The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene, a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical, and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a full-length cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy.

OBJECTIVE The authors compare absorbable barbed sutures (V-Loc, Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) with conventional (smooth) absorbable sutures for soft tissue approximation. METHOD A prospective multicenter randomized study comparing barbed sutures with smooth sutures was undertaken between August 13, 2009, and January 31, 2010, in 241 patients undergoing abdominoplasty, mastopexy, and reduction mammaplasty. Each patient received barbed sutures on 1 side of the body, with deep dermal sutures eliminated or reduced. Smooth sutures with deep dermal and subcuticular closure were used on the other side as a control. The primary endpoint was dermal closure time. Safety was assessed through adverse event reporting through a 12-week follow-up. RESULTS A total of 229 patients were ultimately treated (115 with slow-absorbing polymer and 114 with rapid-absorbing polymer). Mean dermal closure time was significantly quicker with the barbed suture compared with the smooth suture (12.0 vs 19.2 minutes; P<.001), primarily due to the need for fewer deep dermal sutures. The rapid-absorbing barbed suture showed a complication profile equivalent to the smooth suture, while the slow-absorbing barbed suture had a higher incidence of minor suture extrusion. CONCLUSIONS Barbed sutures enabled faster dermal closure quicker than smooth sutures, with a comparable complication profile.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded. Results were compared with findings in blood donors in the Capital Region in the study period. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and April 23, 2020, we screened 29a295 health-care workers, of whom 28a792 (9828%) provided their test results. We identified 1163 (404% [95% CI 382-427]) seropositive health-care workers. Seroprevalence was higher in health-care workers than in blood donors (142 [304%] of 4672; risk ratio [RR] 133 [95% CI 112-158]; p<0001). Seroprevalence was higher in male health-care workers (331 [545%] of 6077) than in female health-care workers (832 [366%] of 22a715; RR 149 [131-168]; p<0001). Frontline health-care workers working in hospitals had a significantly higher seroprevalence (779 [455%] of 16a356) than health-care workers in other settings (384 [329%] of 11a657; RR 138 [122-156]; p<0001). Health-care workers working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (95 [719%] of 1321) had a significantly higher seroprevalence than other frontline health-care workers working in hospitals (696 [435%] of 15a983; RR 165 [134-203]; p<0001). 622 [535%] of 1163 seropositive participants reported symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom that was most strongly associated with seropositivity (377 [3239%] of 1164 participants with this symptom were seropositive vs 786 [284%] of 27a628 without this symptom; RR 1138 [1022-1268]).

However, it is unknown whether a relationship between delta neutrophil index (DNI) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in Stage 3 Grade A patients occurs. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between periodontal disease and DNI and NLR. METHODOLOGY: The study included 74 systemically healthy, non-smoking adults separated into 3 groups. Group 1: 26 subjects with good periodontal health, Group 2: 26 subjects with gingivitis, and Group 3: 22 subjects with Stage 3 Grade A periodontitis. After determining which group the patient will be included in, a clinical periodontal examination was made of each patient and pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index (PI) parameters were measured. Venous blood samples were taken and examined with an automatic hematology analyzer for DNI, immature granulocytes (IG), NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count. RESULTS: DNI, IG, CRP, and neutrophil count were observed to be highest in Group 3, followed by Group 2, and the difference between the groups in these parameters was determined to be statistically significant (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.046, p=0.016). DNI, IG, CRP and neutrophil count were observed to be positively correlated with periodontal parameters.

These regulations aimed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among farmworkers, but made compromises that may fail to reduce the risk of further outbreaks among Oregon's agricultural workers, particularly those living in agricultural labor housing. Instead of considering the scientific literature that called for attention to space and length of time for social distancing among unrelated persons in indoor areas, the agency accepted the 6-foot social distancing rule of thumb and allowed even shorter distances between beds with the installation of plastic or plywood barriers. The 6-foot distance (or less with a barrier) between people sleeping next to each other in poorly ventilated housing has proved disastrous. Additionally, testing for migrant and seasonal farmworkers is neither uniform nor thorough, and little data have been collected to assess the success of existing testing efforts. New regulations must be adopted for farm labor housing that limit occupancy to at most two unrelated individuals for a room of 200 square feet; include expanded specification on the provision of fresh air in shared living spaces; and support increased access to testing, surveillance testing, and alternative safe housing at labor housing sites for identified cases.","output":"Sleeping Within Six Feet: Challenging Oregon's Labor Housing COVID-19 Guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychotherapy relies on a strong integration of theory, empirical research, and clinical experience.

Secondly, we identify many important master regulators [e.g. STAT1/STAT2 and zinc finger (ZNF) proteins], in particular female patients can express more ZNF proteins and stronger transcriptional activities than male patients in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, we discover that ZNF protein activity is significantly negative correlation with the SARS-CoV-2 load of COVID-19 patients, and ZNF proteins as transcription factors can also activate their target genes to participate in anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourthly, we demonstrate that ZNF protein activity is positive correlation with the abundance of multiple immune cells of COVID-19 patients, implying that the highly ZNF protein activity might promote the abundance and the antiviral activity of multiple immune cells to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges in the contexts both of older peoples lives, wellbeing, and health, and also within prison settings, and thus it is timely to reflect on the links between older people, prisons, and cities, at a time of ongoing change. Just as there is an extensive body of ongoing research exploring age-friendly cities and communities, there is extensive published research on older peoples experiences of imprisonment, and a growing body of research on ageing in the prison setting. However, these two research and policy fields have evolved largely independently and separately, leading to a lack of visibility of prisons and prisoners within AFCC research and policy and, similarly, the omission of consideration of the relevance of AFCC research and policy to older prisoners and ex-prisoners. Existing checklists and tools for assessing and measuring the age-friendliness of cities and communities may be of limited relevance in the context of prisons and prisoners.

The analysis of existing knowledge reported here indicates that the roles of urban vegetation on the adverse effect of climate change could not be simply deemed positive or negative, because the role of urban green is also strongly linked to the structure, composition, and distribution of vegetation, as well as to the criteria used for management.

METHODS: We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts.

This study explored parents and childrens views and acceptability of SDF for the management of carious lesions in children. METHODS: Eleven semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 11 parentCchild dyads recruited from patients attending Dundee Dental Hospital and School. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Previous dental experience varied across all child participants. Of the 11 children, five had undergone general anaesthesia (GA) for multiple primary tooth extractions. Two had received SDF treatment. Child participants expressed concerns about being picked on by their peers, if they had discoloured anterior teeth. Younger children appeared less concerned about the discolouration and childs gender did not appear to influence parents decision-making, nor the childs preferences regarding the use of SDF. Parents considered SDF to be particularly useful for anxious or uncooperative children but raised concerns about potential bullying at schools due to the unacceptable dental aesthetics when SDF is applied to anterior teeth. They believed they may be judged by others as neglecting their childs oral health due to the black staining. Both parents and children were more accepting of the SDF when applied to less-visible posterior teeth. Parents accepted the use of SDF if such treatment avoided extractions under GA. CONCLUSION: Despite the unfavourable aesthetics of SDF (black staining), parents appreciated SDF treatment, especially for uncooperative or younger children. However, both parents and children shared concerns about bullying at schools as a consequence of the black staining. Raising awareness about SDF was identified as one approach to encourage the uptake of SDF.

Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks often require private data, for which federated learning is the de-facto approach (i.e., FedNLP). However, our measurements show that FedNLP is prohibitively slow due to the large model sizes and the resultant high network/computation cost. Towards practical FedNLP, we identify as the key building blocks adapters, small bottleneck modules inserted at a variety of model layers. A key challenge is to properly configure the depth and width of adapters, to which the training speed and efficiency is highly sensitive. No silver-bullet configuration exists: the optimal choice varies across downstream NLP tasks, desired model accuracy, and client resources. A silver-bullet configuration does not exist and a non-optimal configuration could significantly slow down the training. To automate adapter configuration, we propose AutoFedNLP, a framework that enhances the existing FedNLP with two novel designs. First, AutoFedNLP progressively upgrades the adapter configuration throughout a training session. Second, AutoFedNLP continuously profiles future adapter configurations by allocating participant devices to trial groups. To minimize client-side computations, AutoFedNLP exploits the fact that a FedNLP client trains on the same samples repeatedly between consecutive changes of adapter configurations, and caches computed activations on clients. Extensive experiments show that AutoFedNLP can reduce FedNLP's model convergence delay to no more than several hours, which is up to 155.5$\\\\times$ faster compared to vanilla FedNLP and 48$\\\\times$ faster compared to strong baselines.","output":"AutoFedNLP: An efficient FedNLP framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prognosis of upcoming crises and the course of actually understanding them is increasingly becoming a major subject of discussions in pursuit of reliable indicators.

OBJECTIVE The objective of our descriptive study was to review our single-center experience with benign salpingo-ovarian conditions (feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes). DESIGN A retrospective cross-sectional study from January-2012 to October-2014. SETTING King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center--a referral tertiary healthcare center. PATIENTS AND METHODS All gynecologic patients who underwent SPLS procedures for benign adnexal pathologies were analyzed for pre-, intra-and postoperative details. SPLS was done using a single multi-port trocar and standard laparoscopic instruments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perioperative complications and conversion rate. RESULTS Eighty (n=80) patients underwent SPLS interventions. the median age and BMi were 37 years and 24.6 kg/m2, respectively. Thirty-one patients (38.8%) had >=1 previous abdominopelvic surgeries. Of 104 SPLS procedures conducted, the three most common procedures were unilateral ovarian cystectomy (n=21/104; 20.2%), bilateral ovarian transposition (n=20/104; 19.2%), and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (n=16/104; 15.4%). No patient required addition of extra ports or conversion to conventional multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. The median operative time, estimated blood loss and hospital stay were 66 min, 10 mL and 1 day, respectively. No patient experienced major intraoperative or postoperative complications. the median postoperative pain grade using the visual analogue scale was 2 (examined in 74 of 80 patients). At six-weeks postoperatively, the median wound scar length (measured at outpatient clinic) was 1.2 cm.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted between June and July 2020. Pregnant women, aged over 18 years were recruited. The survey included closed and open-ended questions to assess womens perceptions and satisfaction with their antenatal care, social support, and stress-reduction strategies. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used for quantitative analyses; qualitative content analysis was used for open-ended questions. FINDINGS: 573 pregnant women completed the survey. Women reported low levels of social support which was predicted by womens mental health and demographic factors and was related to public health and maternity service restrictions. Women reported that restrictions implemented in the maternity services limited their face-to face interactions with healthcare professionals and meant their partners could not attend antenatal appointments or support them in the postpartum period in the maternity setting. The lack of information on COVID-19 and pregnancy meant women had greater uncertainty about pregnancy and birth. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate how the lack of access to antenatal care and reduced perceived social support as a result of the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially intensifies pregnancy specific stress.

It is known that issues such as frustration and inattention, between others, affect student learning. In this fashion, robotics is an important resource that can be used towards helping to solve these issues, empowering our students in order to push their learning up. In this case, robotic tools are generally used considering two different paradigms: as the main focus and as a secondary focus. Actually, these paradigms define the way that Educational Robotics is implemented in schools. Most of the approaches have implemented it as the main focus, which is teaching Robotics. Nevertheless, there are quite a few works that implement robotics as a secondary focus, which is currently assisting the learning process in several disciplines. The main contribution of this work is a complete three steps methodology for Robotics in Education to guide projects in order to either use it alone or to teach robotics with others topics. Our experiments show the importance of devising a study plan and evaluation method because the process is iterative and could improve the final results. As a novelty, here we have joined and extended our previous works by proposing a new set of methods with guidelines and strategies for applying the educational robotics standard curriculum for kids, named EDUROSC-Kids. We propose several tools that have been developed to organize the learning topics of Robotics for children, including the desired outcomes during the learning process. As said our current approach is divided in three steps (or phases): setting up the environment, defining the project, and performing evaluation. The proposed curriculum organizes robotics contents into five disciplines: Robotics and Society, Mechanics, Electronics, Programming, and Control Theory. Also, it considers a set of topics for each discipline and defines the level of knowledge that is recommended to achieve each group of children based on Blooms Nomenclature. The contribution on this paper is a crucial step towards linking the general learning process with Educational Robotics approaches.

Royal jelly could enhance mass insect production as a dietary supplement, but it is costly to produce. The mechanisms underlying the effects of royal jelly on growth remain unclear, and so it is valuable to understand the effects of royal jelly on a mass reared model species to try and augment body size in a more cost-effective manner. To determine the effect of royal jelly on a cricket species (Gryllodes sigillatus) farmed on mass for human consumption, we ran two experiments. In one experiment we tested the dose-dependent response of Gryllodes sigillatus to royal jelly using a range of diets across 0-30% w/w royal jelly. In another experiment we measured the individual-level life history responses of Gryllodes sigillatus to royal jelly over time by individually rearing freshly-hatched Gryllodes sigillatus on two separate diets: half were fed a commercially available cricket diet, while the other half were fed the same diet mixed with 15% w/w fresh royal jelly. Body size and mass measurements were recorded weekly for five weeks. We found the effects of royal jelly to be sex-dependent within crickets: females fed the royal jelly diet grew to be 30% heavier, and this effect was driven by significantly longer abdomens containing 67% more eggs compared to those fed the basal diet. There was a higher probability of crickets reaching adulthood after 35 days when fed royal jelly, and female mass was optimised at approximately 17% w/w royal jelly. Our results reveal that while a royal jelly dietary supplement can increase the yield of mass-reared insects, the life-history responses are species- and sex-specific.","output":"Fruitful female fecundity after feeding Gryllodes sigillatus royal jelly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It was anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic would put a strain on our healthcare system, disproportionately affecting older people. NICE guidance recommended using frailty scoring to support decision making around escalation of care. This study aimed to assess frailty, demographics and COVID-19 infection and to investigate how these related to outcomes of patients aged over 65 years admitted to hospital. METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was carried out by reviewing the electronic health records of all admissions over 65 years. Data points collected included length of stay (LOS), frailty score using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and mortality. Patients were stratified into COVID and non-COVID based on health records and into non-frail (CFS 1C4) and frail (CFS 5C9). RESULTS: A total of 257 patients admitted between 30th March and 30th April 2020 were included in the study (mean age 79 years, 43% female). 141 (54.9%) of patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. 120 patients had CFS 1C4 and 136 has CFS 5C9. 1 patient did not have a frailty score due to insufficient information. 68 (26.8%) of all patients died during the admission. The relative risk (RR) of mortality of patients with coronavirus was 6.3 (95% CI 3.1C12.6, p < 0.0001). The RR of mortality for frail patients compared to the non-frail was 2.1 (95% CI 1.3C3.2, p = 0.002). The median LOS for patients with COVID-19 was 5 days, compared to 4 days for patients who did not have coronavirus. Frailty did not predict longer admission, with median LOS of 5 days for both non-frail and frail patients. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated in this study show that COVID-19 infection and frailty were significantly associated with increased mortality in older patients. This validates the continued use of frailty scoring of older patients on admission to support care planning.","output":"160 The Effect of Frailty and COVID-19 Infection on Clinical Outcomes in Older AdultsA Single Centre Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A year after COVID-19 pandemic has emerged, we have suddenly been forced to adapt to the 'new normal': work-from-home setting, parents home-schooling their children in a new blended learning setting, lockdown and quarantine, and the mandatory wearing of face mask and face shields in public.

While, still the best practical way to prevent the transmission of viruses is to practice self-sanitation and follow social distancing principles, enhancing the individual's immunity through the consumption of proper foods containing balanced nutrients can have significant result against viral infections. Foods containing nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, few polysaccharides, and some non-nutrients (i.e. polyphenols) have shown therapeutic potential against the function of viruses and can increase the immunity of people. SCOPE AND APPROACH: The results of conducted works aiming for studying the potential antiviral characteristics of diverse groups of foods and food's nutrients (in terms of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals) are critically discussed. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: Nutrients, besides playing an important role in maintaining normal physiology of human's body and healthiness, are also required for enhancing the immunity of the body and can be effective against viral infections. They can present antiviral capacity either by entering into the defensive mechanism directly through interfering with the target viruses, or indirectly through activating the cells associated with the adaptive immune system. During the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic (the lack of proper curative viral drug), enhancing the immunity of individual's body through proposing the appropriate diet (rich in both macro and micro-nutrients) is one of few practical preventive measures available in fighting against Coronaviruses, this significant health-threatening virus, as well as other viruses in general.","output":"Role of food nutrients and supplementation in fighting against viral infections and boosting immunity: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the influence of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) for MS on COVID-19 are unknown.

CASE REPRESENTATION: A man in his early 40 s without a smoking history and underlying pulmonary diseases suddenly complained of left chest pain with dyspnea 1 day after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Chest X-ray revealed pneumothorax in the left lung field, and a chest tube was inserted into the intrathoracic space without negative pressure 9 h after the onset of chest pain, resulting in the disappearance of respiratory symptoms; however, 2 h thereafter, dyspnea recurred with lower oxygenation status. Chest X-ray revealed improvement of collapse but extensive infiltration in the expanded lung. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with re-expansion pulmonary edema, and his dyspnea and oxygenation status gradually improved without any intervention, such as steroid administration. Abnormal lung images also gradually improved within several days. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the rare presentation of re-expansion pulmonary edema following pneumothorax drainage in a patient with COVID-19, which recovered without requiring treatment for viral pneumonia.

In the process of adaptation, social-ecological systems resilience at different levels plays a crucial role. Though resilience is acknowledged as multilevel feature, studies on the interaction between the levels while understanding communities responses to shock and stress are limited. Thus, in this study, we explored the shocks and stresses the fishing community faced and their views on the resilience feature at different levels (i.e., individual, household, and community level) in coastal Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic and 65-day fishing ban period. The study found that the most resilience promoting features (e.g., diversified livelihood, friendship, and network of supports) were adopted at the individual and household levels. However, positive and negative interactions were explored between resilience features at all levels. Low community-level resilience was not translated into a lack of household-level resilience, and strong individual-level resilience did not mean high household-level resilience. It was noted that the increased resilience of a particular individual or household could negatively affect community resilience. Resilience features showed inconsistent interactions within or among the three levels resilience features. The study also revealed that multilevel resilience features stressed the importance of combining persistence (i.e., keeping fishing as the main livelihood) and adaptation process (e.g., livelihood diversification). The study showcases the importance of considering multilevel resilience that offers insight into crucial resilience factors which would not be evident if only one level were studied.

We estimated this risk for 5572 municipalities in Brazil using a combination of a multicriteria decision-making approach with spatial analysis to estimate the exceedance risk, and then, we examined the risk variation by designing 5 control intervention scenarios (3 scenarios representing reduction on social contacts, and 2 scenarios representing investment on health care system). For the baseline scenario using an average infection rate across Brazil, we estimated a mean Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) value of -16.73, indicating that, on average, the Brazilian municipalities will have a deficit of approximately 17 beds. This deficit is projected to occur in 3338 municipalities with the north and northeast regions being at the greatest risk of exceeding health care capacity due to the COVID-19. The intervention scenarios indicate across all of Brazil that they could address the bed shortage, with an average of available beds between 23 and 32.

Methods: Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) were collected from the nasal mucosa and incubated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and/or fluticasone propionate (FP), followed by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses. Results: Among the TLR agonists, the TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) significantly increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in HNECs (ACE2 36.21211.600-fold change, p<0.0001; TMPRSS2 5.5982.434-fold change, p=0.031). The ACE2 protein level was also increased with Poly(I:C) stimulation (2.8840.505-fold change, p=0.003). The Poly(I:C)-induced ACE2 expression was suppressed by co-incubation with FP (0.4050.312-fold change, p=0.044). Conclusion: The activation of innate immune signals via TLR3 promotes the expression of genes related to SARS-CoV2 cell entry in the nasal mucosa, although this expression is suppressed in the presence of FP. Further studies are required to evaluate whether FP suppresses SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry.","output":"Fluticasone Propionate Suppresses Poly(I:C)-Induced ACE2 in Primary Human Nasal Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The desire to control Covid 19 pandemic has continued to exist in the Mbala district of Zambia, with the latest trend showing a significant increase in a number of people testing positive, with a corresponding increase in vaccines (AZ, JJ) hesitancy resulting in a low (2.8%) vaccination rate in the district. Thus, the need to probe further on covert factors under acceptability (myths, AEFs) and accessibility (vaccines availability, adequacy of vaccination sites) that could be reducing Covid 19 vaccine uptake in Mbala district. The study used a cross-sectional survey, a mixed (quantitative & qualitative) method in eliciting information from data sources covering a period of six months (April - September 2021).

The S protein is likely the most complicated of all viral glycoproteins and is a key factor in immunological responses and virus pathogenesis. It is also the driving force dictating virus entry mechanisms, which are highly plastic for coronaviruses, allowing a plethora of options for different virus variants and strains in different cell types. Here we review coronavirus entry as a foundation for current work on SARS-CoV-2. We focus on the post-receptor binding events and cellular pathways that direct the membrane fusion events necessary for genome delivery, including S proteolytic priming and activation.

Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs which include extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, p38 proteins, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3) and ERK5. p38 MAPK is activated by a wide range of cellular stresses and modulates activity of several downstream kinases and transcription factors which are involved in regulating cytoskeleton remodeling, cell cycle modulation, inflammation, antiviral response and apoptosis. In viral infections, activation of cell signalling pathways is part of the cellular defense mechanism with the basic aim of inducing an antiviral state. However, viruses can exploit enhanced cell signalling activities to support various stages of their replication cycles. Kinase activity can be inhibited by small molecule chemical inhibitors, so one strategy to develop antiviral drugs is to target these cellular signalling pathways. In this review, we provide an overview on the current understanding of various cellular and viral events regulated by the p38 signalling pathway, with a special emphasis on targeting these events for antiviral drug development which might identify candidates with broad spectrum activity.","output":"Role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling in virus replication and potential for developing broad spectrum antiviral drugs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aside the direct effect of the COVID-19 on infected patients, this infectious disease outbreak has various psychological consequences.

Qualitative health research, focused on individual perspectives of health, wellness, illness, and recovery, has emerged as a unique sub-discipline of this field. With distinct foci, methods, and rules, qualitative health research has the potential to answer applied health research questions to inform practice, education, and policy. Despite this potential, there are challenges to the application of qualitative health research methods in nutrition and dietetics research. These include limited training and mentorship availability for the rigorous application of these methods as well as misaligned goals between the traditional social science-based qualitative approaches and emerging applied nutrition science needs. Recognizing these limitations, this review aims to provide guidance to the nutrition scientist conducting applied qualitative health research. Using nutrition and dietetic examples from the literature, this review defines qualitative health research and advances the EPPiC framework as a tool for constructing structured overarching research questions and introduces four qualitative health research designs (qualitative description, interpretive description, case study, and focused ethnography) relevant to applied nutrition science.

A path analysis confirmed that teachers who appraised themselves as more susceptible to disease experienced heightened levels of fear of COVID-19, which led to heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. Specifically, germ aversion and perceived infectability were separately associated with heightened fear of COVID-19, which in turn was associated with heightened anxiety.

While public health measures remain the most effective protection strategy at this stage, when the peak passes, it will leave in its wake important health problems. Historically, very few viruses have ever been eradicated. Instead, the virus may persist in communities causing recurrent local outbreaks of the acute infection as well as several chronic diseases that may arise from the presence of a suppressed virus or as a consequence of the initial exposure. An ideal solution would be an anti-viral medication that (i) targets multiple stages of the viral lifecycle, (ii) is insensitive to frequent changes of viral phenotype due to mutagenesis, (iii) has broad spectrum, (iv) is safe and (v) also targets co-morbidities of the infection. In this Perspective we discuss a therapeutic approach that owns these attributes, namely lipid raft therapy. Lipid raft therapy is an approach aimed at reducing the abundance and structural modifications of host lipid rafts or at targeted delivery of therapeutics to the rafts. Lipid rafts are the sites of the initial binding, activation, internalization and cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They also are key regulators of immune and inflammatory responses, dysregulation of which is characteristic to COVID-19 infection. Lipid raft therapy was successful in targeting many viral infections and inflammatory disorders, and can potentially be highly effective for treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Targeting Lipid RaftsA Potential Therapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, bioethical analyses often emphasized population health and societal benefit.

Yet communities are not monolithic, and the impacts of these restrictions affect different groups differently. An ophthalmological unit outreach program in Ethiopia serves to illustrate. Pre-operative screening policies were designed to protect as many patients as possible but had adverse impacts on underserved communities.

We focus on strong social distancing, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards nonquarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of the active phase.

Associated annual health care costs run into billions. National treatment guidance includes initial lifestyle advice, followed by anti-hypertensive medication if blood pressure (BP) remains high. However, adoption and adherence to recommended exercise guidelines, dietary advice and anti-hypertensive medication is poor. Four short bouts of isometric exercise (IE) performed 3 days per week (d/wk) at home elicits clinically significant reductions in BP in those with normal to high-normal BP. This study will determine the feasibility of delivering personalised IE to patients with Stage 1 hypertension for whom lifestyle changes would be recommended before medication within NHS primary care. Methods: : This is a randomised controlled feasibility study. Participants 18+ years, with Stage 1 hypertension, not on anti-hypertensive medication and without significant medical contraindications. Trial arms will be standard lifestyle advice (control) or isometric wall squat exercise and standard lifestyle advice. Primary outcomes include success of intervention delivery and change in BP. Secondary outcomes include accuracy of protocol delivery, execution of and adherence to protocol, recruitment rate, attrition, perception of intervention viability, cost, participant experience, and accuracy of home BP.

So far, the experiences and perceptions of these individuals have not been explored. The present study aims to investigate the experiences and perceptions of the family members of the healthcare professionals during COVID-19. METHODS: The present study is a qualitative research with a phenomenological design. The participants were 25 family members of healthcare professionals which were selected from the medical centres in Iran via purposeful sampling from August 2021 to October 2021. The sampling was kept on until the data became saturated. To collect data, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted online. The Colaizzi approach was used to analyse the data collected. RESULTS: The findings of the study emerged as two main themes: psychological tension with five categories (indescribable fear and worry, longing to see their loved ones, patient stone, bitter farewell, fear of the future) and dignity with four categories (acclamation, appreciation, feeling proud, spiritual growth). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family members of healthcare professionals have experienced dignity combined with the degrees of psychological tension which were beyond the experiences of the majority of people in the society, but similar to the psychological tension experienced by the families of COVID-19 victims. The families of healthcare workers are continuously anxious about the safety of their loved ones who are responsible to obtain the treatment of COVID-19 patients, which potentially jeopardizes their physical and psychological well-being. Therefore, the appreciation and support of people in the community of the family members of healthcare professionals have increased their tolerance.

The reaction scheme used to describe this mechanism is an extension of the well-known Michaelis-Menten model proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten [1]. The model I present here takes into account that one Mpro enzyme monomer interacts with another Mpro monomer in the presence of the substrate, leading to the formation of an enzyme dimer bound to one substrate molecule. Indeed, this dimer is formed by the sequentially binding of one Mpro enzyme monomer to one molecule of substrate, followed by another Mpro enzyme monomer binding to this Mpro-substrate complex. This reaction mechanism is also known in the literature as substrate-induced dimerization [3]. Starting from this new reaction scheme established for this catalytic mechanism, I derived a mathematical expression describing the catalytic rate of the active Mpro enzyme dimer as a function of the substrate concentration [S]. The plot corresponding to this substrate-induced dimerization reaction shows a function f ([S]) that is not monotonic, i.e. not strictly increasing or decreasing, but with a second derivative initially negative and then becoming positive after having passed the Vmax point. This is typically a type of curve showing a phenomenon like the one of substrate inhibition (for instance, inhibition by excess-substrate [7]). The graphical representation of this process shows an interesting behaviour: from zero M/s, the reaction rate increases progressively, similar to the kind of curve described by the Michaelis-Menten model. However, after having reached its maximum catalytic rate, Vmax, the reaction rate decreases progressively as we continue to increase the substrate concentration. I propose an explanation to this interesting behavior. At the moment where Vcat is maximum, we can assume that, in theory, every single substrate molecule in solution is bound to two enzyme monomers (i.e. to one active dimer). The catalytic rate is thus theoretically maximized. At the time where the reaction rate begins to decrease, we observe a new phenomenon that appears: the enzyme monomers begin to be \\"diluted\\" in the solution containing the excess substrate. The dimers begin to dissociate and to bind increasingly to the substrate as inactive monomers instead of active dimers. Hence, it is more and more unlikely for the enzyme monomers to sequentially bind twice to the same substrate molecule (here, [E] << [S]). Thus, at this stage, the substrate-induced dimerization occurs less often. At the limit, when the substrate is in high excess, there is virtually no more dimerization which occurs. This is one example of excess-substrate inhibition. Furthermore, after having established this fact, I wanted to see if this catalytic behavior was also observed in vitro. Therefore, I conducted an experiment where I measured the catalytic rate of the Mpro dimer for different substrate concentrations. The properties of my substrate construct were such, that I could determine the catalytic rate of the enzyme dimer by directly measuring the spectrophotometric absorbance of the cleaved substrate at{lambda} = 405 nm. The results show explicitly -- within a margin of error -- that the overall shape of the experimental curve looks like the one of the theoretical curve. I thus conclude that the biochemical behavior of the Mpro in vitro follows a new path when it is in contact with its substrate: an excess substrate concentration decreases the activity of the enzyme by the phenomenon of a type of excess-substrate inhibition. This finding could open a new door in the discovery of drugs directed against the Mpro enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, acting on the inhibition by excess-substrate of the Mpro enzyme, this protein being a key component in the metabolism of the virus. Furthermore, I have established that the maximum of the fitted curve, Vmax, depends only on [E]T and not on [S]. [Formula] exhibits the same dependence pattern. Therefore, if I keep [E]T close to zero, the catalytic rate of the enzyme will also be greatly reduced, which can be understood intuitively. Finally, if we dilute the enzyme sufficiently in the host cell by injecting a suitably high concentration of the octapeptide substrate AVLQSGFR (an inhibitor of the original substrate), this artificial substrate will bind to the \\"intermediate\\" dimer from the polypeptide and prevent the precursor Mpro from auto-cleaving and dimerizing due to the \\"distorted key\\" effect of the octapeptide on the \\"intermediate\\" dimer. The precursor peptide Mpro will auto-cleave to a lesser extent than in the absence of the artificial octapeptide and thus the concentration of the total enzyme [E]T will be lowered in the cell. It would therefore be possible to control the virulence of the virus by adjusting the concentration of the artificial inhibitory octapeptide. However, this is only speculation and has yet to be verified in practice.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease: a Kinetic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) Schneider) wax is used for various dermatological and pharmaceutical applications.

The current research aimed to elucidate the impact of Jojoba wax on skin residential bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), fungal (Malassezia furfur), and virus infection (herpes simplex 1; HSV-1). First, the capacity of four commercial wax preparations to attenuate their growth was evaluated. The results suggest that the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Malassezia furfur was unaffected by Jojoba in pharmacologically relevant concentrations. However, the wax significantly attenuated HSV-1 plaque formation. Next, a complete doseCresponse analysis of four different Jojoba varieties (Benzioni, Shiloah, Hatzerim, and Sheva) revealed a similar anti-viral effect with high potency (EC(50) of 0.96  0.4 g/mL) that blocked HSV-1 plaque formation. The antiviral activity of the wax was also confirmed by real-time PCR, as well as viral protein expression by immunohistochemical staining. Chemical characterization of the fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition was performed, showing high similarity between the wax of the investigated varieties. Lastly, our results demonstrate that the observed effects are independent of simmondsin, repeatedly associated with the medicinal impact of Jojoba wax, and that Jojoba wax presence is required to gain protection against HSV-1 infection.

All eight fungi grew in both cultivation systems, but growth was more variable and with more noise in the data in the Cytomat plate hotel than in the BioScreen. Specific growth rates between 0.01 (no added substrate) and 0.07 h-1 were measured for strains growing in the BioScreen and between 0.01 and 0.27 h-1 for strains in the plate hotel. Three strains, Dendryphiella salina LF304, Penicillium chrysogenum KF657 and Penicillium pinophilum LF458, consistently had higher specific growth rates on glucose and xylose in the plate hotel than in the BioScreen, but otherwise results were similar in the two systems. However, because of the noise in data from the plate hotel, the data obtained from it could only be used to distinguish between substrates which did or did not support growth, whereas data from BioScreen also provided information on substrate preference. Glucose was the preferred substrate for all strains, followed by xylose and galactose. Five strains also grew on glycerol. Therefore it was important to minimise the amount of glycerol introduced with the inoculum to avoid misinterpreting the results for growth on poor substrates.

DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study using data from a survey of bereaved family members of Veterans administered from March-June 2020. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. SETTING: VA medical centers with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases during the study period. PARTICIPANTS: Next-of-kin of 328 Veterans who died in one of 37 VA medical centers' acute care, intensive care, nursing home, or hospice units. MEASUREMENTS: Open-ended survey questions (response rate = 37%) about family member's perceptions of: (1) communication with the healthcare team about the patient, (2) communication with the patient, and (3) use of remote communication technologies. RESULTS: Bereaved family members identified contextual factors perceived to impact communication quality including: allowing family at the bedside when death is imminent, fears that the patient died alone, and overall perceptions of VA care. Characteristics of perceived high-quality communication included staff availability for remote communication and being kept informed of the patient's condition and plan of care. Low-quality communication with staff was perceived to result from limited access to staff, insufficient updates regarding the patient's condition, and when the family member was not consulted about care decision-making. Communication quality with the patient was facilitated or impeded by the availability and use of video-enabled remote technologies. CONCLUSION: Communication between patients, families, and healthcare teams at the end of life remains critically important during times of limited in-person visitation.

Secondary outcomes were changes in overall management. A logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors predictive of mortality. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients were included. Half of the patients with an abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan had signs of severity at diagnosis, four times higher than the previous year. Non-COVID patients underwent surgery more often than the COVID group. Over 1/3 of 100 operated patients had postoperative morbidity, versus only 15% the previous year. The most common complications were septic shock, pneumonia, and ARDS. ICU care was required in 17% of patients, and was most often required in the SARS-CoV-2-infected group, which also had a higher morbidity and mortality. The 30-day mortality in the surgical series was of 7%, with no differences with the previous year. The strongest independent predictors of overall mortality were age > 70 years, ASA III-IV, ESS > 9, and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large integrated health care delivery system in California. Patients with BHVs and AF treated with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban between September 12, 2011 and June 18, 2020 were identified. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin were determined. Use of DOACs gradually increased since 2011, with a significant upward in trend after a stay-at-home order related to COVID-19. Among 2672 adults with BHVs and AF who met the inclusion criteria, 439 were exposed to a DOAC and 2233 were exposed to warfarin. For the primary effectiveness outcome of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and transient ischemic attack, no significant association was observed between use of DOACs compared with warfarin (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96-1.48, p=0.11). Use of DOACs was associated with lower risk of the primary safety outcome of intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other bleed (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85, p <0.001).

This variant is found to be 2-fold more infectious than the Delta variant, posing a significant threat of severe cases and death. We and others have recently reported that the N-terminus domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 of various variants is responsible for inducing cytokine release in human PBMCs. Here, we demonstrate that the NTD of the Omicron variant remains highly effective at inducing cytokine release in human PBMCs. Furthermore, we show that Ponatinib and a novel compound, Olverembatinib, are potent Omicron NTD-mediated cytokine release inhibitors. Target profiling revealed that Olverembatinib blocks most of the previously identified kinases responsible for cytokine release. Together, we propose that Ponatinib and Olverembatinib may represent an attractive therapeutic option for treating moderate to severe COVID-19 cases. HIGHLIGHTS The N-terminus domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant strongly induces multiple inflammatory molecules in PBMCs, unaffected by the mutations observed in the NTD. The cytokine release mediated by the Omicron variant is comparable to the Delta variant. Olverembatinib, a clinical-stage multi-kinase inhibitor, potently inhibits Omicron NTD-mediated cytokine release.

Despite the introduction of vaccines against the disease, there is still a long way to completely eradicate it. There are concerns about the complications following infection with SARS-CoV-2. This research aimed to evaluate the possible correlation between infection with SARS-CoV viruses and cancer in an in-silico study model. To do this, the relevent dataset was selected from GEO database. Identification of differentially expressed genes among defined groups including SARS-CoV, SARS-dORF6, SARS-BatSRBD, and H1N1 were screened where the |Log FC|  1and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Later, the pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology (GO) were used by Enrichr and Shiny GO databases. Evaluation with STRING online was applied to predict the functional interactions of proteins, followed by Cytoscape analysis to identify the master genes. Finally, analysis with GEPIA2 server was carried out to reveal the possible correlation between candidate genes and cancer development. The results showed that the main molecular function of up- and down-regulated genes was double-stranded RNA binding and actin-binding, respectively. STRING and Cytoscape analysis presented four genes, PTEN, CREB1, CASP3, and SMAD3 as the key genes involved in cancer development. According to TCGA database results, these four genes were up-regulated notably in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of physician burnout and its relationship to gender, physician specialties, and age in the WHOs EMR based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Al Manhal databases and synthesized the findings from the included studies. RESULTS: Among the 78 studies included, data was available from 16/22 (72.7%) countries and territories in the EMR covering a total of 16 016 physicians. The pooled prevalence of overall burnout among physicians in the region was estimated to be 24.5%. Among the sub-components of burnout, we estimated a high pooled prevalence of 44.26% for emotional exhaustion followed by 37.83% for depersonalization and 36.57% for low personal achievement. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence across the countries in the EMR and among the sub-categories of specialist medical practitioners. There was no statistically significant difference across the two genders at a regionally aggregated level. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of physician burnout including the three sub-components in EMR are high by any standards. Based on our review of available studies, it is difficult to ascertain gender differences with certainty in burnout levels among physicians in the EMR nations.

We tested whether high quality listening would predict attitudes related to speakers' prejudices and whether self-insight would mediate this effect. Study 1 (preregistered) examined scripted conversations characterized by high, regular, and poor listening quality. In Study 2, we manipulated high versus regular listening quality in the laboratory as speakers talked about their prejudiced attitudes. Finally, Study 3 (preregistered) used a more robust measure of prejudiced attitudes to test whether perceived social acceptance could be an alternative explanation to Study 2 findings. Across these studies, the exploratory (pilot study and Study 2) and confirmatory (Studies 1 & 3) findings were in line with expectations that high, versus regular and poor, quality listening facilitated lower prejudiced attitudes because it increased self-insight.

To dissect the function of an REN element involved in plus-strand RNA synthesis, we developed an in vitro trans-replication assay for tombusviruses, which are small plus-strand RNA viruses. In this assay, two RNA strands were tethered together via short complementary regions with the REN present in the nontemplate RNA, whereas the promoter was located in the template RNA. We found that the template activity of the tombusvirus replicase preparation was stimulated in trans by the REN, suggesting that the REN is a functional enhancer when located in the vicinity of the promoter. In addition, this study revealed that the REN has dual function during RNA synthesis. (i) It binds to the viral replicase. (ii) It interacts with the core plus-strand initiation promoter via a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction, which leads to stimulation of initiation of plus-strand RNA synthesis by the replicase in vitro. We also observed that this RNA-RNA interaction increased the in vivo accumulation and competitiveness of defective interfering RNA, a model template. We propose that REN is important for asymmetrical viral RNA replication that leads to more abundant plus-strand RNA progeny than the minus-strand intermediate, a hallmark of replication of plus-strand RNA viruses.","output":"Mechanism of stimulation of plus-strand synthesis by an RNA replication enhancer in a tombusvirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, reliable prediction plays an important role in policymaking The classical infectious disease model SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal model The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19 In this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and forecasting We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature (local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect) For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization For edge feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective and robust for prediction The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US, out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and 7-day ahead forecasting Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening and provides potential outcomes for policymakers ? 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda All rights reserved","output":"A spatial-temporal graph based hybrid infectious disease model with application to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of COVID-19, the production demand of medical equipment is increasing rapidly.

A new pathophysiological model describes the development of neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) as the combined result of prenatal inflammation and hypoxicCischemic insult. Neuroinflammation and a systemic inflammatory response are also important features of NAIS. Identifying key players of the inflammatory system is in the limelight of current research. CASE PRESENTATION: We present four NAIS cases, in whom detailed analysis of intracellular and plasma cytokine levels are available from the first month of life. All neonates were admitted with the initial diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); however, early MRI examination revealed NAIS. Blood samples were collected between 3 and 6 h of life, at 24 h, 72 h, 1 week, and 1 month of life. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed with flow cytometry and plasma cytokine levels were measured. Pooled data from the cohort of four NAIS patients were compared to infants with HIE. At 6 and 72 h of age, the prevalence of IL10+ CD8+ lymphocytes remained lower in NAIS. At 6 h, CD8+ lymphocytes in NAIS produced more IL-17. At 72 h, CD8+ cells produced more IL-6 in severe HIE than in NAIS, but IL-6 production remained elevated in CD8 cells at 1 month in NAIS, while it decreased in HIE. At 1 week, the prevalence of TGF- + lymphocytes prone to enter the CNS was elevated in NAIS. On the other hand, by 1 month of age, the prevalence of TGF- + CD4+ lymphocytes decreased in NAIS compared to HIE. At 72 h, we found elevated plasma levels of IL-5, MCP-1, and IL-17 in NAIS. By 1 month, plasma levels of IL-4, IL-12, and IL-17 decreased in NAIS but remained elevated in HIE. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the cytokine network are present between NAIS and HIE. CD8 lymphocytes appear to shift towards the pro-inflammatory direction in NAIS.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa already faced intersecting mental health stressors and vulnerabilities. It is critical to understand how additional challenges brought on by COVID-19 have intersected with existing vulnerabilities and mental health risks AGYW faced, particularly given the intersections between psychological distress and increased risk behaviours that impact sexual and reproductive health. We aimed to examine socio-economic and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on South African AGYW in order to understand how additional challenges brought on by COVID-19 have intersected with existing challenges, compounding AGYW vulnerabilities. METHODS: Using qualitative and quantitative methods, framed by the syndemic theory, we examined the intersections between mental health and the COVID-19 epidemic amongst AGYW in six districts of South Africa characterised by high rates of HIV, teenage pregnancy and socio-economic hardship. Between November 2020 and March 2021 we conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey with 515 AGYW, and in-depth interviews with 50 AGYW, aged 15 to 24 years. RESULTS: Our findings reveal how COVID-19 restrictions led to increased experiences of stress and anxiety. Poor mental health was compounded by strained family relationships, increased fear of domestic violence, household unemployment, economic stress and food insecurity. Respondents described feelings of boredom, frustration, isolation, loneliness, fear and hopelessness. However, despite the multitude of challenges, some AGYW articulated emotional resilience, describing ways in which they coped and retained hope. CONCLUSION: Various psycho-social risk factors already disproportionally affect the mental health of AGYW in these communities; the COVID-19 pandemic intersects with these pre-existing social and environmental factors. Understanding strategies AGYW have used to positively cope with the uncertainty of COVID-19 amongst an array of pre-existing mental health stressors, is key in informing efforts to respond to their needs. Multisectoral interventions are needed to address the drivers of poor mental health among AGYW, and bolster healthy coping mechanisms; interventions seeking to mitigate the mental health impacts on this vulnerable population need to be responsive to the unpredictable pandemic environment.","output":"Intersections between COVID-19 and socio-economic mental health stressors in the lives of South African adolescent girls and young women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the clinical phenotype and genetic findings of two variants in PDE6C underlying achromatopsia (ACHM).

As healthcare systems have been pushed to the limit, keeping critical medical equipment (such as ventilators) in working order has become a matter of life and death. Unfortunately, the ability of hospitals and other health care providers to service and fix their medical equipment is often hindered by the tight control that original equipment manufacturers keep over repair of their products. On top of direct contractual restrictions on repair, one of the major difficulties encountered by hospital-based and third-party service providers is the lack of access to service manuals, service keys, schematics, replacement parts, and repair tools. The ability to block access to these critical items is abetted, in large part, by intellectual property laws.In August 2020, a new federal legislation was introduced to address this problemthe Critical Medical Infrastructure Right-to-Repair Act of 2020 (the Act). The Act is designed to facilitate repair of critical medical infrastructure during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and to do so, it addresses various relevant intellectual property issues. This Article provides a critical analysis of the Act and examines the extent to which it could serve its prescribed goal. We also investigate the role that courts could play, alongside such legislation, by using policy levers that already exist in intellectual property law to provide relief to hospital-based and independent service technicians and mandate manufacturers to cooperate with them in certain circumstances.","output":"Repairing Medical Equipment in Times of Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rare-earth elements are emerging contaminants of soil and water bodies which destiny in the environment and effects on organisms is modulated by their interactions with natural ligands produced by bacteria, fungi and plants. Within this framework, coordination by harzianic acid (H2L), a Trichoderma secondary metabolite, of a selection of tripositive rare-earth cations Ln3+ (Ln3+ = La3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, and Gd3+) was investigated at 25 C, and in a CH3OH/0.1 M NaClO4 (50/50 w/w) solvent, using mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and pH measurements. Experimental data can be satisfactorily explained by assuming, for all investigated cations, the formation of a mono-complex (LnL+) and a bis-complex (LnL2-). Differences were found between the formation constants of complexes of different Ln3+ cations, which can be correlated with ionic radius. Since gadolinium is the element that raises the most concern among lanthanide elements, its effects on organisms at different levels of biological organization were explored, in the presence and absence of harzianic acid.

The current public health emergency has required rapid implementation of increased handwashing in the general public; however, rapidly changing health behavior, especially on this scale, is difficult. This study considers attitudes and affective responses to handwashing as possible factors predicting COVID-19 related changes to handwashing behavior, future intentions, and readiness to change during the early stages of the pandemic in the United States. Income was explored as a potential moderator to these relationships. To explore these issues, data from 344 community participants were analyzed. Results indicate that stronger affective responses toward handwashing relate to increases in handwashing since the outbreak of COVID-19, and both attitudes and affect uniquely predict handwashing intentions. Income significantly moderated the relationship between affect and readiness to change. Those with low income were more influenced by both affective responses and attitudes. These results suggest messages targeting both cognitions and affective responses are needed to increase the handwashing behavior during a global pandemic and these variables are critical in increasing readiness to change in low-income individuals.","output":"The Role of Attitudes, Affect, and Income in Predicting COVID-19 Behavioral Intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization defines the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as a new syndrome reported in patients aged < 19 years old who have a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Qualitative exploration was undertaken using dyadic or one-to-one in-depth interviews with service users in the UK with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder. Service providers, including mental health and dental health professionals, and informal carers (people identified as family or friend who are not paid carers) were also interviewed. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main cross-cutting themes at the personal, inter-personal and systems level: amelioration of the problem, using a tailored approach and provision of comprehensive support. The main barriers identified were impact of mental ill-health, lack of patient involvement and tailored approach, and accessibility and availability of dental services including lack of integration of services. The main facilitators identified were service providers effective communication skills and further support through the involvement of carers. The findings suggest that the integration of dental and mental health services to provide tailored support for overall health and well-being, including the oral health of the patient, can better support people with severe mental illness regarding their oral health needs.","output":"A Qualitative Study Exploring the Barriers and Facilitators for Maintaining Oral Health and Using Dental Service in People with Severe Mental Illness: Perspectives from Service Users and Service Providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Government of India in networks with its state government has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak .

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43C63), and 20 (588%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [912%]), fatigue (25 [735%]) and dry cough (18 [529%]). 15 (441%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (205%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury.

(2) Many public COVID\\\\19 data sets contain only a few images without fine\\\\grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID\\\\19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID\\\\19.

During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self\\\\knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones.

Active transportation is included in interdisciplinary strategies to meet these recommendations. Cycling seems to be more health enhancing than walking for transportation since cycling seems to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. Furthermore, the health benefits of cycling are proven to outrun the risk of injuries and mortality. Politicians seem to approve costly infrastructure strategies to increase the amount of cycling in the population to improve public health and shift to more sustainable travel habits. A linear relationship between cycle-friendly infrastructure and the amount of commuter cycling has been demonstrated. However, in Norway and on a global level, there is a lack of robust evaluations of actions and sensitive monitoring systems to observe possible change. Therefore, we aimed to develop the Norwegian bike traffic index and describe the national, regional, and local trends in counted cycle trips. We used a transparent methodology so that the index can be used, developed, and adapted in other countries. We included 89 stationary counters from the whole country. Counters monitored cycling from 2018 onward. The index is organized at local, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, the index is adjusted for population density at the counter level and presented as ratio of counted cycle trips, comparing 2018 to subsequent years. The index is presented as a percentage change with 95% confidence intervals.

By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays.

Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses. Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response. However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive.

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled individuals aged  60 years with baseline blood pressure  120/ 80 mmHg from the ongoing Atahualpa Project cohort who received retinal photographs (for HTRP grading) and a brain MRI. We ascertained all-cause mortality after a mean of 5.2  1.2 years of follow-up. Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, neuroimaging signatures of cerebral small vessel disease, blood pressure determinations during follow-up and incident strokes, were obtained to estimate mortality risk according to HTRP severity. RESULTS: Analysis included 236 participants (mean age 69.3  7.3 years). HTRP Grade 2 or higher was determined in 42 (18%) individuals. Fifty participants (21%) died during the follow-up, resulting in an overall unadjusted crude mortality rate of 4.1 per 100 person-years. Mortality rate in subjects with HTRP Grade 2 or higher was 7.2 and in those with no HTRP or Grade 1 only was 3.4 per 100 person-years.

A Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in RlucRep. Transfection of BHK cells with RlucRep RNA yielded two distinctive Rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. By contrast, only the 2- to 10-h Rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase NS5 (RlucRep-NS5mt). Immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and RNA replication increased in cells transfected with the RlucRep but not in those transfected with the RlucRep-NS5mt. These results suggest that the Rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the Rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents RNA replication. Using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (CS) elements within the 3' untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect WNV translation but severely diminished or completely abolished RNA replication. Mutations of CS1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5' region of the capsid gene (5'CS) abolished RNA replication. Restoration of the 5'CS-CS1 interaction rescued viral replication. Replicons containing individual deletions of CS2, repeated CS2 (RCS2), CS3, or RCS3 were viable, but their RNA replication was dramatically compromised. These results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5'CS-CS1 interaction is essential for WNV RNA replication, whereas CS2, RCS2, CS3, and RCS3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, WNV replication.","output":"Functional analysis of mosquito-borne flavivirus conserved sequence elements within 3' untranslated region of West Nile virus by use of a reporting replicon that differentiates between viral translation and RNA replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In November 2021, 14 international travel-related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of concern (VOC) patients were detected in South Korea.

Recent theory suggests that pathogen avoidance behavior is based not only on perceived risk but on a trade-off between the perceived costs of pathogen exposure and the perceived benefits of social contact. We hypothesized that compliance with social distancing may therefore be explained by a trade-off between pathogen avoidance and various social motives such as mate-seeking. Two studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that social distancing was positively associated with disease avoidance motives but negatively associated with social motives, especially mating motives. These associations remained after controlling for predictors identified by previous research, including risk perception and personality.

Methods: A total of 20 681 close contacts of COVID-19 cases, who had exposures during January 6, 2020 to February 15, 2021, were traced in Beijing. The information about their demographic characteristics, exposure history, and quarantine outcomes were collected and analyzed with descriptive statistics. The logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for COVID-19. Results: The infection rate SARS-CoV-2 in close contacts was 2.16% (447/20 681). The age M(P25, P75) was 35 (27, 49) years. The majority of the close contacts were aged 20-59 years, accounting for 81.77% (16 912/20 681). Centralized isolation was the major type of medical observation, accounting for 82.15% (16 989/20 681). Among the exposure types, working and studying in the same room (16.06%, 3 322/20 681), sharing same transport vehicle (12.88%, 2 664/20 681), performing diagnosis and treatment nursing (7.80%,1 612/20 681), and living together (7.23%,1 495/20 681), accounting for 43.96% (9 093/20 681). The index cases included staff (19.34%, 3 999/20 681), the unemployed (17.34%, 3 586/20 681), people engaged in business service (13.85%, 2 864/20 681), people engaged in food service (10.77%, 2 228/20 681), their close contacts accounted for 61.30% (12 677/20 681). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with other types of exposure, the risk factors for infection were having meal together (OR=3.96, 95%CI: 2.30-6.83) and living together (OR=6.41, 95%CI:4.48-9.17); Compared with the other occupations, the index case being engaged in food service (OR=3.06, 95%CI:1.29-7.25) and teacher (OR=4.94, 95%CI:1.43-17.08) were risk factors for the infection. Conclusions: The main environmental exposure types of SARS-CoV-2 infection in close contacts were having meal together and living together. Contact with the index case being engaged in food service and teacher increased the risk for COVID-19.

Thus, adjuvants are important for vaccine research. Polysaccharides isolated from select Chinese herbs have been demonstrated to possess various beneficial functions and excellent adjuvant abilities. In the present study, the polysaccharides IIP-A-1 and IIP-2 were isolated from Isatis indigotica root and compared with the common vaccine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide via intramuscular co-administration of inactivated rabies virus rCVS-11-G into mice. Blood was collected to determine virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers and B and T lymphocyte activation status. Inguinal lymph node samples were collected and used to measure B lymphocyte proliferation. Splenocytes were isolated, from which antigen-specific cellular immune responses were detected via ELISpot, ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining. The results revealed that both types of polysaccharides induce more rapid changes and higher VNA titers than aluminum hydroxide. Flow cytometry assays revealed that the polysaccharides activated more B lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and more B and T lymphocytes in the blood than aluminum hydroxide. Antigen-specific cellular immune responses showed that IIP-2 strongly induced T lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and high levels of cytokine secretion from splenocytes, whereas aluminum hydroxide induced proliferation in only a small number of lymphocytes and the secretion of only small quantities of cytokines. Collectively, these data suggest that the polysaccharide IIP-2 exhibits excellent adjuvant activity and can enhance both cellular and humoral immunity.","output":"Isatis indigotica root polysaccharides as adjuvants for an inactivated rabies virus vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 created a global public health and economic emergency.

Methods: Data on confirmed patients, with a final outcome reported as of 29 March 2020, were obtained from official websites and other internet sources. The hospitalized CFR (HCFR) was estimated, epidemiological features described, and risk factors for a fatal outcome identified. Findings: The overall CFR in China was estimated to be 4.6% (95% CI 4.5%-4.8%). It increased with age and was higher in males than females. The highest CFR observed was in male patients 70 years old. Although the outcome of infection is generally worse for males, this adverse effect from male sex decreased as people get old. Differential age/sex CFR patterns across geographical regions were found: the age effect on CFR was greater in other provinces outside Hubei than in Wuhan. An effect of longer interval from symptom onset to admission was only observed outside Hubei, not in Wuhan. By performing multivariate analysis and survival analysis, the higher CFR was associated with older age, and male sex. Only in regions outside Hubei, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, were associated with higher CFR.

Antidepressants such as SSRI and SNRI are associated with immune-modulatory effects, which dismiss inflammatory response and reduce lung tissue damage. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of antidepressant drugs on prognosis and severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus up to January 16, 2022. The following keywords were used: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"2019-nCoV\\", \\"SSRI\\", \\"SNRI\\", \\"TCA\\", \\"MAOI\\", and \\"Antidepressant\\". The pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI was assessed using a fixed or random-effect model. We considered P < 0.05 as statistically significant for publication bias. Data were analyzed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, Version 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Results: Twelve studies were included in our systematic review. Three of them were experimental with 1751, and nine of them were observational with 290,950 participants. Seven out of twelve articles revealed the effect of antidepressants on reducing severity of COVID-19. SSRI medications, including Fluvoxamine, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, and Paroxetine and also among the SNRI drugs Venlafaxine are also reasonably associated with reduced risk of intubation or death. There were four studies showing no significant effect and one study showing the negative effect of antidepressants on prognosis of covid-19. The meta-analysis on clinical trials showed that fluvoxamine could significantly decrease the severity outcomes of COVID-19 (RR: 0.745; 95% CI: 0.580-0.956) Conclusions: Most of the evidence supports that the use of antidepressant medications, mainly Fluvoxamine may decrease the severity and improve the outcome in hospitalizes patients with sars-cov-2.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was especially important to save operating room resources and to have a shorter ICU stay for patients, when ICUs had insufficient beds. In this context of limited resources, early percutaneous tracheostomy could be an effective way to manage mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, current recommendations suggest delaying or avoiding the tracheotomy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Aim of the study was to analyze the hospital mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who had received early percutaneous tracheostomy and factors associated with removal of tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU. PATIENTS Adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 3 days after ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Three days after ICU admission, 164 patients were present in ICU and included in the analysis. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (74%) were tracheostomized, whereas the other 43 (26%) were managed with translaryngeal intubation only. In multivariable analysis, early percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with lower hospital mortality. Sixty-six of tracheostomized patients (55%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Age and male sex were the only characteristics that were independently associated with mortality in the tracheostomized patients (45.5% and 62.8% in tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients, respectively; p = 0.009). Tracheostomy tube was removed in 47 of the tracheostomized patients (71%). The only variable independently associated with weaning from tracheostomy at ICU discharge was a faster start of spontaneous breathing after tracheotomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS Early percutaneous tracheostomy was safe and effective in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, giving a good chance of survival and of weaning from tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge.","output":"Early Percutaneous Tracheostomy in Coronavirus Disease 2019: Association With Hospital Mortality and Factors Associated With Removal of Tracheostomy Tube at ICU Discharge.

Initial sex-disaggregated mortality data emerging from the Wuhan province of China identified male sex as a risk factor for increased COVID-19 mortality. In this systematic review, we aimed to assess the role of sex in the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in adult patients through comparison of clinical markers and inflammatory indexes. A systematic search was conducted on the following databases: PubMed, WHO COVID-19 database, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science between the dates of June 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Key search terms used included: sex, gender, SARS-COV-2, COVID and mortality. We accepted the following types of studies concerning adult COVID-19 patients: retrospective cohort, observational cohort, case series, and applied research. Further studies were extracted from reference searching. The risk of bias was determined using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort, Cross-Sectional Studies, and Case Series. We identified a total of 16 studies published between January 2020 and June 2020 for analysis in this systematic review. Our study population consisted of 11 cohort studies, four case series, and one genetic study, including a total of 76,555 participants. Ten of the studies included in this review observed a higher risk of mortality among males compared to females, and eight of these studies found this risk to be statistically significant. Sex-disaggregated COVID-19 mortality data identifies male patients with comorbidities as being at an increased risk of mortality worldwide. Further investigation revealed differences in immune response regulated by sex hormones, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, and health behaviours as contributing factors to increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 among males. Nine out of the 16 studies included were conducted in China. In order to comprehensively assess sex-differences in the risk of mortality from COVID-19, more studies will need to be conducted worldwide. Sex-disaggregated COVID-19 data published in the medical literature is limited, however it has become evident that male sex is an important risk factor for mortality.

CFR was also positively associated with the death rate due to smoking in people over 70 years. Interestingly, CFR was negatively associated with share of death due to lower respiratory infections. Among the demographic, economic and political variables, CFR was positively associated with share of the population over 70, GDP per capita, and level of democracy, while it was negatively associated with number of hospital beds 1000. Overall, these results emphasize the role of comorbidity and socio-economic factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the population level.","output":"Explaining among-country variation in COVID-19 case fatality rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rubella usually is a mild, febrile rash illness in children and adults; however, infection early in pregnancy, particularly during the first 16 weeks, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or an infant born with birth defects (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome [CRS]).

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and low vaccination rates, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking.

First, to identify which topics pertaining to sexual-wellbeing have been assessed in transgender individuals in a medical context. Second, to determine which tools have been used for measuring aspects of sexual-wellbeing. A conceptual framework of sexual-wellbeing, was used as reference. A literature search (in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) was performed up to March 10th, 2020. Studies that assessed aspects of sexual-wellbeing in transgender individuals' medical context were included in this review. Specific sexual topics addressed in each study were extracted by two independent reviewers. Thematic analysis was performed to identify sexual themes. Additionally, tools used to measure topics related to sexuality in transgender individuals were identified. In 172 papers, a total of 178 topics related to sexual-wellbeing were identified. Ten overarching themes were identified; sexuality, enacted sexual script, sexual activities, sexual relations, sexual response cycle, genital function, sexual function, sexual pleasure, sexual satisfaction, and quality-of-sex-life. Functional aspects of sexuality are assessed most frequently. A variety of methods was used to evaluate aspects related to sexual-wellbeing in trans individuals and over 50 different tools were identified. Self-developed questionnaires were used most frequently (n = 80), followed by chart reviews (n = 50), self-developed structured interviews (n = 37) and physical examination (n = 13). 23 previously developed questionnaires were used, all of which were developed for a cisgender population.

METHODS: Tweets containing the hashtags \\"#uromatch\\" or \\"#AUAmatch\\" during the 2021 and 2022 Match Week were reviewed. Date, author type and number of followers, general content, and engagement with each Tweet was collected. Differences in engagement between author type and content were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Tweet characteristics were compared between the 2021 and 2022 Match Cycles using the Chi-Square test. RESULTS: There were 656 Tweets in total, with 272 (43.5%) from 2021 and 353 (56.5%) from 2022. Medical students' and residency programs' posts received significantly more Tweet engagement than those by residents/fellows, attendings, or the AUA (p<0.05). Tweets focusing on announcing a new residency class and personal announcements of match results received significantly more engagements than other content categories (p<0.05). In 2022, there was a significantly higher percentage of Tweets about advice for unmatched applicants (2.2 vs 12.5; p<0.001), match statistics (0.4 vs 2.9; p=0.028) and focus on underrepresented groups in urology (0.7 vs 3.4; p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The Twitter response to the urology match between 2021 and 2022 mirrored the increase in competitiveness, with greater participation and an increasing focus on the difficulty of matching.

Strategies that are both convenient and reliable for cognitive screening of AF patients remain underdeveloped. We aimed to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of computerized cognitive screening strategies using subtests from Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) in AF patients. METHODS: The Multitasking Test (MTT), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), and Paired Associates Learning (PAL) subtests from CANTAB were performed in 105 AF patients. Traditional standard neuropsychological tests were used as a reference standard. Cognitive screening models using different CANTAB subtests were established using multivariable logistic regression. Further stepwise regression using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was applied to optimize the models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to study the sensitivity and specificity of these models. RESULTS: Fifty-eight (55%) patients were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MTT alone had reasonable sensitivity (82.8%) and specificity (74.5%) for MCI screening, while RVP (sensitivity 72.4%, specificity 70.2%) and PAL (sensitivity 70.7%, specificity 57.4%) were less effective. Stepwise regression of all available variables revealed that a combination of MTT and RVP brought about higher specificity (sensitivity 82.8%, specificity 85.8%), while PAL was not included in the optimal model. Moreover, adding education to the models did not result in improved validity for MCI screening. CONCLUSION: The CANTAB subtests are feasible and effective strategies for MCI screening among AF patients independent of patients' education levels.

Finland is a country with extraordinary sauna culture and bathing opportunities. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced regulations and unprecedented closures to shared sauna facilities. In this study we aimed to examine the previously unknown baseline bathing frequency and its possible change during the epidemic. DESIGN: We investigated several aspects of sauna bathing with self-reports: the frequency, its possible changes, reasons for change, and beliefs about its health effects among a representative sample of thousand Finns aged 18-75 years. This online survey was administered in May 2020. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, 59 % of our respondents had enjoyed sauna at least once a week. Since the pandemic began, up to 23 % had reduced or stopped their bathing. This was often due to restricted sauna access. However, 11 % of respondents bathed more frequently and attributed this change to seeking relaxation and passing time. These findings demonstrate a surprising flexibility in this health-promoting national pastime. Men were more active bathers than women overall and women under 35 enjoy sauna more seldom than older women. Only 7.9 % of all respondents bathed at least four times a week, exceeding a suggested threshold for maximum health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Finnish people are active sauna bathers. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that the frequency of bathing is dependent on good access to sauna facilities.

Background: As a highly vulnerable group, people in need of long-term care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to their care-dependency, measures of social distancing can only be carried out to a very limited extent. In addition, the social and health consequences of reduced contacts are particularly high for nursing home residents. AIM: The study aims to describe the extent to which nursing homes are affected, the human and material resources of nursing homes, the organizational handling of the situation, and their requests for public support. METHODS: More than 7,000 nursing homes were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements. Data analysis applies descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 824 nursing homes participated in the survey. One in five nursing homes has at least one confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 among its residents and / or employees. The initial lack of protective equipment has now decreased, but the facilities still have to cope with additional corona-related care needs with reduced staff. Nursing homes have banned contacts between residents and relative to an extent that now has to be reduced again. Nursing homes demand the provision and external financing of protective equipment as well as the systematic and regular testing of nursing staff and the provision of uniform guidelines for action throughout Germany.

We used the Conservation Evidence database to assess the length of publication delay (time from finishing data collection to publication) in the literature that tests the effectiveness of conservation interventions. From 7,447 peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies of conservation interventions published over eleven decades, we find that the raw mean publication delay was 3.2 years (2SD = 0.1) and varied by conservation subject. A significantly shorter delay was observed for studies focused on Bee Conservation, Sustainable Aquaculture, Management of Captive Animals, Amphibian Conservation, and Control of Freshwater Invasive Species (Estimated Marginal Mean range from 1.4C1.9 years). Publication delay was significantly shorter for the non-peer-reviewed literature (Estimated Marginal Mean delay of 1.9 years  0.2) compared to the peer-reviewed literature (i.e., scientific journals; Estimated Marginal Mean delay of 3.0 years  0.1).

The impregnated monoliths of 2C3 mm in size were employed as photocatalysts to inactivate airborne bacteria under blue light, reducing the emission of living airborne bacteria up to 0.1% and 37.7% when using m-TiO(2)/CdS and m-TiO(2)/CuO, respectively. Bacteria were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry and cell lysis was confirmed by SEM, detecting collapsed bacteria. Along 96 h of continuous photocatalysis at a flow rate of 2.2 L/min, the cell concentration presented maxima and minima due to the adsorptionCdesorption stages of bioaerosols over the catalysts, in concordance with thermal gravimetric analysis. The reactivation of catalysts was achieved by calcination at 400 C, however, after a third re-cycle, the photocatalytic activity for all monoliths was practically negligible because the physicochemical surface changes hinder the adequate bioaerosol adsorption.

Method: Surveys were distributed electronically to YA between 17-30 years old and associated with the College Diabetes Network at two timepoints (spring and fall 2020). The survey included questions about hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis and/or severe hypoglycemia and challenges filling prescriptions. Chi-Square statistics were used for analyses. Results: No demographic differences were found between the spring (n=473) and fall (n=375) participants. There was a significant increase in hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia from 3.4% in the spring to 10.4% in the fall (p<.001). In the spring, 21% of participants reported difficulty filling prescriptions due to COVID-19, compared to 7.3% in the fall.

The need for social distancing and advancements of technology to facilitate the patients and doctors around the world mandated the telemedicine and remote monitoring of patience details as the pivotal way to diagnose the disease. In this, it is essential to transmit the patients information such as X-ray and scan images of them to the doctor in the remote location. Preventing the medical data from the technological adversaries is the need of the hour. Infinitesimal attacks in medical images may cost human lives. This work proposes a lightweight, secure medical image encryption scheme for the remote monitoring of health data. The proposed encryption scheme uses computationally less complex weighted shift approximate adder (WSAA)Cbased encryption logic. The scheme uses a 256-bit key for the encryption process that strengthens the encryption and robust against various attacks. The proposed encryption scheme deploys the WSAA for diffusing the pixel values. A unique way of key distribution for pixel-wise encryption within the image is proposed that avoids the need for separate logic for the pixel-wise confusion. The proposed Encryption scheme is evaluated for its entropy and horizontal, vertical, diagonal correlation, histogram, key space, and sensitivity. Experimental results affirm that the proposed scheme significantly good with less computational complexity. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of the decrypted image is infinity, and this matches the ideal requirement of the medical encryption scheme.","output":"A Novel Random Error Approximate Adder-Based Lightweight Medical Image Encryption Scheme for Secure Remote Monitoring of Health Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Malnutrition following intensive care unit (ICU) stay is frequent and could be especially prominent in critically ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients as they present prolonged inflammatory state and long length stay. We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in critically ill COVID-19 patients both at the acute and recovery phases of infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study including critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation discharged alive from a medical ICU of a university hospital. We collected demographic, anthropometric and ICU stay data (SAPS2, recourse to organ support and daily energy intake). Nutritional status and nutritional support were collected at one month after ICU discharge (M1) by phone interview and at 3 months after ICU discharge (M3) during a specialized and dedicated consultation conducted by a dietitian. Malnutrition diagnosis was based on weight loss and body mass index (BMI) criteria following the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition. Primary outcome was the prevalence of malnutrition at M3 and secondary outcomes were the evolution of nutritional status from ICU admission to M3 and factors associated with malnutrition at M3. RESULTS: From march 13th to may 15th, 2020, 38 patients were discharged alive from the ICU, median [IQR] age 66 [59C72] years, BMI 27.8 [25.5C30.7] kg/m(2) and SAPS2 47 [35C55]. Thirty-three (86%) patients were followed up to M3. Prevalence of malnutrition increased during the ICU stay, from 18% at ICU admission to 79% at ICU discharge and then decreased to 71% at M1 and 53% at M3. Severe malnutrition prevailed at ICU discharge with a prevalence of 55% decreasing 32% at M3. At M3, the only factors associated with malnutrition in univariate analysis were the length of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay (25 [16C39] vs. 11 [9C12] days, P = 0.006 and 28 [21C42] vs. 15 [11C17] days, P = 0.010, respectively), while no ICU preadmission and admission factors, nor energy and protein intakes distinguished the two groups. Only 32% of undernourished patients at M3 had benefited from a nutritional support. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is frequent, protracted and probably underrecognized among critically ill Covid-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with more than half patients still being undernourished three months after ICU discharge. A particular attention should be paid to the nutritional status of these patients not only during their ICU stay but also following ICU discharge.","output":"Evolution of the nutritional status of COVID-19 critically-ill patients: A prospective observational study from ICU admission to three months after ICU discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immigrants make up 20% of the Canadian population;however, little is known about the mortality impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2 5) air pollution on immigrants compared with non-immigrants, or about how impacts may change with duration in Canada DATA AND METHODS: This study used the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort, a longitudinal cohort of 3 5 million individuals, of which 764,000 were classified as immigrants (foreign-born) Postal codes from annual income tax files were used to account for mobility among respondents and to assign annual PM2 5 concentrations from 1998 to 2016 Exposures were estimated as a three-year moving average prior to the follow-up year Cox survival models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for cause-specific mortality, comparing the Canadian and foreign-born populations, with further stratification by year of immigration grouped into 10-year cohorts RESULTS: Differences in urban-rural settlement patterns resulted in greater exposure to PM2 5 for immigrants compared with non-immigrants (mean = 9 3 vs 7 5 g/m3), with higher exposures among more recent immigrants In fully adjusted models, immigrants had higher HRs per 10 g/m3 increase in PM2 5 concentration compared with Canadian-born individuals for cardiovascular mortality (HR [95% confidence interval] = 1 22 [1 12 to 1 34] vs 1 12 [1 07 to 1 18]) and cerebrovascular mortality (HR = 1 25 [1 03 to 1 52] vs 1 03 [0 93 to 1 15]), respectively However, tests for differences between the two groups were not significant when Cochran&#039;s Q test was used No significant associations were found for respiratory outcomes, except for lung cancer in non-immigrants (HR = 1 10 [1 02 to 1 18]) When stratified by year of immigration, differences in HRs across varied by cause of death DISCUSSION: In Canada, PM2 5 is an equal-opportunity risk factor, with immigrants experiencing similar if not higher mortality risks compared with non-immigrants for cardiovascular-related causes of death Some notable differences also existed with cerebrovascular and lung cancer deaths Continued reductions in air pollution, particularly in urban areas, will improve the health of the Canadian population as a whole","output":"Disease assimilation: The mortality impacts of fine particulate matter on immigrants to Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The altitudinal distribution of biodiversity in alpine ecosystems has captured academic attention, especially in streams because of their sensitivity to climate change. In the past years, research mainly focused on understanding the role played by alpine streams' internal factors such as aquatic environmental variables, as well as physical and hydrological conditions, on the shaping of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. More recently, external factors such as terrestrial environments were included in analyses worldwide. In particular, the inherent properties constituting the ecological niche of specific species were considered as factors regulating dispersal and influencing community construction. The objective of this study was to reveal the distribution pattern and the driving factors regulating aquatic biodiversity in alpine streams. We hypothesized that the altitudinal distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates could be explained by the interaction of the aquatic environment with both species' ecological niche and the terrestrial environment surrounding their habitat, and that rare species display a more pronounced pattern than widespread dominant species. To test these hypotheses, samples were collected from two alpine streams situated on opposite slopes of Biluo Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. Results of statistical analyses showed poor explanatory power from aquatic environmental factors, while the differences in vegetation type and the ecological niche of the species played an important role in determining the distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity. Furthermore, we found that the altitudinal distribution pattern of aquatic biodiversity exhibits a bimodal type, with rare species fitting the bimodal peaks. These findings call for a better inclusion and further investigation on the effects of the terrestrial environment on aquatic ecosystems.","output":"The ecological niche and terrestrial environment jointly influence the altitudinal pattern of aquatic biodiversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread rapidly throughout the human population, the concept of herd immunity has attracted the attention of both decision-makers and the general public.

We argue that adopting such an approach should be avoided for several reasons. There are significant uncertainties about whether achieving herd immunity is possible. If possible, achieving herd immunity would impose a large burden on society. There are gaps in protection, making it difficult to shield the vulnerable.

Approximately 40% of primary RSV infections in children result in lower respiratory tract disease. Approximately 1% of RSV-infected children require hospitalization. Especially in high-risk children, primary RSV infection results in significant morbidity and, sometimes, death. This high-risk group includes children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children with congenital heart disease, premature infants less than 6 months of age, and children with immunodeficiency diseases. It has been estimated that, in the United States, 14,000 infants with chronic lung disease and 16,400 infants with heart disease will be identified by 12 months of age. More than 91,000 children are hospitalized annually with lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, and 4500 deaths occur. In 1985 a report from the Institute of Medicine calculated that the annual hospitalization costs attributable to RSV infection were $300 million. Data collected at the New England Medical Center in 1991 show that the average cost of hospitalization of a child with RSV was $808 each day. Because of difficulty in developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine, attention is now focused on passive immunization using an RSV immune globulin. On the basis of a recently completed multiinstitutional trial, RSV immune globulin appears to be a safe and cost-effective option for prevention of severe RSV disease in high-risk children.

The female sex hormones and the immune stimulatory genes, including Toll-like receptors, interleukins, and micro-RNAs present on X-chromosome, may impart lesser infectivity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 in females over males. The sex hormone estrogen interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, one of the most critical pathways in COVID-19 infectivity, and modulates the vasomotor homeostasis. Testosterone on the contrary enhances the levels of the two most critical molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2), transcriptionally and posttranslationally, thereby increasing viral load and delaying viral clearance in men as compared with women.

Patients subsequently admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into the early intubation versus the delayed or no intubation group. Results: : During the study period, a total of 101 patients (37% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the hospital. Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards with a mortality of 3% and median length of stay of 7 days. Forty-two patients (19% female, median age 65 years, 62% with at least one comorbidity, 14% never intubated) were admitted in the ICU;all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality (21% versus 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 versus 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no intubation. Conclusions: : A strategy of early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to delayed or no intubation.

However, recently, there has been drastic reduction, both in gross anatomy teaching hours and its context. Additionally, a decrease in the number of trained anatomists and an increase in the costs associated with procuring human cadavers have been noted, causing a diminution of cadaveric dissections in anatomy education. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, there is an ardent need for a pedagogical framework such that anatomy education can be disseminated through active learning principles, within a fixed time frame, using a small team of anatomists and a small number of cadaveric specimens (for live on-site sessions) as well as collaborative learning principles. The latter is particularly important when anatomy education is delivered through distance learning, as is the case currently during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Here, we have blueprinted a pedagogical framework blending the instructional design models of Gagne's 9 events of instruction with Peyton's 4-step approach. The framework's applicability was validated through the delivery of anatomical concepts, using an exemplar from the structure-function course Head and Neck during the normal and COVID-19-mandated lockdown periods, employing the archetype of Frey syndrome. Preliminary evaluation of the framework was pursued using student feedback and end-of-course feedback responses. The efficiency of the framework in knowledge transfer was also appraised. RESULTS: The blueprinted instructional plan designed to implement the pedagogical framework was successfully executed in the dissemination of anatomy education, employing a limited number of cadaveric specimens (during normal times) and a social media application (SMA)-integrated \\"interactome\\" strategy (during the COVID-19 lockdown). Students' response to the framework was positive. However, reluctance was expressed by a majority of the faculty in adopting the framework for anatomy education. To address this aspect, a strategy has been designed using Mento's 12-step change management model. The long-term benefits for any medical school to adopt the blended pedagogical framework have also been explicated by applying Bourdieu's Theory of Practice. Additionally, through the design of an SMA interactome model, the framework's applicability to the delivery of anatomy education and content during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was realized. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the study effectively tackles some of the contemporary key challenges associated with the delivery of anatomy content in medical education during normal and unprecedented times.","output":"Confronting the Challenges of Anatomy Education in a Competency-Based Medical Curriculum During Normal and Unprecedented Times (COVID-19 Pandemic): Pedagogical Framework Development and Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Isopropanol is a readily available substance, which can cause disastrous consequences if ingested even in a relatively small amount. High degree of suspicion is required for identification. This issue has become more concerning in light of the increasing exposure to household disinfectants and cases of toxicity in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 70 year-old African American woman presented after being found difficult to arouse by her son. Her last known well was 1 hour prior to presentation. She was profoundly lethargic on arrival, hypotensive and having profuse hematemesis. She was intubated for airway protection. Her hypotension did not respond to intravenous fluid and required vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg. She was found to have ketonuria and severely elevated osmolar gap with no acidosis. Her mental status continued to deteriorate and she became dependent on mechanical ventilation. After further probing, her son noted he had found an empty bottle of rubbing alcohol in her room. No evidence of co-ingestion of other toxic substances were found on laboratory evaluation. She was observed for 8 hours with no discernible improvement in her mental status or hemodynamics. Hemodialysis was initiated for isopropanol clearance. Within 1 hour the patient became alert and hemodynamically stable. She was extubated without incident and mental status returned to baseline. DISCUSSION: Isopropanol is one of the most ubiquitous toxic substances, especially in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unlike ethylene glycol and methanol, isopropanol is more toxic than its metabolites. It reaches peak serum levels within minutes of ingestion. The minimum documented lethal dose is estimated at 100 ml. Isopropanol intoxication presents non-specifically, usually manifesting as central nervous system impairment and gastrointestinal upset. Most ingestion only result in mild symptoms. Massive ingestion may result in hemorrhagic gastritis or circulatory collapse. Hypotension is associated with a near 50% mortality rate. Identification of isopropanol poisoning is challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and subtle laboratory abnormalities. An increased osmolal gap and positive ketonemia are frequently the only abnormalities observed. In life threatening cases hemodialysis has been utilized with some success as a rescue therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Isopropanol intoxication requires a high degree of clinical suspicion is required for early identification and intervention in life threatening cases. In doing so significant morbidity and mortality may be prevented. No antidotes or neutralizing agents are currently available. Further study is needed to determine which patients would benefit most from hemodialysis with isopropanol intoxication. REFERENCE #1: Abramson S, Singh AK.

RESULTS: The structure in which leaders worked was described as: from the day-to-day grind to derailment and from manning the hospital to manning the frontlines. Five phenomenological themes were as follows: embodied leadership, navigating differently, trusting and earning trust, being the calm voice and envisioning the future. CONCLUSION: Disaster policies and procedures are needed that will alleviate leadership angst, maximize nursing resources, heighten trust and enhance communications.

Although better population health outcomes are seen in Israel, Denmark has a substantially higher healthcare expenditure. This has caused Danish policy makers to take an interest in Israeli community care organization. Consequently, we aim to provide a more detailed insight into differences between the two countries healthcare organization and cost, as well as health outcomes. METHODS: A comparative analysis combining data from OECD, WHO, and official sources. World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics were used, and national official sources were procured from the two healthcare systems. Literature searches were performed in areas relevant to expenditure and outcome. Data were compared on health care expenditure and selected outcome measures. Expenditure was presented as purchasing power parity and as percentage of gross domestic product, both with and without adjustment for population age, and both including and excluding long-term care expenditure. RESULTS: Denmarks healthcare expenditure is higher than Israels. However, corrected for age and long-term care the difference diminishes. Life expectancy is lower in Denmark than in Israel, and Israel has a significantly better outcome regarding cancer as well as a lower number of Years of Potential Life Lost. Israelis have a healthier lifestyle, in particular a much lower alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: Attempting to correct for what we deemed to be the most important influencing factors, age and different inclusions of long-term care costs, the Israeli healthcare system still seems to be 25% less expensive, compared to the Danish one, and with better health outcomes. This is not necessarily a function of the Israeli healthcare system but may to a great extent be explained by cultural factors, mainly a much lower Israeli alcohol consumption.","output":"Similarities and differences between two well-performing healthcare systems: a comparison between the Israeli and the Danish healthcare systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of individuals with empty stomachs in a population (i.e. the proportion of individuals \\"running on empty\\") can be used as a simple index of instantaneous energy balance of some organisms such as lizards and fishes.

It was found that a protein recovery of about 30% could be achieved. Increases in pH (pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5) not only improved protein recovery, but also increased protein denaturation evidenced by decreased solubility, decreased -helix, increased -sheet, and increased random coil. The color and texture of gels made from protein isolate were greatly affected by the pH values used for protein extraction. For the gels made from fillet mince, and protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, the \\"L\\" values were 78.96, 60.38, 57.74, and 54.39, the breaking forces were 205, 492, 585, and 458 g, and deformation values were 10.59, 8.07, 6.73, and 5.04 mm, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed protein degradation during alkali-aided extraction with MHC, the most predominant band, showing about 50% decrease in comparison with fillet mince. It also demonstrated that gelation not only caused cross-linking, but also autolysis with 53%, 56%, 59%, and 81% decrease in MHC intensity for fillet mince, protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, respectively. Fillet mince and protein isolates exhibited different storage modulus patterns during temperature sweep, implying different gelation mechanisms. This study proved the protein extracted from catfish byproducts was potential to be utilized as edible food components especially in gel making. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Catfish byproducts, which account for 70% of total weight and 50% of total protein of catfish, are normally used as animal feed, fertilizer, or even waste.

However, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with host and develops multiple symptoms is largely unexplored. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis determined the sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and human genomes. Diverse fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genome containing Human Identical Sequences (HIS) were cloned into the lentiviral vector. HEK293T, MRC5 and HUVEC were infected with laboratory-packaged lentivirus or transfected with plasmids or antagomirs for HIS. Quantitative RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detected gene expression and H3K27ac enrichment, respectively. UV-Vis spectroscopy assessed the interaction between HIS and their target locus. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay evaluated the hyaluronan (HA) levels of culture supernatant and plasma of COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: Five short sequences (24C27 nt length) sharing identity between SARS-CoV-2 and human genome were identified. These RNA elements were highly conserved in primates. The genomic fragments containing HIS were predicted to form hairpin structures in silico similar to miRNA precursors. HIS may function through direct genomic interaction leading to activation of host enhancers, and upregulation of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokine genes and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). HIS antagomirs and Cas13d-mediated HIS degradation reduced HAS2 expression. Severe COVID-19 patients displayed decreased lymphocytes and elevated D-dimer, and C-reactive proteins, as well as increased plasma hyaluronan. Hymecromone inhibited hyaluronan production in vitro, and thus could be further investigated as a therapeutic option for preventing severe outcome in COVID-19 patients.

This report summarizes the initial epidemiologic findings, clinical description, and diagnostic findings that followed the identification of SARS in Canada. METHODS SARS was first identified in Canada in early March 2003. We collected epidemiologic, clinical, and diagnostic data from each of the first 10 cases prospectively as they were identified. Specimens from all cases were sent to local, provincial, national, and international laboratories for studies to identify an etiologic agent. RESULTS The patients ranged from 24 to 78 years old; 60 percent were men. Transmission occurred only after close contact. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (in 100 percent of cases) and malaise (in 70 percent), followed by nonproductive cough (in 100 percent) and dyspnea (in 80 percent) associated with infiltrates on chest radiography (in 100 percent). Lymphopenia (in 89 percent of those for whom data were available), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (in 80 percent), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (in 78 percent), and elevated creatinine kinase levels (in 56 percent) were common. Empirical therapy most commonly included antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intravenous ribavirin. Mechanical ventilation was required in five patients. Three patients died, and five have had clinical improvement. The results of laboratory investigations were negative or not clinically significant except for the amplification of human metapneumovirus from respiratory specimens from five of nine patients and the isolation and amplification of a novel coronavirus from five of nine patients. In four cases both pathogens were isolated. CONCLUSIONS SARS is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

However, most of them are target-specific, limiting their application spectrum when validating assays beyond their specified targets. The use of an inactivated whole-virus RNA reference standard could be ideal, but RNA is a labile molecule that needs cold chain storage and transportation to preserve its integrity and activity. The cold chain process stretches the already dwindling storage capacities, incurs huge costs, and limits the distribution of reference materials to low-resource settings. To circumvent these issues, we developed an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference standard and studied its stability in silk fibroin matrices, i.e., silk solution (SS) and silk film (SF). Compared to preservation in nuclease-free water (ddH(2)O) and SS, SF was more stable and could preserve the SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference standard at room temperature for over 21 weeks (6 months) as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The preserved RNA reference standard in SF was able to assess the limits of detection of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. In addition, SF is compatible with RT-PCR reactions and can be used to preserve a reaction-ready primer and probe mix for RT-PCR at ambient temperatures without affecting their activity. Taken together, these results offer extensive flexibility and a simpler mechanism of preserving RNA reference materials for a long time at ambient temperatures of 25 C, with the possibility of eliminating cold chains during storage and transportation.","output":"Long-Term Preservation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Silk for Downstream RT-PCR Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike (S) glycoprotein of HCoV-NL63 is a major target in the development of diagnostic assays and vaccines, but its antigenic and immunogenic properties remain unclear.

Current phylogenetic estimates of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have around 15 defining mutations and it is hypothesised that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time.

This study aimed to systematically investigate the consistency of recommendations from the available clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to those of the WHO on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We examined CPGs and UpToDate point-of-care resources on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients that had been published as of 30 April 2020 and compared them against the CPG by the WHO. The main outcome was the rate of consistency among CPGs for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence and by excluding single CPGs one at a time. RESULTS: Thirteen reference recommendations derived from the CPG of the WHO were generated using discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states. Across CPGs, the rate of consistency in direction with the WHO is 7.7%. When insufficient evidence codings were excluded, the rate of consistency increased substantially to 61.5%. The results of a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested that the UpToDate recommendation source could explain the inconsistency. Consistency in direction rates changed by an absolute 23.1% (from 1/13 (7.7%) to 4/13 (30.8%)) if UpToDate was removed. CONCLUSIONS: We observed inconsistencies between some recommendations of the CPGs and those of the WHO. These inconsistencies should best be addressed by consensus among the relevant bodies to avoid confusion in clinical practice while awaiting clinical trials to inform us of the best practice.","output":"Consistency of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In swine production, pig movement restrictions or packing plant closures may create the need to slow growth rates of finishing pigs to ensure they remain at a marketable body weight when packing plant access is restored. Although dietary formulations can be successful at slowing pig growth, precision is needed regarding how to best formulate diets to achieve growth rate reductions. Thus, the objective was to evaluate three dietary experimental approaches aimed at slowing growth rates in finishing pigs. These approaches consisted of either increasing neutral detergent fiber (NDF), reducing essential amino acids, or reducing the dietary electrolyte balance through the addition of acidogenic salts. A total of 94 mixed-sex pigs (72.4  11.2 kg BW) across two replicates were individually penned and assigned to 1 of 8 dietary treatments (n = 11C12 pigs/treatment): 1) Control diet representative of a typical cornCsoybean meal-based finisher diet (CON); 2) diet containing 15% NDF from soybean hulls (15% NDF); 3) diet containing 20% NDF from soybean hulls (20% NDF); 4) diet containing 25% NDF from soybean hulls (25% NDF); 5) diet formulated as per CON but with 50% of the soybean meal replaced with corn (89% Corn); 6) diet containing 97% corn and no soybean meal or synthetic amino acids (97% Corn); 7) diet containing 2% anhydrous calcium chloride (2% CaCl(2)); and 8) diet containing 4% anhydrous calcium chloride (4% CaCl(2)). Over 28 d, pig body weights and performance were recorded weekly. At d 28, all pigs were ultrasound scanned and switched to the CON diet to evaluate compensatory gain from d 28 to 35. Overall, increased NDF did not impact any growth performance parameter (P > 0.05). Amino acid restriction reduced average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain:feed (G:F) linearly (linear P < 0.001). Similarly, ADG, ADFI, and G:F were linearly reduced with increased CaCl(2) inclusion (linear P < 0.001). ADG differed during the compensatory gain period (P < 0.001), with 4% CaCl(2)-fed pigs having a 47% increase in ADG compared with CON-fed pigs. Conversely, 15% and 25% NDF-fed pigs had reduced ADG compared with CON-fed pigs during the compensatory gain period. Gain efficiency differed from day 28 to 35 (P < 0.001), with 4% CaCl(2)-fed pigs having a 36% increase in G:F compared with CON-fed pigs. Altogether, these data demonstrate that both amino acid restriction and CaCl(2) inclusion are effective at slowing pig growth, albeit at greater inclusion rates.","output":"Evaluation of increased fiber, decreased amino acids, or decreased electrolyte balance as dietary approaches to slow finishing pig growth rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, there has been a widespread assumption that most infected persons are asymptomatic. A frequently-cited early study from China suggested that 86% of all infections were undocumented, which was used as indirect evidence that patients were asymptomatic. Using data from the most recent wave of the EPICOVID19 study, a nationwide household-based survey including 133 cities from all states of Brazil, we estimated the proportion of people with and without antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic, which symptoms were most frequently reported, the number of symptoms reported and the association between symptomatology and socio-demographic characteristics. We were able to test 33,205 subjects using a rapid antibody test that was previously validated. Information on symptoms was collected before participants received the test result. Out of 849 (2.7%) participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, only 12.1% (95%CI 10.1-14.5) reported no symptoms since the start of the pandemic, compared to 42.2% (95%CI 41.7-42.8) among those who tested negative. The largest difference between the two groups was observed for changes in smell or taste (56.5% versus 9.1%, a 6.2-fold difference). Symptoms change in smell or taste, fever and myalgia were most likely to predict positive test results as suggested by recursive partitioning tree analysis. Among individuals without any of these three symptoms (74.2% of the sample), only 0.8% tested positive, compared to 18.3% of those with both fever and changes in smell or taste.

For many, the special circumstances brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and related counter measures led to required transformations in incumbent practices. While all sectors were impacted during 2020, manufacturing industries experienced unique challenges due to supply shortages and shutdowns of production plants. This research focuses in studying the external communications of manufacturing companies. Social media platforms have emerged as channels for company communications, and Twitter as a focal one for less than formal communication. Companies activity on this platform during challenging times arises as meaningful for identifying latent signals on the developments in industries. Hence, Twitter activity of 18 most traded Finnish manufacturing companies in Helsinki Stock Exchange during 2020 is studied. In total, 4 915 tweets and their contents were analyzed. Frequently used words and n-grams are reflected with the financial performance of said companies and developments of Covid-19 pandemic during that year. The overall activity is observed to somewhat correlate with the recorded Covid-19 infections, however, number of tweets was lower than in 2019. Also, activity seems to follow official statements and set preventing measures concerning the virus. Content analysis of tweets reveals that Covid-19 was frequent topic in the studied companies external communications.

In this article, we monitor people's running activities during COVID-19 pandemic with a seismic sensor in a park in Singapore. We compare the spectra of natural and urban events in the recorded seismic data. For each 3 s seismic data, we define hierarchical screening criteria to identify footsteps based on the spectrum of the signal and its envelope. We derive the cadence of each runner by detecting the primary frequency of the footstep signals. The resulting algorithm achieves higher accuracy and higher temporal resolution for weak and overlapping signals compared to existing methods. Runner statistics based on four-month long seismic data show that urban running activities have clear daily and weekly cycles. Lockdown measures to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic promoted running activities, particularly over the weekends.

While economic shutdowns save lives, their large economic costs have caused some people to develop strong attitudes and even break government-issued mandates, which incurs health risks and often the need to extend the economic shutdowns. In the current article, we argue that the interaction of two personality characteristics, risk-taking tendencies and prosocial tendencies, is a strong determinant of attitudes toward economic shutdowns, and we assess the impact of this interaction on three different attitudes toward economic shutdowns that differ by their focal target: employees, customers, and organizations. The results demonstrate that this interaction significantly predicted economic shutdown attitudes toward customers and organizations but not employees. We suggest that these results can be understood via the lens of behavioral decision-making theories as well as a recent framework on antisocial risk takers, both of which provide several subsequent directions for future research.

METHODS: A 17-item electronic survey was sent to 496 undergraduate dental students and 53 clinical faculty members who attended clinical sessions during the outbreak period. The survey explored various aspects related to primary sources and prevention of disease exposure, dental management of suspected cases, impact of COVID-19 on students' clinical performance and effects of suspension of educational activities on academic performance and clinical competence. RESULTS: The response rate of the students' was 60.7% (n = 301). The majority of students reported that performing clinical work during the outbreak posed significant health concerns, resulted in a significant stress and negatively affected their clinical performance. The majority of students believed that aerosols generated during dental procedures are the major source for disease exposure and universal protective equipment is not effective for prevention. The decision to suspend teaching activities was supported by 89% of the students. Opinions were divided regarding the impact of the suspension on the academic performance and clinical competence. Educational videos were the most preferred form of distance education. The response rate of faculty members was 60.4% (n = 32). Responses of faculty members were similar to students, though fewer concerns were reported regarding the risk of disease transmission. All respondents agreed that extra-precautionary measures are required to ensure optimum protection against disease exposure.

Methods New user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and US). RA patients aged 18+ and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared to those initiating sulfasalazine (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30-day) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation, and hospitalization for psychosis.

This case report describes the presentation and clinical course of a cancer survivor who became critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone; however, he remained febrile, hypoxemic, continued to require full mechanical ventilator support and his chest X-ray showed increased bilateral infiltrates. The patient was treated with tocilizumab, after which he improved and was successfully extubated. This report illustrates a possible role of tocilizumab in management of cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Weather the Cytokine Storm: A Report of Successful Management of a Colon Cancer Survivor and a Critically Ill Patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Several threatening infectious diseases, including influenza, Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19, have affected human society over the past decades These disease outbreaks naturally inspire a demand for sustained and advanced safety and suppression measures To protect public health and safety, further research developments on emergency analysis methods and approaches for effective emergency treatment generation are urgently needed to mitigate the severity of the pandemic and save lives Methods: To address these issues, a novel case-based reasoning (CBR) system is proposed using three phases In the first phase, the similarity between the current case and the historical cases is calculated under a variety of heterogeneous information In the second phase, a filter approach based on grey clustering analysis is created to retrieve relevant cases In the third phase, the cases retrieved are taken as initial host nests in a cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and our system searches an optimal solution through iteration of this algorithm Results: The proposed model is compared with a CBR method improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a CBR method improved by a differential evolution algorithm (DE), to confirm the efficiency of our CS algorithm in adapting solutions for public health emergencies The results show that the proposed model is better than the existing algorithms Conclusion: The proposed model improves the speed of case retrieval using grey clustering and increases solution accuracy with CS algorithms The present research can contribute to government, CDC, and infectious disease emergency management fields with regard to the implementation of fast and accurate public biohazard prevention and control measures based on a variety of heterogeneous information","output":"Novel Case-Based Reasoning System for Public Health Emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the success of transitioning a support group for adults who have sustained a concussion from an in-person meeting to a virtual platform due to the impact of COVID-19.

The seroprevalence of each assay was summarized at both the survey periods. The proportion of seropositive individuals in the CLIA for each survey period and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Central Fukushima were then compared. We chose 515 participants for the analysis. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in CLIA increased from 0.19% in May to 0.39% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 0.97% in May to 0.39% in October. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in the rapid kit test decreased from 7.96% in May to 3.50% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 7.77% in May to 2.14% in October. The IgG and IgM antibody seroprevalence among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima decreased; the seroprevalence among hospital staff was consistent with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central Fukushima area. Although it is difficult to interpret the results of the antibody assay in a population with a low prior probability, constant follow-up surveys of antibody titers among hospital staff had several merits in obtaining a set of criteria regarding the accuracy of measures against COVID-19 and estimating the COVID-19 infection status among hospital staff.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima, Japan: a historical cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pervasive healthcare System or healthcare to anyone, anytime, and anywhere can be envisioned using the recent advanced technologies such as sensing technology, wireless communication, service oriented computing, and cloud computing by removing location, time, and other restraints while increasing both the coverage and the quality In this paper, we present a remote pervasive health monitoring system architecture based on cloud computing and service oriented architecture The underlying system is expected to permit providing desirable and appropriate healthcare services ubiquitously To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, a case study for remote monitoring of multi patients with COVID-19 is presented ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Design of Remote Pervasive Health Monitoring System based on Cloud Computing and SOA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on an in-depth survey of the literature, the purpose of the paper is to explore post-traumatic stress disorder, extreme anxiety, and depressive symptoms in frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic Using and replicating data from ACHA, BMA, CMA, Commonwealth Fund, GWI, Harvard Medical School, HMN, IASC, MHA, Rek et al (2020), Statista, and UNC School of Medicine, we performed analyses and made estimates regarding the psychological stress, anxiety and depression levels of frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 epidemic Descriptive statistics of compiled data from the completed surveys were calculated when appropriate","output":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Extreme Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms in Frontline Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have been publishing real-time forecasts of confirmed cases and deaths for COVID-19 from mid-March 2020 onwards, published at www.doornik.com/COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019C2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe (Hyalomma spp.) and the USA (Haemaphysalis longicornis), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion.

It demonstrates how capital, culture and governance have combined to reproduce London, within a frame of relational geographies and historical relayering. Emphasis is placed on the sequences of political change, capital intensification, industrial restructuring and cultural infusions which have transformed space in London since the 1980s. Tom Hutton contributes to the rich discourse on London's experiences of urbanization, by producing a fresh perspective on its development saliency. Millennial Metropolis includes a systematic review and synthesis of research literatures on globalizing cities, with reference to the reproduction of space at the metropolitan, district and neighbourhood scales. Hutton offers a nuanced treatment of geographical scale, observed in the blending of global/transnational processes with the fine-grained imprint of governance processes and social relations. These proccesses are manifested in sites of innovation, spectacle and social conviviality, but also produce experiences of displacement and inequality. The author presents a spatial model of metropolitan development by exploring how growth and change in twenty-first-century London is expressed internally as an enlarged zonal structure extending beyond the traditional territories of central and inner London. Serious threats to London are discussed -from the isolating implications of Brexit, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the dire threat of ecological crises and deteriorating public health associated with climate change.

Radiofrequency is known to reduce adipose tissue, whereas HIFEM treatment is effective for muscle definition. The authors investigated the efficacy of a novel device delivering synchronized radiofrequency and HIFEM treatment simultaneously for abdominal toning and fat reduction. METHODS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled and randomly divided into active (n = 48; age, 45.5  13.0 years) and sham groups (n = 24; age, 44.6  12.3 years). Both groups received three treatments on the abdomen once a week. The intensity in the active group was set to maximum tolerable level; in the sham group, the intensities were set to 5 percent. Ultrasound images were taken before treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment to examine changes in subcutaneous fat and rectus abdominis muscle thickness. Digital photographs were taken, and satisfaction and therapy comfort were assessed. RESULTS: Ultrasound images of the active group at 1 month showed significant (p < 0.05) reduction in adipose tissue thickness by 20.5 percent (4.8  2.6 mm), whereas rectus abdominis muscle thickness increased by 21.5 percent (2.0  0.8 mm). Results at 3 months improved to 28.3 percent (7.6  3.7 mm) and 24.2 percent (2.3  0.9 mm), respectively. Improvements were maintained at 6 months after treatment in the active group, whereas the sham group showed no significant changes. Treatments were found to be comfortable. The active group showed higher satisfaction with outcomes. CONCLUSION: Active treatment utilizing simultaneous application of radiofrequency and HIFEM therapy resulted in a significant increase in rectus abdominis thickness and subcutaneous fat reduction, exceeding previously published results for separate HIFEM and radiofrequency treatments.

Chart reviews were conducted to determine coronavirus disease history and hospitalizations, demographic information, procedure details, and 30-day admissions. RESULTS: A total of 3,762 patients underwent ambulatory procedures. Of those, 53 were previously diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 but recovered and tested negative at preprocedural testing. Of the 3,709 asymptomatic patients, 37 (1.00%) tested positive during preprocedural testing; 21 patients had their procedures delayed on average 28.6 days until testing negative, while 16 had their procedures performed before testing negative owing to the time sensitivity of the procedure. There were no major complications or 30-day admissions in any of these asymptomatic patients. Three patients tested positive for coronavirus disease after having an ambulatory procedure.

Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 95% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (845% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775-181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398-130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564-215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 154%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 438%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 825% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 g haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

Evidence regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on psychological distress has been widely reported worldwide, and one of the primary concerns regarding psychological distress is fear (ie, fear of COVID-19). Therefore, having a robust instrument for assessing fear of COVID-19 is important. The present systematic review aimed to synthesize the psychometric evidence evaluated using item response theory (IRT) on the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Methods Utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, four academic databases (Scopus, PubMed Central, ProQuest, and ISI Web of Knowledge) were used to search target papers. Keywords used for search were Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its abbreviation (ie, FCV-19S) and IRT-related terms. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was then applied to evaluate the methodological quality of the reviewed papers. Moreover, psychometric properties using IRT methods were synthesized using a qualitative method. Results The initial search resulted in 552 papers (73 duplicates) and 479 were screened based on their titles and s. Finally, 16 papers were included for review regarding their methodological quality (via COSMIN) to synthesize the psychometric evidence for FCV-19S. The 16 papers included 21 countries with 16 language versions of FCV-19S. Conclusion All the psychometric evidence indicated that the seven items in the FCV-19S fit with the concept of fear. The FCV-19S is a strong and valid instrument for assessing fear across different languages. The seven items in the FCV-19S appear to be unidimensional in assessing fear, which indicates that all items are necessary in the FCV-19S.","output":"Item Response Theory Analysis of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have emerged in the Nigerian market, and if used without supervision, may have damaging effects on the physical and mental health of users. Therefore, there is a need to determine the patterns of use, especially among adolescents and young adults. This study aims to assess the prevalence and factors associated with electronic cigarette use, as well as the relationship between their use and anxiety among adolescents and young adults in Lagos, Nigeria. METHOD: An online cross-sectional study among participants aged between 15C35 years. The survey had three sections: sociodemographic information, the pattern of e-cigarette use, and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with e-cigarette use. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using STATA-15.0 software. RESULTS: Data from a total of 949 respondents was analysed. Participants had a mean age of 23.36 years (3.97) and were predominantly female (55.64%). The prevalence of e-cigarette ever-use was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.8,10.0). Older age and being male were independently associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. After adjusting for age and sex, alcohol use (p<0.001), friends use (p<0.001), and other tobacco product or substance use (p:0.05) remained significantly associated with higher odds of e-cigarette use. There was no association between anxiety levels and e-cigarette use. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a higher likelihood of e-cigarette use among alcohol consumers, poly-tobacco or substance users and individuals with friends who use e-cigarettes. Health providers and policy makers in Nigeria might consider preventive measures aimed at young adults with the identified risk factors, as well as close monitoring of trends in e-cigarette use in the coming years.","output":"Electronic cigarette use among adolescents and young adults in Nigeria: Prevalence, associated factors and patterns of use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 Pandemic happens all over the world.

METHODS Participants (n = 72) with overweight or obesity who had children 2 to 12 years of age living in the home were randomly assigned to a group that used simplified dietary self-monitoring of high-calorie foods (Simplified) or a group that tracked calories (Standard). Both groups received a wireless scale, Fitbit trackers, and a 6-month intervention delivered via a smartphone application with lessons, text messages, and weekly personalized feedback messages. RESULTS Percentage weight loss at 6 months was 5.7% (95% CI: -8.3% to -3.2%) in the Standard group and 4.0% (95% CI: -5.7% to -2.3%) in the Simplified group, which was not significantly different. Similar proportions reached 5% weight loss at 6 months (43.2% in Standard and 42.9% in Simplified). There were no differences in number of dietary tracking days or change in average daily caloric intake between groups. CONCLUSIONS Two mobile-delivered weight loss interventions produced clinically meaningful levels of weight loss at 6 months, with no differences in dietary tracking adherence or dietary intake.

METHODS: We collected questionnaire data on sleep apnea risk, insomnia, and general sleep patterns. We used an adjusted multivariate Poisson regression to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between these SP and metastatic versus localized cancer stage (M1 vs. M0), and adjusted logistic regression models to calculate ORs for associations between SP with the number of ICI infusions completed (6 + vs. < 6). RESULTS: Among 32 patients who received ICI treatment, the prevalence of low, intermediate, and high-risk OSA risk was 36%, 42%, and 21%, respectively. Overall, 58% of participants reported clinically significant insomnia. We did not find a significant association between intermediate or high risk OSA (vs. low risk) and metastatic cancer status (PR = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.28, 3.67)). Patients in the cohort who reported taking > 15 min to fall asleep were 3.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic cancer compared to those reporting shorter sleep latency (95% CI (1.74, 7.35)). We did not find a significant association between SP and number of ICI infusions completed. CONCLUSION: Our data associating sleep apnea risk, insomnia, and sleep patterns with more advanced cancer encourages further exploration in larger-scale observational studies and suggests interventional clinical trials focused on sleep quality improvement that could result in better outcomes for these patients.

METHODS The databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science-Direct, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to December 2019. Articles that published as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and full-text articles published in English or other languages were included and participants were primi or multigravida women who were in active phase of labor. The intervention included HBB compared to placebo (normal saline) that was used during active phase of labor. Pooled estimates were measured using the fixed or random effect model, while the overall effect was reported in a mean difference (MD). All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS Twenty studies involving 3108 women were included in meta-analysis. Based on subgroup analysis by parity, use of HBB significantly reduced the duration of the first stage of labor in primigravida women (MD = - 57.73; 95% CI: [- 61.48, - 53.60]) and in multigravida women (MD = - 90.74; 95% CI: [- 97.24, - 84.24]). Administering HBB could reduce the second stages of labor in primigravidas and multigravidas about 6 min and 4 min respectively. Also, HBB reduced the duration of the third stage of labor in multigravidas about 3 min. APGAR score at one and 5 min after birth was not affected. The main maternal adverse effect was tachycardia and dry mouth. Labor duration in studies in which the participants were primi-and multigravida was not presented based on separate parities except for four papers, and the route of HBB administration was not the same across all studies. CONCLUSIONS Although, the effect of HBB was minimal when multigravidas and primigravidas women were considered together, the HBB was clinically effective in primigravida and multigravida women for shortening the first and the second stages of labor.

We investigated the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and sociodemographic factors in Barcelona at a fine-grained geography. METHODS: This cross-sectional ecological study is based on 10 550 confirmed cases of COVID-19 registered during the first wave in the municipality of Barcelona (population 1.64 million). We considered 16 variables on the demographic structure, urban density, household conditions, socioeconomic status, mobility and health characteristics for 76 geographical units of analysis (neighbourhoods), using a lasso analysis to identify the most relevant variables. We then fitted a multivariate Quasi-Poisson model that explained the COVID-19 incidence by neighbourhood in relation to these variables. RESULTS: Neighbourhoods with: (1) greater population density, (2) an aged population structure, (3) a high presence of nursing homes, (4) high proportions of individuals who left their residential area during lockdown and/or (5) working in health-related occupations were more likely to register a higher number of cases of COVID-19. Conversely, COVID-19 incidence was negatively associated with (6) percentage of residents with post-secondary education and (7) population born in countries with a high Human Development Index. CONCLUSION: Like other historical pandemics, the incidence of COVID-19 is associated with neighbourhood sociodemographic factors with a greater burden faced by already deprived areas. Because urban social and health injustices already existed in those geographical units with higher COVID-19 incidence in Barcelona, the current pandemic is likely to reinforce both health and social inequalities, and urban environmental injustice all together.","output":"Sociodemographic determinants of intraurban variations in COVID-19 incidence: the case of Barcelona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a review of all the experimental and clinical studies performed in the last 60 years on the antiviral activity of inactivated Corynebacterium parvum (Cutibacterium acnes).

According to clinical routine, these indexes are measured manually by radiologists with limited computer support. This process is time consuming and potentially subjected to inaccuracy and individual variability in measurements. Moreover, the existing indexes have limitations, since they are based on linear measurements performed on single slices rather than on volumetric data derived from all the thoracic scans. RESULTS: In this paper we present an image processing pipeline aimed at providing radiologists with a computer-aid tool in support of diagnosis of PE patients developed in MATLAB? and conceived for MRI images. This framework has a dual purpose: (i) to automatize computation of clinical indexes with a view to ease and standardize pre-operative evaluation; (ii) to propose a new marker of pathological severity based on volumetric analysis and overcoming the limitations of existing axial slice-based indexes. Final designed framework is semi-automatic, requiring some user interventions at crucial steps: this is realized through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that simplifies the interaction between the user and the tools. We tested our pipeline on 50 pediatric patients from Gaslini Children's Hospital and performed manual computation of indexes, comparing the results between the proposed tool and gold-standard clinical practice. Automatic indexes provided by our algorithm have shown good agreement with manual measurements by two independent readers. Moreover, the new proposed Volumetric Correction Index (VCI) has exhibited good correlation with standardized markers of pathological severity, proving to be a potential innovative tool for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our pipeline represents an innovative image processing in PE evaluation, based on MRI images (radiation-free) and providing the clinician with a quick and accurate tool for automatically calculating the classical PE severity indexes and a new more comprehensive marker: the Volumetric Correction Index.","output":"A new tool for assessing Pectus Excavatum by a semi-automatic image processing pipeline calculating the classical severity indexes and a new marker: the Volumetric Correction Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 convalescent plasma, particularly plasma with high-titer SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibodies, is one of the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity.

A total of 22 studies originated from EU, 90 from Far East, 16 from Middle East, and 30 from America. Data were synthesised with mixed heterogeneity across outcomes. Pooled results highlighted that patients with diabetes were at a higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality, OR 1.87 [95%CI 1.61, 2.17]. ICU admissions were increased across all studies for patients with diabetes, OR 1.59 [95%CI 1.15, 2.18], a result that was mainly skewed by Far East-originating studies, OR 1.94 [95%CI 1.51, 2.49].

Methods This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September 2020. Participants were recruited through an online survey instrument promoted through social media. Respondents self-reported their sexual behaviours and levels of sexual satisfaction prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic movement control measures. Results We recruited a total of 562 participants, of whom 338 (60.1%) ever had a sexual experience. Singles (n=106, 31.4%) and those not living with their partners (n=115, 34.0%) reported a greater decrease in partnered sexual activities but a greater increase in individual sexual activities such as masturbation, sending and receiving nudes and watching pornography, relative to those who were living with their partners (n=117, 34.6%).

DESIGN: Community-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: The UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 421 372 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive as of 1 January 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was CVD-related death, which was defined as death with CVD as a cause in the death register. We retrieved information on hospitalisations with CVD as the primary diagnosis from the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. The study period was 1 January 2020 to June 30 2020, and we used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period. In order to control for seasonal variations and ageing of the study population, standardised mortality/incidence ratios (SMRs/SIRs) with 95% CIs were used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with the reference period. RESULTS: We observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020, compared with the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of CVD-related deaths (n=218) was almost double in April, compared with the expected number (n=120) (SMR=1.82, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.07). In addition, we observed a significant decline in CVD-related hospitalisations from March onwards, with the lowest SIR observed in April (0.45, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.49).

The most commonly known role of vitamin D is its participation in regulation of calcium-phosphate metabolism and bone mineralization. This role is crucial in the prevention of rickets in children and osteoporosis in the elderly. In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D. Proper vitamin D levels in blood have a positive effect on overall health, thus reducing the risk of many diseases. Vitamin D plays, inter alia, a positive role in some diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (inflammatory bowel disease), nervous system (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease), and cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis). Additionally, its positive protective effect in the case of neoplastic and immunological diseases has been noted. Some studies also confirm the relationship of vitamin D deficiency to obesity and depression. In the event of these diseases, it is possible to prevent disease and support the process of treatment by maintaining appropriate levels of 25(OH)D in the blood. Besides, sufficient blood vitamin D levels reduces the risk of developing respiratory tract infections and suppresses cytokine storm, which is responsible for most COVID-19 deaths.

AIM: To provide detailed insights and understanding into service changes and innovation that occurred in UK primary care to deliver end-of-life care during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: United Kingdom survey of general practitioners and community nurses, circulated via regional and national professional networks. RESULTS: A total of 559 valid responses were received from 387 community nurses, 156 general practitioners and 16 other. Over a third of respondents (n = 224; 40.8%) experienced changes in the organisation of their team in order to provide end-of-life care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three qualitative themes were identified: COVID-19 as a catalyst for change in primary palliative care; new opportunities for more responsive and technological ways of working; and pandemic factors that improved and strengthened interprofessional collaboration.

RECENT FINDINGS Chronic lung disease was the most common comorbidity in hospitalized PWH in New York and second-most common condition in ambulatory PWH in Canada. The elevated risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in PWH has been widely recognized, but PWH are also at higher risk for asthma and worse asthma outcomes. Expanded assessments of lung structure and function, such as single-breath diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and chest computed tomography (CT) have provided new insights into HIV effects on the lungs. New biomarker analyses are emerging, but further studies are needed to validate predictive biomarkers for chronic lung disease in PWH. Clinical trials addressing chronic lung disease in PWH are few in number. SUMMARY Chronic lung disease is a common and high-impact comorbidity among PWH. Future studies should collect more comprehensive lung assessments such as DLCO, FeNO, and chest CT in order to better phenotype lung derangements in HIV. Clinical trials are desperately needed to reduce the rising burden of chronic lung disease in PWH.","output":"Recent advances in HIV-associated chronic lung disease clinical research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While mass-scale vaccination campaigns are ongoing worldwide, genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical to monitor the emergence and global spread of viral variants of concern (VOC).

We benchmark COVseq against a standard library preparation method (NEBNext) on 29 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, reaching 95.4% of concordance between single-nucleotide variants detected by both methods. Application of COVseq to 245 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive samples demonstrates the ability of the method to reliably detect emergent VOC as well as its compatibility with downstream phylogenetic analyses. A cost analysis shows that COVseq could be used to sequence thousands of samples at less than 15 USD per sample, including library preparation and sequencing costs.

Holistic and unbiased analyses of 17 immune cell-types were conducted on 1,075 peripheral blood samples obtained from 868 COVID-19 patients and on samples from 24 patients presenting with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections and 36 healthy donors. Immune profiles of COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those of age-matched healthy donors but generally similar to those of patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Positivity was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively by proper statistical approaches with strong testing power. Viral shedding in respiratory tract and faecal specimens was prolonged to 45 and 40 days after the last exposure, respectively. The overall positive rate in respiratory tract specimens was low and relatively unstable, being higher in the early-to-mid stage than in the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. Compared with respiratory tract specimens, faecal samples had a higher viral load, higher overall positive rate, and more stable positivity in different disease courses and varied symptomatic status. Faecal specimens have the potential ability to surpass respiratory tract specimens in virus detection. Testing of faecal specimens in diagnosis, especially for identifying asymptomatic carriers, is recommended. Simultaneously, testing respiratory tract specimens at the early-to-mid stage is better than testing at the mid-to-late stage of the disease course.

In this study, we postulated that an analysis of exosome-enriched maternal plasma could provide a more focused and applicable approach for diagnosing HDP earlier in pregnancy. Therefore, the peripheral blood plasma of 24 pregnant women (11 controls, 13 HDP) was collected between 20th and 24th gestational weeks and centrifuged for exosome enrichment.

We report vital findings using the pooled mean group estimator and accounting for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity among the countries. First, results show that renewable energy negatively impacts carbon emissions in both the short and long runs, while non-renewable energy positively impacts pollution. In addition, the results show that capital investment lowers pollution in the short run but increases it in the long run. Lastly, on interacting capital investment with renewable energy, we find that pollution falls in both the short and long runs, while its interaction with non-renewable energy expands pollution in both periods. On the policy front, since capital investment provides an important channel to reduce pollution in G20 nations, it is therefore recommended that if energy consumption is to work through the capital investment channel to lower pollution in the G20, the proportion of renewable energy must increase relative to non-renewable energy in their energy mix.","output":"Heterogeneous analysis of pollution abatement via renewable and non-renewable energy: lessons from investment in G20 nations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is associated with hypertension and brain blood flow dysregulation, which are major risk factors for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Structural remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, or hypercontractility of resistance vessels may cause increased total peripheral resistance and hypertension. Recent studies showed that G protein- and RhoA/Rho-kinase pathways are involved in increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and arterial tone in middle-aged mice. We aimed to characterize the age-dependent changes in the vascular proteome in normal laboratory mice using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analyses on middle cerebral arteries and mesenteric resistance arteries from young (3 months) vs. middle-aged (14 months) mice. In total, 31 proteins were significantly affected by age whereas 172 proteins were differentially expressed by vessel type. Hierarchical clustering revealed that 207 proteins were significantly changed or clustered by age. Vitamin B6 pathway, Biosynthesis of antibiotics, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton and Endocytosis were the top enriched KEGG pathways by age. Several proteins in the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway changed in a manner consistent with hypertension and dysregulation of cerebral perfusion. Although aging had a less profound effect on the resistance artery proteome than on vessel type, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, including the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, is an important target for age-dependent hypertension.","output":"Effect of age on the vascular proteome in middle cerebral arteries and mesenteric resistance arteries in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pilot study was performed to evaluate the safety and serological responses after co-administration of two multivalent inactivated vaccines to pregnant cattle One vaccine was directed against bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and contained antigens of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza 3 virus (PI3) and Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) The second vaccine targeted neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) and was composed of inactivated antigens of bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and E coli The use of these combinations have been used more and more by veterinary practitioners as there exist some clear evidence that both vaccines improves the passive protection via the colostrum for the relevant pathogens However, up until now, no safety or efficacy data has been available concerning such co-administrations The safety of both vaccines and the serological responses to the BRD vaccine has been evaluated when used at the same time, but without mixing and compared to the responses to the administration of each vaccine independently There was no evidence of any negative effect on calving or calf health in any of the vaccinated animals The antibody levels against BRSV and Mh in the sera of the calves from cows vaccinated with both vaccines were not significantly different from the levels in the sera of calves vaccinated with the BRD vaccine alone The results from this pilot study demonstrated that the co-administration of the two multivalent inactivated vaccines had no detrimental effect on the safety or serological responses to the BRD vaccine compared to the independent use of the vaccines","output":"The Effect of Co-Administration of Inactivated Vaccines against Bovine Respiratory Disease and Neonatal Calf Diarrhoea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses' lifestyle habits play a key role in promoting healthy lifestyles; although, they may not always be entirely healthy and can be influenced by working conditions.

Since then, the world has faced multiple flares. In March 2021, the third wave hit Tunisia, resulting in a total of 331 674 confirmed cases and 12 089 Covid-19 related deaths (on May 19th, 2021). Among these reported cases, >6000 were children under the age of 18. Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases undergoing immunosuppressive treatment are considered immunocompromised. Therefore, it is only fair to question whether children suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are specially at risk during this pandemic. Our objective was to assess the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic on patients with JIA. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including patients with JIA, all fulfilling the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. We prepared a questionnaire evaluating the clinical data of our patients during the outbreak. We asked whether the child had been infected with the virus or whether he had contact histories with confirmed cases, and if so, had the child developed any symptoms (such as fever, respiratory, digestive or osteoarticular symptoms, myalgia, asthenia) or required any specific care. For all patients, we collected the following data: age, age of onset, the duration of the disease, JIA subtype, and the current treatment. RESULTS: We included 25 JIA patients, mean age at disease onset was 7.6 +/- 3.8 years [1C11]. Among them, 17 were female. The mean duration of the disease was 4.9 +/- 3 years [0C15]. Three patients were on biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and six on conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Sixteen patients had no background treatment. None of the children had a positive PCR test nor symptoms suggestive of Covid-19. There were only 2 children with contact histories with confirmed cases: one with his cousin and one with his grandfather. Both patients were on NSAIDS with no DMARDS, and both followed social distancing rules. Neither one of them developed any symptoms. There have been no reports of absenteeism from school or medical checkups or disruption of treatment due to this pandemic, outside of the government-imposed lockdown period. CONCLUSION: None of our patients contracted the corona virus or developed any symptoms, during the deadliest wave in Tunisia to date. These results align with different research and the hypothesis that children with JIA under treatment do not have an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 compared with healthy children. Our study, however, had its limitations due to the small number of patients. Further research with larger sample size are, therefore, required.","output":"P025 Risk assessment of covid 19 in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic forced rapid adoption of telemedicine for care of neurology patients.

Methods: This was a retrospective, nonrandomized, case series study of telemedicine-based neurological management in an urban academic medical center from October 2018 to June 2020. We estimated roundtrip travel time, roundtrip travel distance, total savings, and surveyed patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine care. We supported these findings through evaluation of 7,194 patients by telemedicine and conducted 9,189 video visits for neurological care. Results: The median telemedicine patient avoided a roundtrip driving distance of 33 miles and roundtrip travel time of 75 min. Within sample, median hourly earnings were $27/h. The median patient saved $18 on fuel and parking and $36 of time-based opportunity savings, for total savings of $54 per video visit.

Antibodies to Bacillus piliformis were detectable in about 50% of rat stocks screened. This is in contrast to the mouse, where only about 10% of the colonies were found to be positive. A similar picture was seen for M. pulmonis which is primarily an infection of the rat. In mice no case was detected during the last two years. The number of investigations performed from guineapig, hamster and rabbit colonies was relatively low. Nevertheless, antibodies against the following antigens were detectable: In guineapig stocks: Reo3, PVM, Sendai, Simian virus 5 (SV5) and B. piliformis; in rabbits: Reo3, Sendavirus, SV5, and B. piliformis; in hamsters: PVM, LCM and B. piliformis.

Hybrid bacteriocins may be obtained in several ways. In our laboratory, by combining enterocin CRL35 and microcin V (Ent35-MccV), we obtained a broad-spectrum peptide that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ent35-MccV is sensitive to the action of intestinal proteases and is heat resistant, which makes it a good candidate for use as a biopreservative. For this reason, the peptide was tested in skim milk and beef burgers as food models.

RESULTS: Triku is a feature selection method that favors genes defining the main cell populations. It does so by selecting genes expressed by groups of cells that are close in the k-nearest neighbor graph. The expression of these genes is higher than the expected expression if the k-cells were chosen at random. Triku efficiently recovers cell populations present in artificial and biological benchmarking datasets, based on adjusted Rand index, normalized mutual information, supervised classification, and silhouette coefficient measurements. Additionally, gene sets selected by triku are more likely to be related to relevant Gene Ontology terms and contain fewer ribosomal and mitochondrial genes.

Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost. Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are needed.","output":"COVID-19 and the Social Distancing Paradox: dangers and solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of the autonomic nervous system provides an organizing principle to interpret the adaptive significance of physiological systems in promoting social behavior and responding to social challenges. This phylogenetic shift in neural regulation of the autonomic nervous system in mammals has produced a neuroanatomically integrated social engagement system, including neural mechanisms that regulate both cardiac vagal tone and muscles involved in vocalization. Mammalian vocalizations are part of a conspecific social communication system, with several mammalian species modulating acoustic features of vocalizations to signal affective state. Prosody, defined by variations in rhythm and pitch, is a feature of mammalian vocalizations that communicate emotion and affective state. While the covariation between physiological state and the acoustic frequencies of vocalizations is neurophysiologically based, few studies have investigated the covariation between vocal prosody and autonomic state. In response to this paucity of scientific evidence, the current study explored the utility of vocal prosody as a sensitive index of autonomic activity in human infants during the Still Face challenge. Overall, significant correlations were observed between several acoustic features of the infant vocalizations and autonomic state, demonstrating an association between shorter heart period and reductions in heart period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia following the challenge with the dampening of the modulation of acoustic features (fundamental frequency, variance, 50% bandwidth, and duration) that are perceived as prosody.","output":"The covariation of acoustic features of infant cries and autonomic state."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response brought forth major changes in innovation policy.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for both patients and caregivers. Many laboratory markers have been used to better understand the causes of poor outcomes and to improve the management of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 93 patients who had a positive polymerase chain reaction test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included in this study. Demographic features, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory findings were obtained from the hospital database retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups according to the disease severity as follows: mild group (n = 70) and severe group (n = 23). Results: The median age of the study population was 42.5 (28.3-62.8) with 69.9% male patients. Patients in the severe group were significantly older and showed a higher frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and heart failure in comparison with those in the mild group. In addition, gamma-glutamyl transferase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were higher whereas albumin level was lower in patients in the severe group.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the challenges associated with caring for a relative with dementia in LTC during the pandemic, as well as resources, strategies, and practices caregivers found helpful in coping with COVID-19. DESIGN: This study was conducted within the context of an ongoing randomized controlled trial of a psychosocial intervention to support caregivers. Open-ended survey responses (n = 125) and semistructured interviews with a subset of the sample (n = 20) collected between June 2020 and June 2021 explored caregivers' experiences during COVID-19. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 125 family caregivers of persons with dementia living in residential LTC. METHODS: Thematic analysis was used to identify themes capturing caregivers' experiences. RESULTS: In addition to concerns about COVID-19 infection, participants reported key challenges such as the difficulty of maintaining contact with relatives because of visiting restrictions, lack of information about relatives' health and well-being, worries about overburdened LTC staff, impossibility of returning relatives home from the LTC facility, and fears about relatives dying alone. Participants also identified resources, strategies, and practices that they perceived as helpful, including effective infection prevention within the LTC facility, good communication with LTC staff, and creative strategies for connecting with their relatives. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative analysis informs recommendations for practice within LTC facilities, as well as supports that may help caregivers manage stressful situations in the context of COVID-19. Vaccination and testing protocols should be implemented to maximize family caregivers' opportunities for in-person contact with relatives in LTC, as alternative visiting modalities were often unsatisfactory or unfeasible.

However, to date, there are no regimens to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is an urgent need to identify novel leads with anti-viral properties that impede viral pathogenesis in the host system. Esculentoside A (EsA), a saponin isolated from the root of Phytolacca esculenta, is known to exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, especially anti-inflammatory activity. To our knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter host cells. This is mediated through the proteins of SARS-CoV-2, especially the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain. Thus, our primary goal is to prevent virus replication and binding to the host, which allows us to explore the efficiency of EsA on key surface drug target proteins using the computational biology paradigm approach. Here, the anti-coronavirus activity of EsA in vitro and its potential mode of inhibitory action on the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. We found that EsA inhibited the HCoV-OC43 coronavirus during the attachment and penetration stage. Molecular docking results showed that EsA had a strong binding affinity with the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. The results of the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that EsA had higher stable binding with the spike protein. These results demonstrated that Esculentoside A can act as a spike protein blocker to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Considering the poor bioavailability and low toxicity of EsA, it is suitable as novel lead for the inhibitor against binding interactions of SARS-CoV-2 of S-protein and ACE2.","output":"A potential antiviral activity of Esculentoside A against binding interactions of SARS-COV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution to provide delivery and other mobile services to customers rapidly, yet it drains its stored energy quickly when travelling on the way and (even if solar-powered) it takes time for charging power on the way before reaching the destination. To address this issue, existing works focus more on UAV's path planning with designated system vehicles providing charging service. However, in some emergency cases and rural areas where system vehicles are not available, public trucks can provide more feasible and cost-saving services and hence a silver lining. In this paper, we explore how a single UAV can save flying distance by exploiting public trucks, to minimize the travel time of the UAV. We give the first theoretical work studying online algorithms for the problem, which guarantees a worst-case performance. We first consider the offline problem knowing future truck trip information far ahead of time. By delicately transforming the problem into a graph satisfying both time and power constraints, we present a shortest-path algorithm that outputs the optimal solution of the problem. Then, we proceed to the online setting where trucks appear in real-time and only inform the UAV of their trip information some certain time $\\\\Delta t$ beforehand. As a benchmark, we propose a well-constructed lower bound that an online algorithm could achieve. We propose an online algorithm MyopicHitching that greedily takes truck trips and an improved algorithm $\\\\Delta t$-Adaptive that further tolerates a waiting time in taking a ride.

However, evidence on its effects on healthcare access and health outcomes are scarce and the possible implications of using mobile money for financing and payment of maternal healthcare serviceswhich generally require large one-time out-of-pocket paymentshave not yet been systematically assessed in low-resource settings. The aim of this study is to determine the impact on health outcomes, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of mobile phone-based savings and payment service, the Mobile Maternal Health Wallet (MMHW), for skilled healthcare during pregnancy and delivery among women in Madagascar. METHODS: This is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation type-1 trial, determining the effectiveness of the intervention while evaluating the context of its implementation in Madagascars Analamanga region, containing the capital, Antananarivo. Using a stratified cluster randomized design, 61 public-sector primary-care health facilities were randomized within 6 strata to either receive the intervention or not (29 intervention vs. 32 control facilities). The strata were defined by a health facilitys antenatal care visit volume and its capacity to offer facility-based deliveries. The registered pre-specified primary outcomes are (i) delivery at a health facility, (ii) antenatal care visits, and (iii) total healthcare expenditure during pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal period. The registered pre-specified secondary outcomes include additional health outcomes, economic outcomes, and measurements of user experience and satisfaction. Our estimated enrolment number is 4600 women, who completed their pregnancy between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. A series of nested mixed-methods studies will elucidate client and provider perceptions on feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of the intervention to inform future implementation efforts. DISCUSSION: A cluster-randomized, hybrid effectiveness-implementation design allows for a robust approach to determine whether the MMHW is a feasible and beneficial intervention in a resource-restricted public healthcare environment.

These changes led to a decrease in patient volume, impacting physician trainee education due to lost clinical and didactic opportunities. We measured the prevalence of trainee concern over missed educational opportunities and investigated the risk factors leading to such concerns. METHODS: All residents and fellows at a large academic medical center were invited to participate in a web-based survey in May of 2020. Participants responded to questions regarding demographic characteristics, specialty, primary assigned responsibility during the previous 2 weeks (clinical, education, or research), perceived concern over missed educational opportunities, and burnout. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between missed educational opportunities and the measured variables. RESULTS: 22% (301 of 1375) of the trainees completed the survey. 47% of the participants were concerned about missed educational opportunities. Trainees assigned to education at home had 2.85 [95%CI 1.33-6.45] greater odds of being concerned over missed educational opportunities as compared with trainees performing clinical work. Trainees performing research were not similarly affected [aOR = 0.96, 95%CI (0.47-1.93)].

This retrospective cohort study included 254 patients (127 with diabetes and 127 without diabetes) who were admitted for COVID-19 to a tertiary hospital in Tehran, Iran, between February and May 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, radiological findings, and laboratory data, including data on AKI, hematuria, and proteinuria were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 254 patients, 142 (55.9%) were male and the mean ( SD) age was 65.7 years (12.5). In total, 58 patients (22.8%) developed AKI during hospitalization, of whom 36 patients had diabetes (p = 0.04); most patients (74.1%) had stage 1 or 2 AKI. Also, 8 patients (13.8%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT) after developing AKI. Regardless of diabetes status, patients who developed AKI had significantly higher mortality rates compared with patients who did not develop AKI (p = 0.02). Hematuria and proteinuria were observed in 38.1% and 55% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that invasive mechanical ventilation, proteinuria, HBA1c level, history of cardiovascular disease, and use of statins were independent risk factors for AKI development in patients with diabetes. CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that AKI develops in a considerable percentage of patients with COVID-19, especially in those with diabetes, and is significantly associated with mortality.","output":"Prevalence, Risk Factors and Outcomes Associated with Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Comparative Study between Diabetic and Nondiabetic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beyond their critical role in hemostasis, platelets physically interact with neutrophils to form neutrophil-platelet aggregates (NPAs), enhancing neutrophil effector functions during inflammation. NPAs may also promote disease worsening in various inflammatory diseases. However, characterization of NPAs in cancer remains totally unexplored. Using ImageStream?X (ISX) imaging flow cytometer, we were not only allowed able to detect CD15+ CD14- CD36+ ITGA2B+ NPAs in both healthy donors' (HDs) and cancer patients' bloods, but we also showed that NPAs result from the binding of platelets preferentially to low-density neutrophils (LDNs) as opposed to normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). By re-analyzing two independent public scRNAseq data of whole blood leukocytes from cancer patients and HDs, we could identify a subset of neutrophils with high platelet gene expression that may correspond to NPAs. Moreover, we showed that cancer patients' derived NPAs possessed a distinct molecular signature compared with the other neutrophil subsets, independently of platelet genes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of this NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature revealed a significant enrichment of neutrophil degranulation, chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration GO terms. Lastly, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we could show by multivariate Cox analysis that the NPAs-associated neutrophil transcriptomic signature was associated with a worse patient prognosis in several cancer types. These results suggest that neutrophils from NPAs are systemically primed by platelets empowering them with cancer progression capacities once at tumor site. NPAs may therefore hold clinical utility as novel non-invasive blood prognostic biomarker in cancer patients with solid tumors. This article is protected by copyright.

Based on these experiences, Ghana passed the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA) in 2011. Among the provisions in the PRMA were the creation of a Stabilization Fund to cushion the budget in case of lower than expected oil revenues, debt repayment, and contingency purposes. In addition, the Ghana Heritage Fund (GHF) was created to serve as an endowment for future generation. However, there have been debates in recent times on whether the GHF should be used to fund the Governments Free Senior High School or even to support the budget during the COVID-19 outbreak. So far, the government has not been successful in convincing civil society, the opposition in Parliament and academia on the need to use the GHF now.

This has become increasingly important in Europe to improve affordability and access to innovative therapies in areas of high-unmet need. This research aims to understand the rationale for collaboration across borders, outcomes of joint initiatives (and associated implications) and key success factors. Methods: A comprehensive review of cross-country collaborations was conducted with a focus on HTA, pricing, procurement, and patient management. Established collaboration models were prioritised including the Valetta Declaration, BeNeLuxA initiative, Nordic Pharmaceutical Forum, and FiNoSe. EU COVID-19 pricing and procurement agreements and cross-border healthcare initiatives in response to the pandemic were also reviewed. Results: Successful collaborations occur primarily at the HTA level to pool expertise for evaluation of high-cost, high-value therapies (e.g., Zolgensma by BeNeLuxA and Zynteglo by FiNoSe), however to date influence on access and reimbursement has been minimal. Furthermore, cross border collaboration for price negotiations have had limited success. Successful implementation requires alignment regarding processes and priorities between countries and active engagement from both payers and manufacturers;in this context smaller initiatives with fewer countries are more likely to achieve cross-market consensus. Conclusions: Collaborations are occurring more frequently to support evaluation of high-cost, high-value therapies and to provide a solution for emergency medical care where capacity in individual countries or regions is limited. With an increasing number of innovative therapies in late-stage clinical development, and support for voluntary member state collaborations at the European level, such initiatives are likely to increase in future to pool resources and address shared health priorities across markets. Increased collaboration may lead to further consolidation of evaluation frameworks for high-cost, high-value therapies, including the associated management of clinical and financial uncertainty (e.g., recently introduced EU joint HTA).","output":"POSA326 Cross-Border Collaboration to Support Pricing and Access for High-Cost, High-Value Therapies: A Review of Initiatives within Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proposed structures of parvistemoamide have been achieved by macrolactamization, but none of the characterization data of synthetic samples matched with those of the natural sample.

Pregnant women are more susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are at higher risk of preterm birth than uninfected pregnant women. Despite this evidence, the immunologic effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy remain understudied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among pregnant and nonpregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant (n=33) and nonpregnant (n=17) women who tested either positive (pregnant, 22; nonpregnant, 17) or negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (pregnant, 11) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We measured proinflammatory and placental cytokine messenger RNAs, neonatal Fc receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples. In addition, we evaluated antispike immunoglobulin G, antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G, and neutralizing antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in serum or plasma collected from nonpregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood. RESULTS: Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection expressed more interleukin-1 beta, but not interleukin 6, in blood samples collected within 14 days vs >14 days after performing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test. Pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection also had reduced antispike receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin G titers and were less likely to have detectable neutralizing antibody than nonpregnant women. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection did not disrupt neonatal Fc receptor expression in the placenta, maternal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neutralizing antibody was inhibited by infection during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 treatment in pregnancy. In addition, the long-term implications of placental inflammation for neonatal health require greater consideration.","output":"Pregnancy alters interleukin-1 beta expression and antiviral antibody responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with a range of respiratory complications.

Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV.

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV.

Surgical departments postponed all elective operative procedures and provided only essential surgical care to patients who presented with acute surgical conditions or suspected malignancy. Ample literature has emerged during this pandemic regarding the guidelines for safe surgical care. We report our experience during the lockdown period including the surgical procedures performed, the perioperative care provided, and the specific precautions implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Materials and Methods We extracted patient clinical data from the medical records of all surgical patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital between the March 24th, 2020 and May 31st, 2020. Data collected included: patient demographics, surgical diagnoses, surgical procedures, nonoperative management, and patient outcomes. Results Seventy-seven patients were included in this report: 23 patients were managed medically, 28 patients underwent a radiologic intervention, and 23 patients required an operative procedure. In total eight of the 77 patients died due to ongoing sepsis, multiorgan failure, or advanced malignancy. Conclusion During the COVID-19 lockdown period, our surgical team performed many lifesaving surgical procedures and appropriately selected cancer operations.

Diverse factors in atopic diseases affect the airway and gut microbiome structures, which are expected to negatively influence host health.

To validate the feasibility of pooling samples, serial dilution analysis and spike-in experiments were conducted using synthetic DNA and nucleic acids extracted from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative patients. Furthermore, we studied 1000 individuals, 667 of whom were healthy individuals (195 healthcare workers and 472 hospitalized patients with disorders other than COVID-19 infection), and 333 infection-suspected patients with cough and fever. Serial dilution analysis showed a limit of detection of around 10C100 viral genome copies according to the protocol of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Spike-in experiments demonstrated that RT-qPCR detected positive signals in pooled samples with SARS-CoV-2-negative and -positive patients at 5-, 10-, 20-fold dilutions. By screening with this pooling strategy, by the end of April 2020 there were 12 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in 333 infection-suspected patients (3.6%) and zero in 667 healthy controls. We obtained these results with a total of 538 runs using the pooling strategy, compared with 1000 standard runs. In a prospective study, we successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 using 10- to 20-fold diluted samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from eighteen COVID-19 patients with wide ranges of viral load. Pooling sample is feasible for conserving test reagents and detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings. This strategy will help us to research the prevalence infected individuals and provide infected-status information to prevent the spread of the virus and nosocomial transmission.","output":"Pooling RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in 1000 individuals of healthy and infection-suspected patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreaks caused by coronaviruses and their supposed potential fecal-oral transmission highlight the need for understanding the survival of infectious coronavirus in domestic sewers. To date, the survivability and decay of coronaviruses were predominately studied using small volumes of wastewater (normally 5C30 mL) in vials (in-vial tests). However, real sewers are more complicated than bulk wastewater (wastewater matrix only), in particular the presence of sewer biofilms and different operational conditions. This study investigated the decay of infectious human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), two typical surrogate coronaviruses, in laboratory-scale reactors mimicking the gravity (GS, gravity-driven sewers) and rising main sewers (RM, pressurized sewers) with and without sewer biofilms. The in-sewer decay of both coronaviruses was greatly enhanced in comparison to those reported in bulk wastewater through in-vial tests. 99% of HCoV-229E and FIPV decayed within 2 h under either GS or RM conditions with biofilms, in contrast to 6C10 h without biofilms. There is limited difference in the decay of HCoV and FIPV in reactors operated as RM or GS, with the T(90) and T(99) difference of 7C10 min and 14C20 min, respectively. The decay of both coronaviruses in sewer biofilm reactors can be simulated by biphasic first-order kinetic models, with the first-order rate constant 2C4 times higher during the first phase than the second phase. The decay of infectious HCoV and FIPV was significantly faster in the reactors with sewer biofilms than in the reactors without biofilms, suggesting an enhanced decay of these surrogate viruses due to the presence of biofilms and related processes. The mechanism of biofilms in virus adsorption and potential inactivation remains unclear and requires future investigations. The results indicate that the survivability of infectious coronaviruses detected using bulk wastewater overestimated the infectivity risk of coronavirus during wastewater transportations in sewers or the downstream treatment.","output":"Enhanced decay of coronaviruses in sewers with domestic wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: After publication of the 2019 ESC Guidelines for dyslipidemia, the LDL cholesterol target in patients with very high cardiovascular risk was reduced from 70 mg/dl to 55 mg/dl. Currently, there is more and more evidence that getting these levels is very important in prognosis, to avoid new cardiovascular events. The paradigm of this situation could be represented by young patients after STEMI, in which secondary prevention is essential to achieve a long-life expectancy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to analyze the impact the new guidelines have had on the control of LDL cholesterol in a population of young patients after STEMI, one year after their publication. METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive young patients (aged  40 years) presenting with STEMI admitted at our center between 2006 and 2017 were included. There were no exclusion criteria. We collect demographic, clinical and treatment information, and laboratory values in september/2019 and again one year later. RESULTS: Out of 101 patients, 89 were male (88.1%). Mean age was 35.87  4.07 years. Among the classic cardiovascular risk factors, dyslipidemia (44.5%) was the second one most prevalent in our cohort, after smoking (93.1%). In September/2019, only 66.3% of our patients had a recent LDL-cholesterol control, and only 20.9% of them had a target LDL-cholesterol lower than 55 mg/dl (\\"LDL-c -goal\\"). During the following year, a new determination of LDL cholesterol was only carried out in 18 patients out of the total sample, with these results: 15 patients had an LDL> 55 mg/dl; 2 patients maintained an \\"LDL-c-goal\\", and only a single patient achieved optimal control (from 81 mg/dl to 39 mg/dl) coinciding with the change from low to high intensity statin. Regarding lipid-lowering treatment, in September/2019 the 87.7% of our population were taking statins, 21.9% ezetimibe, and 0.0% PCSK9-inhibitors. In that moment, in 6 patients, the lipid-lowering treatment was reduced (all of them had LDL values were between 65-105 mg/dl). One year later, in September/2020, 82.2% were taking statins, 21.9% ezetimibe, and in 1 patient was started with the PCSK-9 inhibitor. Thirteen patients (12.9%) had suffered a reinfarction during follow-up, but none in the last year. CONCLUSIONS: Despite of the new LDL-cholesterol target established by the ESC Guidelines, we have not improved our lipid control in a population with high cardiovascular risk -with a percentage of cardiovascular events during mean follow-up that is not negligible-, being only 1 of each 5 patients correctly treated. We must carry out a closer clinical and analytical follow-up, by increasing our efforts in secondary prevention, and perhaps the Cardiac Rehabilitation Units can play an essential role in this objective. It is possible that the Covid-19 pandemic could have influenced these results.","output":"One year after the dyslipidemia esc guidelines: which impact in a high cardiovascular risk population is shown?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cerebrovascular autoregulation after resuscitation has not been well studied in an experimental model of pediatric cardiac arrest. Furthermore, developing noninvasive methods of monitoring autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) would be clinically useful in guiding neuroprotective hemodynamic management after pediatric cardiac arrest. We tested the hypotheses that the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) would shift to a higher arterial blood pressure between 1 and 2 days of recovery after cardiac arrest and that the LLA would be detected by NIRS-derived indices of autoregulation in a swine model of pediatric cardiac arrest. We also tested the hypothesis that autoregulation with hypertension would be impaired after cardiac arrest. METHODS Data on LLA were obtained from neonatal piglets that had undergone hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest and recovery for 1 day (n = 8) or 2 days (n = 8), or that had undergone sham surgery with 2 days of recovery (n = 8). Autoregulation with hypertension was examined in a separate cohort of piglets that underwent hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest (n = 5) or sham surgery (n = 5) with 2 days of recovery. After the recovery period, piglets were reanesthetized, and autoregulation was monitored by standard laser-Doppler flowmetry and autoregulation indices derived from NIRS (the cerebral oximetry [COx] and hemoglobin volume [HVx] indices). The LLA was determined by decreasing blood pressure through inflation of a balloon catheter in the inferior vena cava. Autoregulation during hypertension was evaluated by inflation of an aortic balloon catheter. RESULTS The LLAs were similar between sham-operated piglets and piglets that recovered for 1 or 2 days after arrest. The NIRS-derived indices accurately detected the LLA determined by laser-Doppler flowmetry. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve for cerebral oximetry index was 0.91 at 1 day and 0.92 at 2 days after arrest. The area under the curve for hemoglobin volume index was 0.92 and 0.89 at the respective time points. During induced hypertension, the static rate of autoregulation, defined as the percentage change in cerebrovascular resistance divided by the percentage change in cerebral perfusion pressure, was not different between postarrest and sham-operated piglets. At 2 days recovery from arrest, piglets exhibited neurobehavioral deficits and histologic neuronal injury. CONCLUSIONS In a swine model of pediatric hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest with confirmed brain damage, the LLA did not differ 1 and 2 days after resuscitation. The NIRS-derived indices accurately detected the LLA in comparison with laser-Doppler flow measurements at those time points. Autoregulation remained functional during hypertension.","output":"Noninvasive autoregulation monitoring in a swine model of pediatric cardiac arrest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To evaluate surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) in resident surgeons in their first year of performing cataract surgery, a retrospective study was conducted involving three resident physicians from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020.

This article describes a partnership between a 300-level \\"Drugs & Behavior\\" laboratory course and a local not-for-profit anti-drug coalition focused on drug education and prevention. A series of semester-long service-learning projects were developed that met instructional objectives and coalition goals. Briefly, students applied critical thinking and analytical skills to survey data on substance use, collected from local 6-12th grade students, that would inform coalition programming. By the end of the semester, students had produced scientific reports of the data, developed informational summaries for community distribution, and wrote a mock grant proposal incorporating proposed improvements to the study. During the semester, students reflected on the SL experience and took surveys on SL outcomes. Findings suggested that this SL opportunity helped students make connections between course content and the real world, enhanced skills or awareness in ways that added value to the course, challenged them to understand a problem and generate solutions, and expanded their thinking regarding their ability to help tackle substance use-related issues in the community.

This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human-codon-optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike.

Furthermore, trans-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity in human cells.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features and severe illness risk factors of the patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), in order to provide support for the progression prediction, clinical treatment and prognosis of NCP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 196 NCP patients treated in our hospital from January 25, 2020 to June 21, 2020 were divided into the severe group and the mild group. The clinical features of the two groups were analyzed and compared. The risk factors were explored by using multivariate logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained. The correlations of the risk factors with the prognosis of NCP were investigated combined with the lung function test. RESULTS: The primary clinical symptoms of 196 cases of NCP included fever in 167 cases (85.2%) and cough in 121 cases (61.73%). The chest computed tomography (CT) scans of the 178 cases (90.81%) showed a typical ground-glass opacification. In 149 cases, the lymphocyte count was decreased, while the levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-dimer (D-D) increased. 44 cases (22.45%) were found to be severely ill.

Unlike other common viruses, CoVs have not been shown to cause a more severe disease in immunocompromised subjects. Along with direct viral pathogenicity, in some individuals, CoV infection triggers an uncontrolled aberrant inflammatory response, leading to lung tissue damage. In patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), COVID-19 may therefore represent a serious threat. After a thorough review of the literature on CoV pathogenesis and cancer, we selected several shared features to define which patients can be considered at higher risk of COVID-19.

Imaging plays a key role in detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of pneumonitis in cancer patients. This lecture will discuss 1) diagnosis and monitoring of pneumonitis using CT patterns on imaging, 2) spectrum of CT patterns of pneumonitis focusing on immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, and 3) emerging challenges and pitfalls in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. When approaching pneumonitis on imaging, it is very important to note that pneumonitis represents lungs response to injury. The lungs response patterns to injury has several histologic manifestations with corresponding CT patterns, which are originally described in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and are also noted in the setting of pneumonitis secondary to cancer therapy. The assessment of extent and distribution of the lung abnormalities on CT is very important to recognize the distinct CT patterns. The spectrum of CT patterns is noted in pneumonitis from cancer therapies, and are associated with clinical severity of pneumonitis. Recognition of CT patterns helps to diagnosis, monitor, and prognosticate pneumonitis in cancer patients. In terms of pneumonitis from individual agents, the lecture will focus on pneumonitis from ICI and EGFR inhibitors, which are two representative agents used in lung cancer that can cause pneumonitis. ICI pneumonitis is relatively rare, but clinically serious and potentially life-threatening toxicity from ICI therapy, and is a leading cause of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-related deaths. The incidence of ICI pneumonitis is higher in lung cancer than in other cancers, indicating that pneumonitis is a particularly important issue in patients with lung cancer. The representative CT patterns of ICI pneumonitis include AIP/ARDS pattern, COP pattern, NSIP pattern, and HP pattern. Among these patterns, COP pattern is most common, noted in about two thirds of the patients. AIP/ARDS patten has the most severe clinical presentation and requires immediate clinical attention. The details of each of these CT patterns will be described with case presentations to demonstrate the characteristic features with clinical correlation. Pneumonitis is also a recognized class-effect for EGFR inhibitors. A higher incidence rate in Japanese population is noted, with a high mortality rate in the cohort studies from Japan, which is confirmed by the recent meta-analysis of 153 EGFR inhibitor trials in non-small cell lung cancer. The spectrum of CT patterns is also noted in EGFR inhibitor pneumonitis, and correlates with clinical severity and outcome. As the emerging issues with the advances of cancer therapies and the recent COVID pandemic, pneumonitis from combination ICI and radiotherapy is discussed, featuring the imaging manifestations from both ICI pneumonitis and radiation pneumonitis. Finally, the overlapping imaging features of ICI pneumonitis and COVID-19 pneumonia are presented, to demonstrate a unique challenge in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. The lecture concludes emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary approach to further understand these emerging challenges to optimize diagnosis and management of pneumonitis in cancer patients.

India's nationwide lockdown in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic therefore prompted concerns about disruption to this essential supply. A preliminary assessment of ARV drug manufacturers in India in March 2020 indicated a range of concerns. This prompted a rapid questionnaire-based survey in May 2020 of eight manufacturers that account for most of India's ARV drug exports. The greatest challenges reported were in international shipping, including delays, increased lead times and rising costs. Contrary to expectations, lack of access to the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) required for ARV drug manufacture was not a major hindrance, as manufacturers reported that their reliance on China for API supplies had reduced in recent years. However, their reliance on overseas markets for the raw materials required for local API synthesis was a major challenge. The findings from this survey have implications for addressing some of the immediate and medium-term concerns about the production and supply of generic ARV drugs. Long-term orders to support multi-month dispensing and buffer stocks need to be in place, together with computerized inventory management systems with real-time information from the lowest-level dispensation unit.

Clinicians are working to novel clinical guidelines, treating new patient cohorts and working in unfamiliar environments. Trauma and orthopaedics (T&O) has experienced cancellation of routine clinics and operating, with redistribution of the workload and human resources. To date, no studies have evaluated the mental health impact of these changes on the T&O workforce. We report the results of a novel survey on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of our orthopaedic workforce and the contributory factors. METHODS: A 20-question survey-based cross-sectional study of orthopaedic team members was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to identify the impact of the pandemic on mental health in the form of major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD). The survey incorporated the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2), which is validated for screening of MDD, and the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-2), which is validated for screening of GAD. RESULTS: There were 62 respondents (18 females and 44 males). As compared to the general population, we noted a greater estimated prevalence of GAD (17.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.0009297) and MDD (19.4% vs 3.3%, p = 0.0000007731). The prevalence of MDD symptoms was greatest among senior house officers (SHOs) (p = 0.02216). Female respondents scored higher for symptoms of MDD (p = 0.03583) and GAD (p = 0.0001086). Those identifying as Black, African, Caribbean or Black British displayed a higher prevalence of GAD symptoms (p = 0.001575) and felt least supported at work (p = 0.001341). CONCLUSION: Our study, in the first of its kind, shows a significant prevalence of GAD and MDD in the workforce. We found that SHOs, females and those of Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British origin were disproportionately affected.

The BALB/cV subline was used to study the molecular basis of potential virus-host interactions involving cell surface-expressed MMTV proteins. Cell surface iodination identified virus-specific proteins expressed on BALB/cv primary mammary tumor cells grown in culture. In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein. The 68K env protein was also detected on the surface of metabolically labeled BALB/cV tumor cells by an external immunoprecipitation technique. The expression of 68K env was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins. Biochemical analysis established that 68K env was not modified by N-linked glycosylation. 125I-labeled 68K env was rapidly released into the media of tumor cell cultures and was recovered both in the form of a soluble protein and in a 100,000 g pellet.

Widely regarded as Halo effect, this phenomenon has been studied for more than 100 years now, and findings such as the relationship between aesthetic perception and other personality traitssuch as competence and trustworthinesshave since been uncovered. Trustworthiness plays an especially crucial role in individuals' social interactions. Despite the large body of literature published on the Halo effect, and especially on the relationship between aesthetic appearance and perceived trustworthiness, little is known about the overall generalizability of the effect, as almost all of the studies have been conducted on adult participants from Western countries. Moreover, little is known about the stability of the effect over time, in the event of major destabilization, such as the outbreak of a pandemic. In this work, the cross-cultural generalizability of the Halo effect is investigated before and during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis of the generalizability and stability over time of the Halo effect is presented. Participants (N = 380, N = 145 Asians, N = 235 Caucasians) have been asked to rate the aesthetic appearance and perceived trustworthiness of a set of human faces of different ages, gender, and ethnicity. Result of our analysis demonstrated that the Halo effect (Aesthetic  trustworthiness) is influenced by the age of presented faces, but not by their gender or ethnicity. Moreover, our results show that the strength of the effect can be affected by external events and that the volatility is higher for adults' than children's faces.","output":"An Analysis of the Generalizability and Stability of the Halo Effect During the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Benzodiazepines have proven to be highly effective for treating insomnia and anxiety. Although considered safe when taken for a short period of time, a major riskCbenefit dilemma arises in the context of long-term use, relating to addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and potential side effects. For these reasons, benzodiazepines are not recommended for treating chronic sleep disorders, anxiety disorders, nor for people over the age of 65, and withdrawal among long-term users is a public health issue. Indeed, only 5% of patients manage to discontinue using these drugs on their own. Even with the help of a general practitioner, this rate does not exceed 25 to 30% of patients, of which approximately 7% manage to remain drug-free in the long term. Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) offer a crucial solution to this problem, having been shown to increase abstinence success to 70C80%. This article examines traditional and novel CBT techniques in this regard, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which address both the underlying condition (insomnia/anxiety) and the substance-related disorder. The theoretical framework and evidence supporting the use of these approaches are reviewed.

Using SSRIs can cause changes in serotonin metabolism. Serotonin provides platelet aggregation and plays a role in the regulation of vascular tone and coagulation processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of SSRI use on coagulation functions with thromboelastogram (TEG) in patients undergoing surgical operation and to compare with non-user cases. METHODS: The study was designed for 60 patients whose physical status was classified according to the American Society of Anes-thesiology (ASA) classification as ASA I-II were included in the study. During routine pre-operative blood tests, 2 ml complete blood sample used and TEG performed. The cases were divided into two groups as SSRI user and non-user and analyzed. RESULTS: R value was higher in SSRI user patients than in non-user patients. The MA value was significantly lower in SSRI user. There was no statistically significant difference in other parameters. In the evaluation based on duration of SSRI use, there was no statistically significant difference between those whose duration of use was more than 1 year and <1 year. CONCLUSION: When the coagulation process was evaluated by TEG method, it was seen that the onset of clotting was prolonged and thrombus formation was slowed down in SSRI users. The results did not reveal that SSRI alone was the cause of bleeding, but it was concluded that slowing the process might be important, especially for surgical operations.","output":"Comparison of pre-operative platelet functions by thromboelastogram in patients selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors user and non-user"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chikungunya virus infection is an infection transmitted by mosquitoes.

METHODS: Interviews with 111 participants (administrators n = 80; primary care providers n = 17; patient family advisors = 14) from 11 OHTs were conducted following a semi-structured guide. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Participants felt that primary care engagement was an ongoing, continuous cycle. Four themes were identified: 1) A low rules environment: limited direction from the Ministry (system-level), 2) Theyre at different starting points: impact of local context (initiative-level); 3) We want primary care to be actively involved: engagement efforts made by OHTs (initiative-level); 4) Waiting to hear a little bit more: primary care concerns about the OHT approach (sector-level). Thirteen factors impacting primary care engagement were identified across the four themes.

So far, the main objective of nanoMOFs as oral DDSs was to increase the bioavailability of the cargo, without considering the MOF intestinal crossing with potential advantages (e.g., increasing drug availability, direct transport to systemic circulation). Thus, we propose to address the direct quantification and visualization of MOFs intestinal bypass. For that purpose, we select the microporous Fe-based nanoMOF, MIL-127, exhibiting interesting properties as a nanocarrier (great biocompatibility, large porosity accessible to different drugs, green and multigram scale synthesis, outstanding stability along the gastrointestinal tract). Additionally, the outer surface of MIL-127 was engineered with the biopolymer chitosan (CS@MIL-127) to improve the nanoMOF intestinal permeation. The biocompatibility and intestinal crossing of nanoMOFs is confirmed using a simple and relevant in vivo model, Caenorhabditis elegans; these worms are able to ingest enormous amounts of nanoMOFs (up to 35 g per kg of body weight). Finally, an ex vivo intestinal model (rat) is used to further support the nanoMOFs bypass across the intestinal barrier, demonstrating a fast crossing (only 2 h). To the best of our knowledge, this report on the intestinal crossing of intact nanoMOFs sheds light on the safe and efficient application of MOFs as oral DDSs.","output":"Pushing the Limits on the Intestinal Crossing of MetalCOrganic Frameworks: An Ex Vivo and In Vivo Detailed Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a worldwide disease.

New research throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has shown an increased inflammatory and coagulopathic complication of COVID-19. We present a case of a patient with nonuremic calciphylaxis following treatment for severe COVID-19 and no known cause of hypercoagulability. A 40-year-old Caucasian female with a history of recent COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization, hypertension, alcohol abuse, anxiety, and one prior spontaneous miscarriage presented to the hospital with bilateral lower extremity wounds. The wounds were seen to have necrosis and eschar formation, as well as blackened mottled skin, and were extremely painful to the patient. The initial lesions were on the anterior thighs bilaterally and spread laterally and to the lower back. Initial autoimmune workup was non-specific, and biopsy confirmed calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a known dermatologic disease that has high mortality and morbidity, but it is usually associated with ESRD. Some cases have been reported for autoimmune or hypercoagulable states. The disease presents with non-healing, painful skin ulcers that are at a high risk of infection and have poor healing.

RESULTS: From 4455 initial studies, 45 articles met our criteria and were selected for further evaluation. Included publications reported an overall number of 53 COVID\\\\19\\\\related encephalitis cases. MRI showed hyperintensity of brain regions including white matter (44.68%), temporal lobe (17.02%), and thalamus (12.76%).

As a useful marker of healthcare system functionality, trends in maternal mortality provide a lens to gauge impact and inform mitigation strategies. OBJECTIVE: To report the findings of a rapid systematic review of studies on levels of maternal mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We systematically searched for studies on the 1st March 2021 in MEDLINE and Embase, with additional studies identified through MedRxiv and searches of key websites. We included studies that reported levels of mortality in pregnant and postpartum women in time-periods pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The maternal mortality ratio was calculated for each study as well as the excess mortality. RESULTS: The search yielded 3411 references, of which five studies were included in the review alongside two studies identified from grey literature searches. Five studies used data from national health information systems or death registries (Mexico, Peru, Uganda, South Africa, and Kenya), and two studies from India were record reviews from health facilities. There were increased levels of maternal mortality documented in all studies; however, there was only statistical evidence for a difference in maternal mortality in the COVID-19 era for four of these. Excess maternal mortality ranged from 8.5% in Kenya to 61.5% in Uganda. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring maternal mortality in pandemics presents many challenges, but also essential opportunities to understand and ameliorate adverse impact both for women and their newborns. Our systematic review shows a dearth of studies giving reliable information on levels of maternal mortality, and we call for increased and more systematic reporting of this largely preventable outcome.

Since prevention and social isolation are known to be the only ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19, this has created challenges among the lower-middle income countries (LMIC) including Pakistan, as it battles between an under-resourced healthcare, an economic shutdown, and widespread myths and misconceptions. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and perceptions regarding COVID-19 as public understanding is vital to help facilitate the control of this outbreak. METHODS: A pre-validated online questionnaire was distributed among the general population of Pakistan from 1st to 12th June 2020. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS v25. Adequate knowledge was assigned as a score of > 4 (range: 0C8) and good perception as a score of > 3 (range: 0C5). Chi-square test was used to determine the significance of difference in knowledge and perception of COVID-19 with socio-demographic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was run to identify factors associated with adequate knowledge and perception. P < 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: A total of 1200 respondents participated in this study with a wide range of age groups and education. Majority of the respondents had adequate knowledge (93.3%) with a mean score of 6.59  1.35, and good perception (85.6%) with a mean score of 4.29  0.82.

In this study we explore what kind of pre-surgical information patients need and if the provision of a 360? video of a surgical procedure can be of added value to the information provided by the hospital. METHODS: An explorative qualitative study using semi-structured interviews on information needs was conducted among 17 inguinal hernia patients to gain more insight in the patients present surgical information needs. Patients either were planned to receive or already had received a surgical procedure. Questions were asked about the current information provision and, after being shown a 360? video of the surgery, whether this would be of added value. RESULTS: Of the total group of 17 patients (mean age 56, interquartile range 45C64) 16 were male and one was female. Most had no previous experience with virtual reality (14/17), already had undergone a surgical procedure (11/17). Patient information needs were all about seeing which can be viewed from three different perspectives [1] being seen as a unique person in the treatment process, [2] being seen as a partner, and [3] seeing is understanding. Patients wanted the contact with the doctor to be more personal, with the possibility to see the anesthetist in person, the surgeon to see their wound in the recovery phase, and to receive personal answers to questions about their specific situation. Patients found the 360-video not fearsome, and believed that visual content could be beneficial as it appeals more to their imagination than written or oral information and increases their understanding. It also provided them with a better understanding of their treatment options, their pre-, peri-, and post-surgical procedures and identification of the cause of post-operative side effects. CONCLUSION: To address patients information needs, complementary tools or services are needed that increase personal contact as well as tailor it to individual patients needs. Even though video-apps are a partial alternative, hospitals should still offer patients the possibility of having face-to-face meetings with physicians as this is highly valued by patients and leads to increased trust in physicians performance.","output":"Patients want to be seen: The top 3 information needs of patients with inguinal hernia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by the COVID virus led universities to a change in the way they teach classes, moving to a distance mode.

The independent associates of mortality were older age, male gender, obesity, insulin treatment, low lymphocyte count, and pulmonary involvement on admission. Older age, low lymphocyte values, and pulmonary involvement at baseline were independently associated with longer hospital stay and/or ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The current study from the Turkish national health care database showed that patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 are at increased risk of mortality, longer hospital stay, and ICU admission.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes in Turkey: A nationwide study (TurCoviDia)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have become known to present with different oral symptoms. However, xerostomia remains poorly recognized compared with taste dysfunction. For better understanding of COVID-19 symptomatology, xerostomia associated withCOVID-19 was characterized and its possible pathogenesis was speculated by a narrative literature review. Scientific articles were retrieved by searching PubMed, LitCovid, ProQuest, Google Scholar, medRxiv and bioRxiv from 1 April 2020 with a cutoff date of 30 September 2021. Results of the literature search indicated that xerostomia is one of prevalent and persistent oral symptoms associated with COVID-19. In contrast to taste dysfunction, the prevalence and persistence of xerostomia do not necessarily depend on ethnicity, age, gender and disease severity of patients. COVID-19 xerostomia is pathogenically related to viral cellular entry-relevant protein expression, renin-angiotensin system disturbance, salivary gland inflammation, zinc deficiency, cranial neuropathy, intercurrent taste dysfunction, comorbidities and medications. Despite a close association with COVID-19, xerostomia, dry mouth and hyposalivation tend to be overlooked unlike ageusia, dysgeusia and hypogeusia. Although mouth dryness per se is not life-threating, it has an impact on the oral health-related quality of life.

The effectiveness of the preventive measures is greatly influenced by the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards the disease. In this study, KAP values and some characteristic features of people recovered from COVID-19 were determined by conducting a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods:&nbsp;The questionnaire survey was conducted between 1 and 10 January 2021 on people who recovered from COVID-19 in a total of 150 different locations in Turkey. The questionnaire consisted of 46 questions: 14 for determining demographic and some characteristic features of the participants, and 32 for determining their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The data obtained were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: It was determined that 63% of the participants had at least one chronic illness, 3.9% suffered from the disease twice, and 45.2% changed their smoking habits. The average knowledge score of the participants about COVID-19 was calculated as 10.25 (SD = 2.37; range 0-15). The participants were found to have a high level of knowledge about the symptoms and prevention methods in general, and positive changes in post-illness attitudes and behaviors. However, there was a great instability regarding the drugs and vaccines used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusions: This was the first study carried out in Turkey to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and some characteristic features of people who recovered from COVID-19. It was suggested that health authorities in the country need to develop more effective strategies and policies to find out permanent solutions in order to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic by taking into account the concerns of the public, particularly with regards to the drugs used in the treatment and vaccination.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Some Characteristic Features of People Recovered from COVID-19 in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been recognized for centuries that pregnant women have unique susceptibilities to many infectious diseases that predispose them to untoward outcomes compared with the general adult population. It is thought a combination of adaptive alterations in immunity to allow for the fetal allograft combined with changes in anatomy and physiology accompanying pregnancy underlie these susceptibilities. Emerging infectious diseases are defined as those whose incidence in humans has increased in the past two decades or threaten to increase in the near future. The past decade alone has witnessed many such outbreaks, each with its own unique implications for pregnant women and their unborn fetuses as well as lessons for the health care community regarding response and mitigation. Examples of such outbreaks include, but are not limited to, severe acute respiratory syndrome, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, Ebola virus, and, most recently, the Zika virus. Although each emerging pathogen has unique features requiring specific considerations, there are many underlying principles that are shared in the recognition, communication, and mitigation of such infectious outbreaks. Some of these key principles include disease-specific delineation of transmission dynamics, understanding of pathogen-specific effects on both mothers and fetuses, and advance planning and contemporaneous management that prioritize communication among public health experts, clinicians, and patients. The productive and effective working collaboration among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine has been a key partnership in the successful communication and management of such outbreaks for women's health care providers and patients alike. Going forward, the knowledge gained over the past decade will undoubtedly continue to inform future responses and will serve to optimize the education and care given to pregnant women in the face of current and future emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Emerging Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The parts of the RNA genome of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) required for replication and packaging of the RNA were investigated using deletion mutagenesis of a defective RNA (D-RNA) CD-61 (6.1 kb) containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene.

To reduce the spread of the virus, governments have introduced crisis management interventions that include border closures, quarantines, strict social distancing, marshaling of essential workers and enforced homeworking. COVID-19 measures are necessary to save the lives of some of the most vulnerable people within society, and yet in parallel they create a range of negative everyday effects for already marginalized people. Likely unintended consequences of the management of the COVID-19 crisis include elevated risk for workers in low-paid, precarious, and care-based employment, over-representation of minority ethnic groups in case numbers and fatalities, and gendered barriers to work. Drawing upon feminist ethics of care, I theorize a radical alternative to the normative assumptions of rationalist crisis management. Rationalist approaches to crisis management are typified by utilitarian logics, masculine and militaristic language, and the belief that crises follow linear processes of signal detection, preparation/prevention, containment, recovery, and learning. By privileging the quantifiable - resources and measurable outcomes - such approaches tend to omit considerations of pre-existing structural disadvantage.

This study examined the one-year prevalence of suicidality including suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans (SP), and suicide attempts (SA) as well as their correlates in clinically stable MDD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between October 1, 2020, and October 15, 2021 in six tertiary psychiatric hospitals. Socio-demographic information, clinical data and one-year prevalence of suicidality were recorded. Results Altogether, 1718 participants who met the eligibility criteria were included. The overall one-year prevalence of suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic was 68.04% (95% confidence intervals (CI) =65.84C70.25%), with one-year SI prevalence of 66.4% (95%CI = 64.18%C68.65%), SP prevalence of 36.26% (95%CI = 33.99%C38.54%), and SA prevalence of 39.35% (95%CI = 37.04%C41.66%). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed male gender, married marital status, college education level and above and age were negatively associated with risk of suicidality. Urban residence, unemployed work status, experiences of cyberbullying, a history of suicide among family members or friends, and more severe fatigue, physical pain, and residual depressive symptoms were positively associated with risk of suicidality. Conclusions Suicidality is common among clinically stable MDD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This study employed 276 healthy children, aged 10C12 years, and their parents. Data were collected in October and November 2020, about 9 months after the local closing of schools due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Parents and children answered a separate set of questions. Besides the demographic information, the parents responded to questions on their stress level, perceived risk of COVID-19, and PA avoidance for children. Children responded to questions on their PA and wellbeing in the last week. Data were analyzed using SmartPLS and IBM SPSS 22. RESULTS: The result of the study supported the four directional research hypotheses of the sequential study model. As hypothesized, parents stress and perceived risk levels of COVID-19 negatively affected childrens PA. The PA level was shown to predict childrens wellbeing and mental health. Housing type, parents job security, number of siblings, number of members living together in-home, and history of death or hospitalization of relatives or family members due to COVID-19 were found to be associated with parents stress and childrens mental health. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on parents role in childrens wellbeing and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To reduce the spread, it is important to engage in preventive behaviors recommended by health authorities, such as washing your hands, wearing a face mask, and social distancing. Aim: In the present study, we draw from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the associations between perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm and whether people engage in eight different preventive behaviors. Methods: For each of the preventive behaviors (washing hands; using hand sanitizer; not touching your face; social distancing; wearing a face mask; disinfecting surfaces; coughing in your elbow; staying home if sick), we conducted separate logistic regressions predicting whether the participants (N = 2,256; age range = 1898 years) reported engaging in the behavior from their perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm. Results: We found that perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm had independent significant associations with each preventive behavior. Moderation analyses revealed that for most behaviors the associations with perceived behavioral control were stronger for older adults than for younger adults. Limitation: The present study was cross-sectional; future longitudinal studies and interventions are needed to disentangle directionality.

MethodsWe reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). FindingsCOVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates.

Three or possibly four classes of recombinants were isolated. Recombinants in the first class, which are similar to the ones previously reported, contain a single crossover in either gene A or B, which are the 5-most genes. The second class of recombinants contain double crossovers in gene A. The third class of recombinants have crossovers within the leader sequence located at the 5-end of the genome. The crossover sites of the third class have been located between 35 and 60 nucleotides from the 5-end of the leader RNA. One of these recombinants has double crossovers within the short region comprising the leader sequences. Finally, we describe one recombinant which may contain a triple crossover. The presence of so many recombination sites within the 5-end of the genome of murine coronaviruses confirms that RNA recombination is a frequent event during MHV replication and is consistent with our proposed model of copy-choice recombination in which RNA replication occurs in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner.","output":"Multiple recombination sites at the 5-end of murine coronavirus RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Globally, COVID-19 is an emerging health problem.

There has been an immediate need for research to understand the clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that can help predict deterioration including mechanical ventilation, organ support, and death. Studies thus far have addressed the epidemiology of the disease, common presentations, and susceptibility to acquisition and transmission of the virus; however, an accurate prognostic model for severe manifestations of COVID-19 is still needed because of the limited healthcare resources available. Objective This systematic review aims to evaluate published reports of prediction models for severe illnesses caused COVID-19. Methods Searches were developed by the primary author and a medical librarian using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating terms. Comprehensive strategies, including both index and keyword methods, were devised for PubMed and EMBASE. The data of confirmed COVID-19 patients from randomized control studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies published between January 2020 and July 2020 were retrieved. Studies were independently assessed for risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We collected study type, setting, sample size, type of validation, and outcome including intubation, ventilation, any other type of organ support, or death. The combination of the prediction model, scoring system, performance of predictive models, and geographic locations were summarized. Results A primary review found 292 articles relevant based on title and abstract. After further review, 246 were excluded based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty-six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Inter observer agreement on inclusion was 0.86 (95% confidence interval: 0.79 - 0.93). When the PROBAST tool was applied, 44 of the 46 articles were identified to have high or unclear risk of bias, or high or unclear concern for applicability. Two studied reported prediction models, 4C Mortality Score from hospital data and QCOVID from general public data from UK, and were rated as low risk of bias and low concerns for applicability. Conclusion Several prognostic models are reported in the literature, but many of them had concerning risks of biases and applicability. For most of the studies, caution is needed before use, as many of them will require external validation before dissemination.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, our previously-applied face-to-face format was replaced with a video-based format. We herein quantify the usefulness of daily video-based peer review within a busy radiation oncology practice. Materials/Methods We have been using an internet-based format for our daily peer review since mid-March 2020. All cases in the department are reviewed prior to planning and a subset, typically stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) cases, are reviewed twice: once for contours and once for the planned dose. A meeting participant collected data regarding attendance, case type, and recommendations made in the meetings. An anonymous survey was sent to all participants to assess their opinion of this daily meeting. The number and type of recommendations resulting from the video-based peer review were compared to the results of a similar review conducted in the pre-COVID (face-to-face) era using a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Results From September 11, 2020 C December 23, 2020, data was gathered from 62 peer-review sessions. The mean number of attendees each day was 43 (range 32-60), including 9 MD faculty (range 4-12) and 7 MD residents (range 5-8). The average number of cases reviewed each day was 9 (range 3-17). In total, 533 cases were reviewed; 74% had no recommendations, 8% had mild, 15% had moderate, and 3% had major recommendations leading to significant changes in treatment planning. Among cases reviewed during the pre-COVID era 73% had none, 10% had mild, 10% had moderate, and 7% had major recommendations. The rate of major recommendations during the current video-format era is significantly decreased from before (3% vs 7%, P < 0.001). Twenty-nine participants responded to the survey. For the video-based peer review session, 97% reported that it adds value to the department, 83% reported that it provides an excellent learning environment, and 93% reported that it allows for a collegial debate/conversation. Conclusion Video-based peer review can be effective; 18% of case reviews resulted in moderate/major recommendations. While comparisons across time are imperfect, this is almost identical to the 17% observed in the pre-COVID (face-to-face) era, which is reassuring. However, the rate of major recommendations from the current video-format era were lower than in the pre-COVID (face-to-face) era, suggesting that the robustness of daily peer review may be reduced with video. Nevertheless, the majority of participants responding to the survey (83-97%) still find the overall process useful.","output":"The Utility of Video-Based Pre-Treatment Peer Review in the COVID Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused impressive damages and disruptions in social, economic, and health systems (among others), and posed unprecedented challenges to public health and policy/decision-makers concerning the design and implementation of measures to mitigate its strong negative impacts. The Portuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like techniques to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for each county, region, or the whole country. Such decision tools led to some criticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches, in particular those having in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising, e.g., from new virus variants or vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by researchers of the Covid-19 Committee of Instituto Superior T\\\\'ecnico at Universidade de Lisboa (CCIST analysts team) and medical doctors from the Crisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM experts team) gathered efforts and worked together in order to propose a new tool to help politicians and decision-makers in the combat of the pandemic. This paper presents the main steps and elements, which led to the construction of a pandemic impact assessment composite indicator, applied to the particular case of {\\\\sc{Covid-19}} in Portugal. A multiple criteria approach based on an additive multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) aggregation model was used to construct the pandemic assessment composite indicator (PACI). The parameters of the additive model were built through a sociotechnical co-constructive interactive process between CCIST and GCOM team members. The deck of cards method was the technical tool adopted to help in building the value functions and the assessment of the criteria weights.","output":"A multiple criteria approach for constructing a pandemic impact assessment composite indicator: The case of Covid-19 in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To assess student perceptions of remote learning curricula implemented by clinical clerkships at a single US medical school during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Students enrolled in core clinical clerkships at the UC San Diego School of Medicine from March to April 2020 were sent an anonymous online survey, assessing components of remote learning curricula via quantitative rating and free-response questions. Results: Of 132 students enrolled, 96 (73%) completed the survey. Online question banks, remote progress reviews, and telehealth sessions were rated as the most valuable resources, while textbooks were rated least valuable. Most students felt that the number of resources was adequate (69/94, 74%), the quantity of required content was appropriate (77/93, 83%), and there was a good balance of rigidity versus flexibility in the schedule (81/94, 86%). Most students felt \\"prepared\\" or \\"somewhat prepared\\" for the shelf examination (61/91, 67%) and for the next year of medical training (73/94, 78%). In narrative reflections, students valued the flexibility afforded by remote curricula but desired some weekly structure. Students enjoyed expanded access to learning resources and participating in interactive remote sessions. Students expressed anxiety about the pandemic and uncertainty regarding medical education, but transparent communication from clerkship directors helped assuage these concerns. Conclusions: Student participation in direct patient care is fundamental to medical school core clerkships and was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

This limits the autonomy of older people and may have unintended adverse consequences. AIMS: To ascertain the self-reported physical and psychological effects of cocooning and the expressed priorities of older adults themselves during the pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, survey-based study involving 93 patients aged 65 and older, attending geriatric medicine out-patient and ambulatory day hospital services or our in-patient rehabilitation units. Demographic data was obtained from the medical records. Frailty level was calculated using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and disease burden was calculated with the Charlson Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Mean age was 79.1 (range 66C96), 24% had dementia, and most were mildly frail (CFS < 5). One-third reported new feelings of depression, decreased mobility, and loss of enjoyment as a consequence cocooning. Loneliness was more prevalent amongst in-patients (38% vs 9%, p > 0.001). Respondents worried more about the risks of COVID-19 to their family than themselves. Expressed priorities varied from enjoying life as much as possible to protecting the development of children.

Therefore, how to design 3D printed objects with less materials while maintain structural soundness is an important problem. The current treatment is to use thin shells. However, thin shells have low strength. In this paper, we use stiffeners to stiffen 3D thin-shell objects for increasing the strength of the objects and propose a stress guided optimization framework to achieve minimum material consumption. First, we carry out finite element calculations to determine stress distribution in 3D objects and use the stress distribution to guide random generation of some points called seeds. Then we map the 3D objects and seeds to a 2D space and create a Voronoi Diagram from the seeds. The stiffeners are taken to be the edges of the Voronoi Diagram whose intersections with the edges of each of the triangles used to represent the polygon models of the 3D objects are used to define stiffeners. The obtained intersections are mapped back to 3D polygon models and the cross-section size of stiffeners is minimized under the constraint of the required strength. Monte-Carlo simulation is finally introduced to repeat the process from random seed generation to cross-section size optimization of stiffeners. Many experiments are presented to demonstrate the proposed framework and its advantages.","output":"Minimizing Material Consumption of 3D Printing with Stress-Guided Optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has put pressure on health-care services forcing the reorganisation of traditional care pathways. We investigated how physicians taking care of severe asthma patients in Europe reorganised care, and how these changes affected patient satisfaction, asthma control and future care. Methods In this European-wide cross-sectional study, patient surveys were sent to patients with a physician-diagnosis of severe asthma, and physician surveys to severe asthma specialists between November 2020 and May 2021. Results 1101 patients and 268 physicians from 16 European countries contributed to the study. Common physician-reported changes in severe asthma care included use of video/phone consultations (46%), reduced availability of physicians (43%) and change to home-administered biologics (38%). Change to phone/video consultations was reported in 45% of patients, of whom 79% were satisfied or very satisfied with this change. Of 709 patients on biologics, 24% experienced changes in biologic care, of whom 92% were changed to home-administered biologics and of these 62% were satisfied or very satisfied with this change. Only 2% reported worsening asthma symptoms associated with changes in biologic care. Many physicians expect continued implementation of video/phone consultations (41%) and home administration of biologics (52%). Conclusions Change to video/phone consultations and home administration of biologics was common in severe asthma care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was associated with high satisfaction levels in most but not all cases.

We have created a taxonomy of possible categories of disease dynamics, and used the evolution of reported COVID-19 cases relative to changes in disease control measures, together with total reported cases and deaths, to allocate most countries and territories among the possible categories. As of 31 January 2021, we find that the disease was (1) kept out or suppressed quickly through quarantines and testing & tracing in 39 countries with 29 million people, (2) suppressed on one or more occasions through control measures in 74 countries with 2.49 billion people, (3) spread slowly but not suppressed, with cases still increasing or just past a peak, in 31 countries with 1.45 billion people, (4) spread through the population, but slowed a result of control measures, leading to a \\"flattened curve\\" and fewer infections than if the epidemic were unmitigated, in 32 countries with 2.24 billion people, and (5) spread through the population with some but limited mitigation in 5 countries with 168 million people. In addition, several countries have experienced increases in cases after disease appeared to have finished spreading due to declining numbers of susceptible people. For some of these countries - for example Kenya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - the resurgences can be explained by the relaxation of control measures (and may have been enhanced by disease spread in population segments that experienced lower infection levels during the first waves). For other countries, the resurgences point to the effects of new virus variants with higher-transmissibility or immunity resistance - including most countries in Southern Africa (where the B.1.351 variant has been identified) and several countries in West Africa (maybe due to the B.1.351 or a different variant). These findings are consistent with mounting evidence of high infection rates in several low- and middle-income countries, both from seroprevalence studies and estimates of actual deaths from COVID-19 combined with estimates of expected mortality rates. We estimate that 1.3-3.0 billion people, or 17-39% of the global population, have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 to date, and that at least 5 million people have died from COVID-19 - much higher than reported cases and deaths.

We determined that there is limited flexibility with regard to the utilization of PPE between ideal and low-resource settings. Some compromises are possible, especially with regard to PPE use, during endoscopic procedures. We have, therefore, also stressed the need to prevent transmission of COVID-19 by measures other than PPE and to conserve PPE by reduction of patient volume, limiting procedures to urgent or emergent, and reducing the number of staff and trainees involved in procedures.

However, studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may play a significant role as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of TCM as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 through a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Four English and three Chinese language databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. RCTs comparing TCM in combination with Western medicine (WM) with the same WM therapies alone for confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The outcome measures were cure rate, lowering of body temperature, cough relief, improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) images, deterioration of condition, and adverse effects. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A series of meta-analyses were conducted for selected outcomes using RevMan 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was appraised using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1,285 patients were included. Compared with WM alone in treating COVID-19, WM with auxiliary treatment by TCM appears to have increased the cure rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.26]), relieved cough (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.15-1.52]), improved chest CT images (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.11-1.37]), and reduced the number of cases transitioning from a moderate to severe condition (RR 0.58 [95% CI 0.43-0.77]). The authors are uncertain whether TCM combined WM has effects on fever normalization (RR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.29]) or adverse effects (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.57]). Although they evaluated the certainty of evidence for lowering body temperature and adverse effects as very low, and low for cure rate, certainty was evaluated as moderate for improvement in chest CT images, cough relief, and deterioration of condition. Conclusion: TCM may be an effective auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is likely to help improve the main symptoms and reduce disease progression. However, due to the limited number of studies and apparent heterogeneity among them, a more definitive conclusion on the effect of TCM on lowering body temperature and adverse effects cannot be drawn at this time.","output":"The Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine as an Auxiliary Treatment for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the unprecedented pressures on healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical students internationally volunteered to assist in hospitals.

Set aside from social distancing and self-isolating, the British Society for Rheumatology proposed pragmatic guidance for different groups of patients for shielding. Clinical presentation, epidemiology, and potential treatment opinions of the management of COVID-19 patients with rheumatic disease had been reported, but a few reports which show a comparison between survivors and non-survivors in relation to their co-morbidities. Methods We collected data from a search identifying 1,200 patients testing positive for SARS-COV-2 with an identified rheumatological condition until 31st April 2020 at Imperial College NHS Trust. A positive laboratory finding is defined as one or more positive result for SARS-COV-2 PCR on nasopharyngeal swab done for inpatients. Results Among 1,200 patients, 39 patients had underlying rheumatological diseases.12 patients died, and 27 patients were discharged. 50% of the patients who died had chronic kidney disease as an existing comorbidity (OR 26, 95%CI ( 2.6-258.1), p value 0.001) compared with only 3% of patients who survived. All the patients with heart failure in this sample died in hospital (33%, OR 29, 95%CI (1.4-597.4, p value 0.006). Regarding drug therapy, 50% of patients who died were receiving more than one immunosuppressant compared with 37% of those who survived. There was a significant association linking non-survivors with a high CRP value (54% , OR 25.2, 95% CI ( 2.44-258.2), p value 0.009) compared with only 4.5% in patients who survived. 70% of patients who died had d-dimer of (>2000ng/ml) compared with 16% of those who survived (OR 11.6, 95% CI ( 1.86-73.06), p value 0.011). Creatinine level also had a significant link with non-survival. 58% patients who died had an initial creatinine (>140umol/l) compared with 18% of survivors (p value 0.0232). Additionally the patients with an elevated creatinine prior to deterioration (which is an indication of acute kidney injury) represented 32% of the total sample and of those, 66% did not survive compared with 13% who did (p value 0.007).We also reviewed the medication adjustment according to NICE guideline. In our study, it was observed that medications were properly adjusted after discussion with rheumatologist.

METHODS This retrospective study included adults with ARDS treated with iEPO. The primary endpoint was the variables associated with a positive response to iEPO. Secondary endpoints were positive response rate and the change in PF and SpO2:FiO2 within 6 hours. Statistical analysis included multivariable regression. RESULTS Three hundred thirty-one patients were included. As baseline PF increased, the odds of responding to iEPO decreased (odds ratio [OR], 0.752, 95% CI, 0.69-0.819, p < 0.001).

With increased capacity in production, VET has become one of the main suppliers of society in these days. In this study, developments in production via VET within the scope of coronavirus measures are briefly reviewed. Additionally, improvement areas and steps that need to be taken to strengthen VET are discussed. In these pandemic days, cleaning materials, medical masks, and disposable materials are essential products, which are hard to procure. With the support of Ministry of National Education, 10 million masks are produced in VET high schools monthly. Cleaning material needs of all schools around Turkey can be met with the productions of VET high schools. Face protection shields, disposable materials, and face masks with N95 standard are produced via R&D studies in VET and they are shared with healthcare professionals. This study shows that VET in Turkey can respond to the needs of society quickly in pandemic days with developments in VET in the past two years following the announcement of 2023 Educational Vision. A strengthened VET system with mentioned points in the study can play a major role in meeting the needs of the society during possible crisis periods.Alternate abstract:Mesleki ve teknik e?itimin (MTE) ?nemi Trkiye'de koronavirs salg?n? srecinde daha da ?ne kmt?r.

Whereas, the WHO/UNICEF integrated community case management (iCCM) protocol recommends referral by community level health workers (CLHWs) to a health facility. This study aims to evaluate whether CLHWs can treat chest indrawing pneumonia effectively and safely. Methods: This multi-centre cluster randomized controlled open label, non-inferiority trial will be conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Malawi. All sites will use a common protocol with the same study design, participants, intervention, control and outcomes. CLHWs will identify 2-59 months old children with chest indrawing. Study supervisors, trained in the iCCM protocol, will confirm CLHWs' findings. Pulse oximetry will be used to identify hypoxaemic children. In the intervention group, enrolled children will be treated with oral amoxicillin for 5 days, and in the control group they will be referred to a health facility, after providing first dose of oral amoxicillin. An independent outcome assessor will visit each enrolled child on days 6 and 14 of enrolment, to assess study outcomes. Conclusions: If CLHWs can effectively and safely treat chest indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 months old children, it will increase access to pneumonia treatment substantially, as in many settings, health facilities and trained health workers are not easily accessible. Moreover, this evidence will contribute towards the review of the current iCCM protocol and its harmonization with the IMCI protocol.

D614G was reported to confer high infectivity and became the dominant form of the virus globally. Interestingly, current evidence found that D614G protein increases its infectivity dependent on the ACE2 receptor, and its co-binding receptor, DPP4.

The present study aimed to assess the underlying mechanisms of malarial exposure risk at a fine scale in 5-km(2) sites across the Brazilian Amazon, using field-collected data with a longitudinal spatiotemporally structured approach. Anopheline mosquitoes were sampled from 80 sites to investigate the Plasmodium infection rate in mosquito communities and to estimate the malaria exposure risk in rural landscapes. The remaining amount of forest cover (accumulated deforestation) and the deforestation timeline were estimated in each site to represent the main parameters of both the frontier malaria hypothesis and an alternate scenario, the deforestation-malaria hypothesis, proposed herein. The maximum frequency of pathogenic sites occurred at the intermediate forest cover level (50% of accumulated deforestation) at two temporal deforestation peaks, e.g., 10 and 35 years after the beginning of the organization of a settlement. The incidence density of infected anophelines in sites where the original forest cover decreased by more than 50% in the first 25 years of settlement development was at least twice as high as the incidence density calculated for the other sites studied (adjusted incidence density ratio = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38C3.68; p = 0.001).

Previous studies show a pivotal role of oxidative stress in PINP. Because the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been considered as the critical regulator of endogenous antioxidant defense, we here explored whether activation of Nrf2 could attenuate PINP. A rat model of PINP was established by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (2 mg/kg) every other day with a final cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg. Hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) in response to von Frey filament stimuli were used to assess mechanical allodynia. We showed that a single dose of Nrf2 activator, oltipraz (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg), dose-dependently attenuated established mechanical allodynia, whereas repeated injection of oltipraz (100 mg kg(?1) d(?1), i.p. from d 14 to d 18) almost abolished the mechanical allodynia in PINP rats. The antinociceptive effect of oltipraz was blocked by pre-injection of Nrf2 inhibitor trigonelline (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Early treatment with oltipraz (100 mg kg(?1) d(?1), i.p. from d 0 to d 6) failed to prevent the development of the PINP, but delayed its onset. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly upregulated in the spinal cord of PINP rats. Repeated injection of oltipraz caused further elevation of the expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the spinal cord of PINP rats, which was reversed by pre-injection of trigonelline.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the 3D laparoscopy is beneficial in transabdominal preperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (TAPP). METHOD In this prospective, single-blinded, single-center, superior randomized trial, patients scheduled for TAPP were randomly allocated to either 3D or two-dimensional (2D) TAPP laparoscopic approaches. Patients were excluded if secondary operation was planned, the risk of conversion was high, or the surgeon had less than five previous 3D laparoscopic procedures. Patients were operated on by 13 residents and 3 attendings. The primary endpoint was operation time. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02367573). RESULTS Total 278 patients were randomized between 5th February 2015 and 23rd October 2017. Median operation time was shorter in the 3D group (56.0 min vs. 68.0 min, p < 0.001). 10 (8%) patients in 3D group and 6 (5%) patients in 2D group had clinically significant complications (Clavien-Dindo 2 or higher) (p = 0.440). Rate of hernia recurrence was similar between groups at 1-year follow-up.

Relatedly, many states have responded to COVID-19 by relaxing their alcohol laws, making it possible for adults to have alcohol delivered to their homes. This study sought to understand the impact of allowing alcohol home delivery on self-reported adult alcohol consumption in the US. Methods: In May 2020, we surveyed a convenience sample of U.S. adults over 21 years of age recruited through social media and listservs. Eight hundred and thirty-two participants completed the online survey: 84% were female, 85% were White, and 72% were between the ages of 26 and 49. Results: Twenty-one percent of participants who consumed alcohol in the past month had at least some alcohol delivered, with 60% having it delivered from liquor stores, restaurants, or bars. The remainder of the participants purchased the alcohol in-person or owned it pre-COVID-19. Participants who reported having alcohol delivered also reported consuming more drinks (? = 13.3; 95% CI [8.2, 18.4]; p < .000) and drinking on more days (? = 5.0; 95% CI [2.9, 7.0]; p < .000) over the past month than participants who obtained alcohol through other methods.

PRRSV helicase nsp10 is an important component of the replication transcription complex that plays a crucial role in viral replication, making nsp10 an important target for drug development. Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length nsp10 from the arterivirus PRRSV, which has multiple domains: an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a 1B domain and helicase core domains (1A and 2A). Importantly, our structural analyses indicate that the conformation of the 1B domain from arterivirus nsp10 undergoes a dynamic transition. The polynucleotide substrate channel formed by domains 1A and 1B adopts an open state, which may create enough space to accommodate and bind dsRNA during unwinding. Moreover, we report a unique C-terminal domain structure that participates in stabilizing overall helicase structure. Our biochemical experiments also showed that deletion of the 1B domain and C-terminal domain significantly reduced the helicase activity of nsp10, indicating that the four domains must cooperate to contribute to helicase function. Besides, our results indicate that nidoviruses contain a conserved helicase core domain and key amino acid sites affecting helicase function, which share common mechanism of helicase translocation and unwinding activity. These findings will help to further our understanding of the mechanism of helicase function and provide new targets for the development of antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major respiratory disease agent in pigs that causes enormous economic losses to the global swine industry. PRRSV helicase nsp10 is a multifunctional protein with translocation and unwinding activities and plays a vital role in viral RNA synthesis.

Our results show that the 1B domain of PRRSV nsp10 adopts a novel open state and has a unique C-terminal domain structure, which plays a crucial role in nsp10 helicase activity. Furthermore, mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed conservation of the helicase catalytic domain across the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae).

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing all patients completing  1 Pl-OC cycle from 2016 to 2018 at a large single-center OC program. Subjects were categorized by age at retrieval and number of cycles. We extrapolated age-based oocyte thresholds for 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR from previously published data. We calculated the proportion of subjects overall, and for each age group, whose number of frozen oocytes was greater than or equal to their age-based threshold for a 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR after 1 and 2 cycles. OR for 60% eLBR with one cycle was calculated for age and AMH cutoff values and corroborated with logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 1241 subjects, completing 1799 Pl-OC cycles, were included. With one cycle, 66% (819/1241) achieved  50% eLBR and 51% (634/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. With two cycles, 79.6% (988/1241) attained  50% eLBR and 65.5% (813/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. Achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR with 1-2 cycles was significantly associated with both age (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.001).

We suggest that ecological economics aligns well with public health goals, including concern for equality and redistribution. Ecological economics offers an opportunity to make the transition to an economic system that is designed to promote human and planetary health from the outset, rather than one where social and environmental externalities must be constantly corrected after the fact. Important ideas from ecological economics include the use of a multidimensional framework to evaluate economic and social performance, the prioritisation of wellbeing and environmental goals in decision making, policy design and evaluation that take complex relationships into account, and the role of provisioning systems (the physical and social systems that link resource use and social outcomes). We discuss possible interventions at the national scale that could promote public health and that align with the prioritisation of social and ecological objectives, including universal basic income or services and sovereign money creation.

The aim of this study was to develop a novel HORC model that contains the retina, RPE-choroid and sclera to maintain retinal integrity when culturing retinal explants. After cutting circumferentially along the limbus to remove iris and lens, four deep incisions were made to flatten the eyecup. In contrast to previous HORC protocols, a trephine was used to cut through not only the retina but also the RPE-choroid and sclera. The resultant triple-layered explants were cultured for 72 h. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&E) was used to assess anatomical structures and retinal explants were further characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for apoptosis, Mller cell integrity and retinal inflammation. To confirm the possibility of disease induction, explants were exposed to high glucose (HG) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cyt), to mimic diabetic retinopathy (DR). The Luminex magnetic bead assay was used to measure DR-related cytokines released into the culture medium. H&E staining revealed distinct retinal lamellae and compact nuclei in retinal explants with the underlying RPE-choroid and sclera, while retinas without the underlying structures exhibited reduced thickness and severe nuclei loss. IHC results indicated absence of apoptosis and retinal inflammation as well as preserved Mller cell integrity. The Luminex assays showed significantly increased secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines in retinal explants exposed to HG + Cyt relative to baseline levels at 24 h. We successfully developed and characterized a novel HORC protocol in which retinal integrity was preserved without apoptosis or retinal inflammation. Moreover, the induced secretion of DR-associated pro-inflammatory biomarkers when exposing retinal explants to HG + Cyt suggests that this model could be used for clinically translatable retinal disease studies.","output":"Characterization of a Novel Human Organotypic Retinal Culture Technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020, more than any other previous year, posed serious questions about the nature of the Chinese state and society and their relations with the world.

Using the work WhatsApp chat, we aimed to facilitate better sharing of the one machine. Plan, do, study, act (PDSA) 1 intervention introduced the project protocol, which encouraged doctors to post a photo of the device after use, captioned with its location. PDSA 2 involved printing a physical copy of the memorandum and attaching it to the machine to prompt further compliance. In PDSA 3, concise photo-posting guidelines were established and adherence was encouraged to mitigate concerns for potential confidential-data leaks. A dynamic outcome measure, the overall effectiveness metric (OEM), was conceived to prospectively monitor the effectiveness of our interventions. An OEM 1 indicates engagement and thereby improvement, whereby <1 indicates no change compared with baseline. The intervention in PDSA 1 was a success with an OEM of 3.5. Although no actual data leaks occurred, a potential for concern was raised by a senior doctor. This limited engagement with the protocol during PDSA 2 and 3, causing the OEM to decline to <1 towards the end of the project. Sixty percent reported that the protocol saved them time in locating the machine.

The data provided in this article are anecdotal and based on participation in the workshops. Images created during the workshops are also shared as examples of the types of reflection that graphic medicine can enable. The workshops themselves were designed collaboratively and are based on the theoretical principles of graphic medicine, narrative medicine, and racial and social justice. They were conducted as part of a larger wellness initiative and were offered to health care-focused faculty at our academic medical institution. Our findings suggest that this was a beneficial activity which helped participants to reflect and reconsider their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic and surging awareness of racial injustice. Reflections also showed that drawings were correlated with ProQOL scores and may, in larger numbers, also help to mitigate or bring attention to issues of burnout in frontline providers. Drawings shared show the tremendous impact of COVID-19 and the simultaneous chaos and emptiness of practicing during dual pandemics. Our workshops engaged about 20 frontline health care providers and other health care faculty and highlight the utility of graphic medicine as a tool for building resilience and encouraging self-reflection.

Although a large number of computational models of the olfactory system have been proposed, they do not account for the diversity in physiology, connectivity of local neurons, and several recent discoveries in the insect antennal lobe, a major olfactory organ in insects. Recent studies revealed that the response of some projection neurons were reduced by application of a GABA antagonist, and that insects are sensitive to odor pulse frequency. To account for these observations, we propose a spiking neural circuit model of the insect antennal lobe. Based on recent anatomical and physiological studies, we included three sub-types of local neurons as well as synaptic short-term depression (STD) in the model and showed that the interaction between STD and local neurons resulted in frequency-sensitive responses. We further discovered that the unexpected response of the projection neurons to the GABA antagonist is the result of complex interactions between STD and presynaptic inhibition, which is required for enhancing sensitivity to odor stimuli. Finally, we found that odor discrimination is improved if the innervation of the local neurons in the glomeruli follows a specific pattern. Our findings suggest that STD, presynaptic inhibition and diverse physiology and connectivity of local neurons are not independent properties, but they interact to play key roles in the function of antennal lobes.","output":"Short term depression, presynaptic inhibition and local neuron diversity play key functional roles in the insect antennal lobe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has unprecedented consequences on population health, with governments worldwide issuing stringent public health directives. In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on peoples mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure the primary outcomes of adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Life Sciences and Medicine College Ethics Review Board (CERB) at the University of Aberdeen (CERB/2020/5/1942). Results will be made available to policy makers, funders, interested lay people and other researchers through weekly reports and three bimonthly bulletins placed on the CHARIS website and advertised through social media.","output":"Protocol of the COVID-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) study: understanding changes in adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours, mental and general health, in repeated cross-sectional representative survey of the Scottish population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating clinical manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia and is mainly based on an immune-driven pathology.

Moreover, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 differ from TLR4 in two particularly important ways for antiviral immunity: they can be activated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking compounds produced during the viral cycle, and they are typically present within the cell, along the endocytic pathway, where they sense viral products in the intraluminal space.

This is done at the cost of the potential benefits of this new minimally invasive technique. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a transgastric (TG) pure-NOTES procedure in a diagnostic setting. METHODS A TG pure-NOTES procedure with endoscopic ultrasonograpy (EUS)-guided access and over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) closure was performed for 10 pigs in a survival and feasibility study. A full macroscopic necropsy with subsequent histologic evaluation was performed on postoperative day (POD) 14. The outcome parameters were uncomplicated follow-up assessment, survival, intraoperative complications, intraabdominal pathology, macroscopic full-thickness closure, and histology-proven full-thickness healing of the gastrotomy. RESULTS An uncomplicated postoperative course was reported for 9 of the 10 pigs, and survival was reported for all 10 pigs. For all the pigs, EUS-guided access was performed successfully with a median duration of 25 min (range, 12-62 min) and without intraoperative complications or access-related lesions at necropsy. An OTSC closure was achieved with a median duration of 11 min (range, 3-28 min). The OTSC provided immediate closure, but according to the authors' definition of a full-thickness healing evaluated by histologic examination, this was not achieved in any of the cases. Although all the animals survived until POD 14, intraabdominal chronic abscesses were present in 3 of the 10 pigs at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The EUS-guided TG access proved to be feasible without access-related complications. Although OTSC provided an immediate closure, the histopathology raised concerns regarding the risk of perforation. Together with the high risk of intraabdominal infection, TG pure-NOTES is not yet ready for routine clinical practice.","output":"Pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) with ultrasonography-guided transgastric access and over-the-scope-clip closure: a porcine feasibility and survival study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study sought to examine if mental health issues, namely depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness were experienced differently according to various demographic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., a societal stressor).

Respondents (N=661) from lower income households experienced greater anxiety, depression and loneliness. Specifically, loneliness was greater in those with an annual income <$50,000/yr versus higher income brackets. Younger females (18-29yr) displayed greater anxiety, depressive symptoms and loneliness than their male counterparts; this difference did not exist among the other age groups (30-64yr, >65yr). Moreover, loneliness scores increased with increasing depression and anxiety symptom severity category. The relationship between loneliness and depression symptoms was moderated by gender, such that females experienced higher depressive symptoms when encountering greater loneliness.

The primary endpoint was to evaluate the difference in survival rates between patients receiving and not VitD3. The secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical outcomes, such as needing non-invasive ventilation (NIV), ICU transfer, and laboratory findings (inflammatory parameters). Methods: We conducted a retrospective, monocentric matched-cohort study, including patients attending our ward for COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups depending on VitD3 administration (Group A) or not (Group B) among patients with low VitD levels (defined as blood levels < 30 ng/mL), which depended on physicians judgment. Our internal protocol provides VitD3 100,000 UI/daily for two days. Findings: 58 patients were included in Group A, and 58 in Group B. Patients were matched for age, sex, comorbidities, COVID-19-related symptoms, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, blood exams, and medical treatments. Regarding the principal endpoint, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in survival rates [Group A vs. Group B = 3 vs. 11 (p = 0.042)]. When considering secondary endpoints, Group A patients were less likely to undergo NIV [Group A vs. Group B = 12 vs. 23 (p = 0.026)] and showed an improvement in almost all inflammatory parameters. Conclusions: The link between VitD3 deficiency and the clinical course of COVID-19 during hospitalization suggests that VitD3 level is a useful prognostic marker.

A subset analysis was performed to explore the efficacy of TBP by assessing postprogression survival (PPS) after the first event of disease progression. RESULTS Overall, 493 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (n = 330) or placebo (n = 163). With a median follow-up of 38.5 (range 36.1-47.5) months, OS of the nivolumab group was significantly longer compared to the placebo group (median 5.3 vs 4.1 months; 3-year survival rate, 5.6% vs 1.9%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.75], P < 0.0001). The median OS of responders (n = 32) who achieved complete response or partial response was 26.7 months and the 3-year survival rate was 35.5% in the nivolumab group. Overall, 109 patients in the nivolumab group and 37 patients in the placebo group received TBP.

Although it is common to ascertain frailty status utilizing claims-based surrogates (e.g. diagnosis and health service codes) selected according to clinical knowledge, the accuracy of this approach has not yet been examined. We evaluated the accuracy of claims-based surrogates against two clinical definitions of frailty. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Health and Retirement Study subsample of 3097 participants, aged 65 years or older and with at least 12-months of continuous fee-for-service Medicare enrollment. We defined 18 previously utilized claims-based surrogates of frailty from Medicare data and evaluated each against clinical reference standards, ascertained from a direct examination: a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) (range: 0-1) and frailty phenotype. We also compared the accuracy of the total count of 18 claims-based surrogates with that of a validated claims-based FI model, comprised of 93 claims-based variables. RESULTS 19% of participants met clinical criteria for the clinical frailty phenotype. The mean clinical FI for our sample was 0.20 (standard deviation 0.13). Hospital Beds and associated supplies was the claims-based surrogate associated with the highest clinical FI (mean FI 0.49). Claims-based surrogates had low sensitivity ranging from 0.01 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) to 0.38 (malaise and fatigue) and high specificity ranging from 0.79 (malaise and fatigue) to 0.99 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) in discriminating the clinical frailty phenotype. Compared with a validated claims-based FI, the total count of claims-based surrogates demonstrated lower Spearman correlation with the clinical FI (0.41 [95% CI 0.38-0.44] versus 0.59 [95% CI, 0.56-0.61]) and poorer discrimination of the frailty phenotype (C-statistics 0.68 [95% CI, 0.66-0.70] versus 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.77]).

The paper advances an analysis of the knowledge claims that are made in the context of policy applications of behavioural science and compares them with the behavioural research on which they are based. This allows us to show that behavioural policy and the debates accompanying it are based on an oversimplified understanding of what knowledge behavioural science actually provides. Recognising this problem is important as arguments that justify reliance on the behavioural sciences in policy typically presume this simplification.","output":"Knowledge, behaviour, and policy: questioning the epistemic presuppositions of applying behavioural science in public policymaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Adjuvants form an integral component in most of the inactivated and subunit vaccine formulations. Careful and proper selection of adjuvants helps in promoting appropriate immune responses against target pathogens at both innate and adaptive levels such that protective immunity can be elicited. Areas covered: Herein, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants that are licensed for use in human vaccines or in clinical or pre-clinical stages at both innate and adaptive levels. Different pathogens have distinct characteristics, which require the host to mount an appropriate immune response against them. Adjuvants can be selected to elicit a tailor-made immune response to specific pathogens based on their unique properties. Identification of biomarkers of adjuvanticity for several candidate vaccines using omics-based technologies can unravel the mechanism of action of modern and experimental adjuvants. Expert opinion: Adjuvant technology has been revolutionized over the last two decades. In-depth understanding of the role of adjuvants in activating the innate immune system, combined with systems vaccinology approaches, have led to the development of next-generation, novel adjuvants that can be used in vaccines against challenging pathogens and in specific target populations.","output":"Selection of adjuvants for vaccines targeting specific pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term care for older adults is highly affect by the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this rapid review is to understand what we can learn from previous crises or disasters worldwide to optimize the care for older adults in long term care facilities during the outbreak of COVID-19. We searched five electronic databases to identify potentially relevant articles. In total, 23 articles were included in this study.Based on the articles, it appeared that nursing homes benefit from preparing for the situation as best as they can. For instance, by having proper protocols and clear division of tasks and collaboration within the organization. In addition, it is helpful for nursing homes to collaborate closely with other healthcare organizations, general practitioners, informal caregivers and local authorities. It is recommended that nursing homes pay attention to capacity and employability of staff and that they support or relieve staff where possible. With regard to care for the older adults, it is important that staff tries to find a new daily routine in the care for residents as soon as possible. Some practical tips were found on how to communicate with people who have dementia. Furthermore, behavior of people with dementia may change during a crisis. We found tips for staff how to respond and act upon behavior change. After the COVID-19 outbreak, aftercare for staff, residents, and informal caregivers is essential to timely detect psychosocial problems.The consideration between, on the one hand, acute safety and risk reduction (e.g. by closing residential care facilities and isolating residents), and on the other hand, the psychosocial consequences for residents and staff, were discussed in case of other disasters. Furthermore, the search of how to provide good (palliative) care and to maintain quality of life for older adults who suffer from COVID-19 is also of concern to nursing home organizations. In the included articles, the perspective of older adults, informal caregivers and staff is often lacking. Especially the experiences of older adults, informal caregivers, and nursing home staff with the care for older adults in the current situation, are important in formulating lessons about how to act before, during and after the coronacrisis. This may further enhance person-centered care, even in times of crisis. Therefore, we recommend to study these experiences in future research.","output":"[COVID-19 outbreak in nursing homes: what can be learned from the literature about other disasters or crisis situations?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We retrospectively analyzed infectious complications during tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/auto-SCT) in children and adolescents with high-risk or recurrent solid tumors.

Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most common analytical tool for RNA quantification. However, in cases of rare transcripts or inhibiting contaminants in the sample, an extensive amplification could bias the copy number estimation, leading to quantification errors and false diagnosis. Single-molecule techniques may bypass amplification but commonly rely on fluorescence detection and probe hybridization, which introduces noise and limits multiplexing. Here, we introduce reverse transcription quantitative nanopore sensing (RT-qNP), an RNA quantification method that involves synthesis and single-molecule detection of gene-specific cDNAs without the need for purification or amplification. RT-qNP allows us to accurately quantify the relative expression of metastasis-associated genes MACC1 and S100A4 in nonmetastasizing and metastasizing human cell lines, even at levels for which RT-qPCR quantification produces uncertain results. We further demonstrate the versatility of the method by adapting it to quantify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA against a human reference gene. This internal reference circumvents the need for producing a calibration curve for each measurement, an imminent requirement in RT-qPCR experiments. In summary, we describe a general method to process complicated biological samples with minimal losses, adequate for direct nanopore sensing. Thus, harnessing the sensitivity of label-free single-molecule counting, RT-qNP can potentially detect minute expression levels of RNA biomarkers or viral infection in the early stages of disease and provide accurate amplification-free quantification.","output":"Quantification of mRNA Expression Using Single-Molecule Nanopore Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of the research paper was to redevelop the OrgRes Diagnostic tool in order to improve and make it more precise. It was originally developed in partnership with the Resilience Expert Advisory Group (REAG) in Australia and Resilient Organizations in New Zealand. The OrgRes Diagnostic tool allows to determine (measure) the only initial state of organizational resilience of individual organizations or particularly their departments. Design/Methodology/Approach: A Methodology of the survey is based on a questionnaire with twenty six questions used for more effective and precise assessing the potential of resilience measures such as: leadership & culture, change ready and networks & relationships. The results of the analyses were subject of two in-depth interviews for better explanation of the findings. Due to the specific situation during the shutdown of the Polish aviation industry, the survey was directed at the personnel of a selected Polish commercial air transport operator in order to obtain statements describing the potential ofresilience to the crisis caused by the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic. Findings: Therefore, main finding of the survey proves that, the redevelopment of the OrgRes Diagnostic tool allows managers to assess the potential of resilience measures such as, leadership and culture, change ready and networks and relationships in more effective and precise way. Additionally, two sub-measures related to the key resilience capabilities of the organization were identified. Practical Implications: The paper also presents values and benefits that companies can obtain by adopting the improved tool to combat COVID-19, mainly boosting the organizational resilience and minimizing the pandemic risk. Originality/Value: The redeveloped tool is so versatile that it can also be used as measure of resilience potential in other organizations for comparison purposes.

To date, although several preventative vaccines have been approved by FDA and EMA, vaccinated individuals increasingly suffer from breakthrough infections. Therapeutic antibodies may provide an alternative strategy to neutralize viral infection and treat serious cases; however, the clinical data and our experiments show that some FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies lose function against COVID-19 variants such as Omicron. Therefore, in this study, we present a novel therapeutic agent, SICF019, an ACE2-Fc fusion protein whose neutralization efficiency is not compromised, but actually strengthened, by the mutations of dominant variants including Omicron. Comprehensive biophysical analyses revealed the mechanism of increased inhibition to be enhanced interaction of SICF019 with all the tested spike variants, in contrast to monoclonal antibodies which tended to show weaker binding to some variants.

There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.

The metabolism of polydatin, geniposide, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin was significantly inhibited by one or several anti-coronavirus drugs of 100 M around 1 h and 4 h (P<0.05), among which darunavir could strongly reduce the production of genipin (70.6% reduction), quercitin (80.6% reduction) and glycyrrhetinic acid (37.9% reduction), which may cause a high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDI). Additionally, chloroquine reduced the production of genipin and quercitin by more than 75% (P<0.05), whereas arbidol had no significant influence on the metabolism of polydatin, quercitrin and glycyrrhizin (P>0.05) so that its risk may be lower. The inhibition of darunavir on -glucosidase was relatively strong (IC50 = 19323 M), and the inhibition became weaker on -glucuronidase and -rhamnosidase (IC50>500 M). The consistency between gut microflora and glycosidase system indicated that the inhibition of darunavir on the activity of -glucosidase and -glucuronidase may be the main reason for affecting the metabolism of geniposide, glycyrrhizin and polydatin in gut microflora. However, for the inhibition of darunavir and chloroquine on the metabolism of quercetrin, there was no correlation between gut microflora and -rhamnosidase system.

However, there is limited evidence of screening, and vaccination status of this subgroup. The aim of this study was to establish the predictors of screening and completion of the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using respondent driven sampling was used to enrol respondents from twelve out of fifty-seven informal settlements in Kampala city. Data were collected using an electronic structured questionnaire uploaded on the KoboCollect mobile application, and analysed using Stata version 14. A modified Poisson regression analysis was done to determine the predictors of screening while logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of completion of the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule. RESULTS: About 13.3% (102/768) and 2.7% (21/768) of the respondents had ever screened for Hepatitis B, and completed the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule respectively. Being female (aPR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.11C2.33), earning a monthly income >USD 136 (aPR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.11C2.86); completion of the Hepatitis B vaccination schedule (aPR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.26C2.70); lack of awareness about the recommended Hepatitis B vaccine dose (aPR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.27C0.68); and the belief that the Hepatitis B vaccine is effective in preventing Hepatitis B infection (aPRR 3.67, 95% CI: 2.34C5.73) were associated with ever screening for Hepatitis B.

As the virus spread worldwide causing a global pandemic, China reduced transmission at considerable social and economic cost. Post-lockdown, resuming work safely, that is, while avoiding a second epidemic outbreak, is a major challenge. Exacerbating this challenge, Beijing hosts many residents and workers with origins elsewhere, making it a relatively high-risk region in which to resume work. Nevertheless, the step-by-step approach taken by Beijing appears to have been effective so far. To learn from the epidemic progression and return-to-work measures undertaken in Beijing, and to inform efforts to avoid a second outbreak of COVID-19, we simulated the epidemiological progression of COVID-19 in Beijing under the real scenario of multiple stages of resuming work. A new epidemic transmission model was developed from a modified SEIR model for SARS, tailored to the situation of Beijing and fitted using multi-source data. Because of strong spatial heterogeneity amongst the population, socio-economic factors and medical capacity of Beijing, the risk assessment was undertaken spatiotemporally with respect to each district of Beijing. The epidemic simulation confirmed that the policy of resuming work step-by step, as implemented in Beijing, was sufficient to avoid a recurrence of the epidemic. Moreover, because of the structure of the model, the simulation provided insights into the specific factors at play at different stages of resuming work, allowing district-specific recommendations to be made with respect to monitoring at different stages of resuming work .

However, they require the application of the exponentiation several times to obtain a result, which is a time demanding operation implying an extra charge to the computational burden of the method. In this contribution, we propose to reduce the number of exponentiation operations executed by the system, so that the efficiency of the method is enhanced with no alteration of the obtained results. Moreover, the new approach also allows for a reduction on the search space of the evolutionary method carried out in IVTURS. Consequently, we also propose four different approaches to take advantage of this reduction on the search space to study if it can imply an enhancement of the accuracy of the classifier. The experimental results prove: 1) the enhancement of the efficiency of IVTURS and 2) the accuracy of IVTURS is competitive versus that of the approaches using the reduced search space.","output":"Enhancing the Efficiency of the Interval-Valued Fuzzy Rule-Based Classifier with Tuning and Rule Selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmaceutical care describes a philosophy and practice paradigm that calls upon pharmacists to work with other healthcare professionals and patients to achieve optimal health outcomes Among the most accessible health professionals, pharmacists have responsibilities to individual patients and to public health, and this has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic Pharmacists in high-volume community settings provide a growing number of clinical services (i e , immunizations and point-of-care testing), but according to job satisfaction and workplace survey data, demands related to filling prescriptions, insufficient staffing, and working conditions are often not optimal for these enhanced responsibilities and lead to job dissatisfaction Professional codes of ethics require a high level of practice that is currently difficult to maintain due to a number of related barriers In this paper, we summarize recent changes to the scope of practice of pharmacists, cite ethical responsibilities from the American Pharmacists Association Code of Ethics, review data and comments from workplace surveys, and make a call for change Corporate managers, state boards of pharmacy, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility to work with community pharmacists in all settings to find solutions that ensure optimal and ethical patient care Attention to these areas will enhance patient care and increase job satisfaction","output":"Pharmacy Practice in High-Volume Community Settings: Barriers and Ethical Responsibilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) interacts with the ACE2 receptor in human cells and starts the infection of COVID-19 disease.

Symptoms, comorbidities, and socio-demographic factors were recorded in a standardized fashion. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of COVID-19, on the bases of those a model discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver operation curves (AUROC). RESULTS: The final analysis included 930 patients, of which 74 (8%) had COVID-19. Anosmia (OR 10.71; CI 6.07C18.9) and ageusia (OR 9.3; CI 5.36C16.12) were strongly associated with COVID-19. High-risk exposure (OR 12.20; CI 6.80C21.90), especially in the same household (OR 4.14; CI 1.28C13.33), was also correlated; the more household members, especially with flu-like symptoms, the higher the risk of COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and November 2009 in which 250 study participants were selected from a population of 600. Finger prick blood samples were collected after informed consent from participants below 5 years, 5C10 years, and above 10 years of age. Blood was used for microscopy, RDT and dried blood spots. Plasmodium falciparum DNA was extracted by chelex method. Alleles of sera5 and eba-175 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by resolution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Allele calling was done using gel photographs from ethiduim bromide stained gels. Haplotypes of csp were identified by sequencing 63 PCR products using the P. falciparum 7G8 laboratory strain sequence as a reference. The data were analysed using SPSS 16, EQX for windows and Chi-square test was used to calculate associations (P-values), Excel was used to generate graphs. The BioEdit and NCBI blast software programs were used to analyse the sequences from which csp haplotypes map was constructed. RESULTS: Eba-175 FCR3 (48/178) and CAMP (16/178) alleles were observed, the FCR3 (24/67) allele being predominant among children aged below 5 years old while the CAMP (12/67) allele was predominant among older participants. Sera5 alleles ORI (6/204) and ORII (103/204) were observed in the population, ORII was more prevalent and was significantly associated with age (P values < 0.0001), parasite density (P-value < 0.0001) and clinical outcomes (P value = 0.018). There was marked csp diversity in the Th2/Th3 region. Out of 63 sequences, 16 conformed to the reference strain and one (1/16) was similar to a West African haplotype and the majority (14/16) of the haplotypes were unique to this study region. There was an age-dependent distribution of csp haplotypes with more haplotypes being harbored by children < 5-year of age, (10/16) compared to adults (2/16). Interestingly, the csp haplotype corresponding to 3D7 whose prototypical sequence is identical to the sequence of the leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS, S was not observed. CONCLUSION: This data suggest that the eba-175 FCR3 allele, sera5 ORII allele, and csp haplotypes are targets of host immunity and under immune selection pressure in Apac District.

Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of \\"leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity\\" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS: The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m2, P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI. Patients with reduced diffusivity also showed lesser mean values of the lowest hemoglobin levels (8.1 versus 10.2 g/dL, P < .05) and higher serum sodium levels (147 versus 139 mmol/L, P = .04) within 24 hours before MR imaging. The reduced-diffusivity group showed a striking and highly reproducible distribution of confluent, predominantly symmetric, supratentorial, and middle cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight notable correlations between severe COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity and obesity, acute renal failure, mild hypernatremia, anemia, and an unusual brain MR imaging white matter lesion distribution pattern. Together, these observations may shed light on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with leukoencephalopathy, including borderzone ischemic changes, electrolyte transport disturbances, and silent hypoxia in the setting of the known cytokine storm syndrome that accompanies severe COVID-19.","output":"Clinical, Imaging, and Lab Correlates of Severe COVID-19 Leukoencephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized by advanced cognitive deterioration, deposition of A? (amyloid-beta), and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Administration of streptozotocin (STZ) via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route is a reliable model resembling sporadic AD (SAD) associated neuropathological changes. The present study was undertaken to explore the neuroprotective effects of the methoxy flavonoid, umuhengerin, in an STZ-induced SAD mouse model as a potential therapy for AD. Mice were injected once with STZ (3 mg/kg, ICV), followed by daily administration of umuhengerin (orally, 30 mg/kg) or the positive control donepezil (orally, 2.5 mg/kg) for 21 days. The pharmacological activity of umuhengerin was assessed through estimation of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers via mouse ELISA kits, Western blot analysis, and brain histopathological examination. Morris water maze test was also conducted to investigate umuhengerin-induced cognitive enhancement. The results showed that umuhengerin attenuated STZ-produced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress with a notable rise in the expression of Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2). In contrast, it downregulated Keap-1 (Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1), as well as elevated brain contents of GSH (reduced glutathione) and HO-1 (heme oxygenase-1). STZ-injected animals receiving umuhengerin showed marked downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-K?p65) and noticeable increment in the expression of its inhibitor kappa beta alpha protein (IK?), as well as prominent reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), and TNF- (tumor-necrosis factor-alpha) contents. -secretase protein expression and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity were also diminished upon umuhengerin injection in the STZ group, leading to decreased A? formation and cognitive improvement, respectively. In conclusion, umuhengerin neuroprotective effects were comparable to the standard drug donepezil; thus, it could be an alternative approach for AD management.","output":"Umuhengerin Neuroprotective Effects in Streptozotocin-Induced Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model via Targeting Nrf2 and NF-K?

But such successful bottom-up multi-stakeholder engagement tools have yet to emerge in practice. Hence, of specific interest in this study is exploring bottom-up approaches useful for localising the SDGs and harnessing real transformative change to leave no one behind by 2030. Using a case study from the UK, we present a novel integrated mechanism to achieve this. An integrated Social Innovation (SI) and Scenarios Thinking (ST) mechanism remains a valuable bottom-up tool capable of empowering citizens, including the youth and decision-makers in delivering coherent SDGs plans, policies, and programmes. The study reveals that although the SDGs are distinct, they are also interconnected. A scenario development workshop with youth with no prior knowledge of the SDGs showed a common thread of policy measures for different SDG future images. Standard policy measures amongst different SDGs call for an equitable society at all levels;that all energy sources be from clean and renewable sources;investment in low-carbon technologies and research;and financial support for promoting sustainable transportation and consumption measures. This study highlights that we need to change how we think and talk about SDGs and recommends socially innovative steps to embrace cross-sectoral and nexus thinking as the backdrop of the citizen science concept. We conclude that the SDGs should not become a performative exercise or failed social experiment. And any practical localisation from the UNs Member States across the northern and southern hemispheres will require robust measures addressing future-oriented systemic thinking, inclusivity and good governance, together with standards for community resilience and sustainability.","output":"Beyond Agenda 2030: Future-Oriented Mechanisms in Localising the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration of neurons into networks relies on the formation of dendritic spines. These specialized structures arise from dynamic filopodia-like dendritic protrusions. It was recently reported that cortical neurons lacking the channel protein pannexin 1 (PANX1) exhibited higher dendritic spine densities. Here, we expanded on those findings to investigate, at an earlier developmental time point (with more abundant dendritic protrusions), whether differences in the properties of dendritic protrusion dynamics could contribute to this previously discovered phenomenon. Using a fluorescent membrane tag (mCherry-CD9-10) to visualize dendritic protrusions in developing neurons [at 10 d in vitro (DIV10)], we confirmed that lack of PANX1 led to higher protrusion density, while transient transfection of Panx1 led to decreased protrusion density. To quantify the impact of PANX1 expression on protrusion formation, elimination, and motility, we used live cell imaging in DIV10 neurons (one frame every 5 s for 10 min). We discovered that at DIV10, loss of PANX1 stabilized protrusions. Notably, re-expression of PANX1 in Panx1 knock-out (KO) neurons resulted in a significant increase in protrusion motility and turnover. In summary, these new data revealed that PANX1 could regulate the development of dendritic spines, in part, by controlling dendritic protrusion dynamics.","output":"Pannexin 1 Regulates Dendritic Protrusion Dynamics in Immature Cortical Neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Etomidate was associated with an inhibition of adrenal steroid synthesis.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups: (group (E): n = 30) received etomidate 0.2 mg/kg IV followed by etomidate 0.05 mg/kg IV, and (group (KE): n = 30) received ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IV, then etomidate 0.1 mg/kg IV, followed by etomidate 0.05 mg/kg IV. The primary outcome was Serum cortisol level at 6 h after the procedure. RESULTS The mean postoperative cortisol level was significantly lower in group E (295.60  49.218 nmol/L) versus group KE (461.00  67.946 nmol/L), with 95% CI = 351.94 to 404.66; p = 0.000. In addition, the estimated serum cortisol reduction level was also significant between groups; In group E, the estimated cortisol level decreased nearly 53% from 632.40  35.066 nmol/L to 295.60  49.218 nmol/L 6 hours postoperative.

This trial aims to establish the effect on falls of a yoga exercise programme compared with a yoga relaxation programme in community-dwellers aged 60+ years. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial will involve 560 community-dwelling people aged 60+ years. Participants will be randomised to either: (1) the Successful AGEing (SAGE) yoga exercise programme or (2) a yoga relaxation programme. Primary outcome is rate of falls in the 12 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes include mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life, balance self-confidence, physical function, pain, goal attainment and sleep quality at 12 months after randomisation. The number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression models to estimate between-group difference in fall rates. Generalised linear models will assess the effect of group allocation on the continuously scored secondary outcomes, adjusting for baseline scores.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","output":"A Proteome-Wide Immunoinformatics Tool to Accelerate T-Cell Epitope Discovery and Vaccine Design in the Context of Emerging Infectious Diseases: An Ethnicity-Oriented Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are the most common infections transmitted between Hajj pilgrims.

Governments have since relaxed public health restrictions, which resulted in significant outbreaks, shifting the global epicenter of COVID-19 to India. Ongoing systematic public health surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to inform disease prevention policy to re-establish control over the pandemic within South Asia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to inform public health leaders about the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, how South Asia displays differences within and among countries and other global regions, and where immediate action is needed to control the outbreaks. METHODS: We extracted COVID-19 data spanning 62 days from public health registries and calculated traditional and enhanced surveillance metrics. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in South Asia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shifts in variables with a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Traditional surveillance metrics indicate that South Asian countries have an alarming outbreak, with India leading the region with 310,310 new daily cases in accordance with the 7-day moving average. Enhanced surveillance indicates that while Pakistan and Bangladesh still have a high daily number of new COVID-19 cases (n=4819 and n=3878, respectively), their speed of new infections declined from April 12-25, 2021, from 2.28 to 2.18 and 3.15 to 2.35 daily new infections per 100,000 population, respectively, which suggests that their outbreaks are decreasing and that these countries are headed in the right direction. In contrast, India's speed of new infections per 100,000 population increased by 52% during the same period from 14.79 to 22.49 new cases per day per 100,000 population, which constitutes an increased outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation of public health restrictions and the spread of novel variants fueled the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Asia. Public health surveillance indicates that shifts in policy and the spread of new variants correlate with a drastic expansion in the pandemic, requiring immediate action to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

SIT-GA nano-conjugates were prepared according to a full three-factor bilevel (23) factorial design. The SIT concentration (mM, X1), GA concentration (mM, X2), and pH (X3) were selected as the factors. The particle size (nm, Y1) and zeta potential (mV, Y2) were assessed as responses. Characterization of the optimized formula for the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. In addition, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in Vero-E6 epithelial cells previously infected with the virus was investigated. The results revealed that the optimized formula of the prepared complex was a 1:1 SIT:GA molar ratio at a pH of 10, which met the required criteria with a desirability value of 0.878 and had a particle size and zeta potential at values of 77.42 nm and 27.67 V, respectively.

Detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health, including risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), have become an increasing concern. The identification of prospective neurobiological vulnerability markers for developing PTSD symptom during the pandemic is thus of high importance. METHODS: Before the COVID-19 outbreak (September 20, 2019CJanuary 11, 2020), some healthy participants underwent resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) acquisition. We assessed the PTSD symptomology of these individuals during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic (February 21, 2020CFebruary 28, 2020) in China. This pseudo-prospective cohort design allowed us to test whether the pre-pandemic neural connectome status could predict the risk of developing PTSD symptom during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 5.60% of participants (n = 42) were identified as being high-risk to develop PTSD symptom and 12.00% (n = 90) exhibited critical levels of PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic measures of functional connectivity (the neural connectome) prospectively classified those with heightened risk to develop PTSD symptom from matched controls (Accuracy = 76.19%, Sensitivity = 80.95%, Specificity = 71.43%). The trained classifier generalized to an independent sample. Continuous prediction models revealed that the same connectome could accurately predict the severity of PTSD symptoms within individuals (r(2) = 0.31p<.0).

Patients and Methods Subjects between 30 days and 2 years of age were enrolled. Each child received HFNC therapy at different flow rates over time. Three sampling stations with particle counters were deployed to measure aerosol generation and dispersion in the room: station one within 0.5 m of the subject, station two at 2 m, and station three on the other side of the room. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and relative humidity. Station three (far-field) measurements were used to adjust the station one (near-field) measurements for room conditions. Results We enrolled ten children ranging from 6-24 months (median 9 months), two with respiratory illness. Elevated CO2 indicated the near-field measurements were in the breathing plane of the subjects. Near-field breathing plane concentrations of aerosols 0.3-10 microns are elevated by the presence of the patient with no HFNC flow, relative to the room far-field, by 0.45 #/cm3.

This study aimed to validate the French-Canadian and English revised versions of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT-Neuro) for brain-injured ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in three Canadian and one American sites. Patients with a traumatic or a non-traumatic brain injury were assessed with the CPOT-Neuro by trained raters (i.e., research staff and ICU nurses) before, during, and after nociceptive procedures (i.e., turning and other) and non-nociceptive procedures (i.e., non-invasive blood pressure, soft touch). Patients who were conscious and delirium-free were asked to provide their self-report of pain intensity (0C10). A first data set was completed for all participants (n = 226), and a second data set (n = 87) was obtained when a change in the level of consciousness (LOC) was observed after study enrollment. Three LOC groups were included: (a) unconscious (Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS 4C8); (b) altered LOC (GCS 9C12); and (c) conscious (GCS 13C15). RESULTS: Higher CPOT-Neuro scores were found during nociceptive procedures compared to rest and non-nociceptive procedures in both data sets (p < 0.001). CPOT-Neuro scores were not different across LOC groups. Moderate correlations between CPOT-Neuro and self-reported pain intensity scores were found at rest and during nociceptive procedures (Spearman rho > 0.40 and > 0.60, respectively).

Since the discovery of scarless functional healing in fetuses prior to a certain stage of development, scientists have attempted to replicate scarless wound healing in adults with little success. While the extracellular matrix (ECM), fibroblasts, and inflammatory mediators have been historically investigated as separate branches of biology, it has become increasingly necessary to consider them as parts of a complex and tightly regulated system that becomes dysregulated in fibrosis. With this new paradigm, revisiting fetal scarless wound healing provides a unique opportunity to better understand how this highly regulated system operates mechanistically. In the following review, we navigate the four stages of wound healing (hemostasis, inflammation, repair, and remodeling) against the backdrop of adult versus fetal wound healing, while also exploring the relationships between the ECM, effector cells, and signaling molecules. We conclude by singling out recent findings that offer promising leads to alter the dynamics between the ECM, fibroblasts, and inflammation to promote scarless healing. One factor that promises to be significant is fibroblast heterogeneity and how certain fibroblast subpopulations might be predisposed to scarless healing. Altogether, reconsidering fetal wound healing by examining the interplay of the various factors contributing to fibrosis provides new research directions that will hopefully help us better understand and address fibroproliferative diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, systemic sclerosis, progressive kidney disease, and cardiovascular fibrosis.","output":"The interplay of fibroblasts, the extracellular matrix, and inflammation in scar formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES Children in our nation are experiencing the social, emotional, and physical impacts of an unprecedented time in history. Advanced practice nurses prepared as psychiatric clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners bring therapeutic interventions, psychopharmacologic management, and systems thinking to clinical environments of care. Insight into the mental health of youth and families and how clinical nurse specialists may provide solutions for forthcoming challenges is discussed. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT/PROGRAM Barriers to mental healthcare such as the invisibility of nurses at state and federal levels must be eradicated to mitigate the mental health challenges that youth, families, and communities endure. Contemporary issues such as effects of social media, stigma, and suicide present burdens that can be moderated through nursing interventions. OUTCOME The psychiatric clinical nurse specialist provides evidence and community-based nursing interventions that, through early identification and advocacy, contribute to positive mental health outcomes for youth and families. CONCLUSION The need for well-educated advanced practice nurses has never been greater for our vulnerable populations of children, adolescents, and families with mental health challenges. Nurse-delivered programs demonstrate that interventions are necessary for communication, psychoeducation, and prevention of consequences from unacknowledged social media, stigma, and suicide problems.","output":"Caring for the Mental Health of Youth and Families: What is the Role of the Psychiatric Mental Health Advanced Practice Nurse?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted an expedited shift towards expanding telemedicine services. Historically, telemedicine has been shown to increase healthcare access for those in rural communities but widen care gaps for other vulnerable populations by exacerbating existing digital divides and clinician biases in offering telemedicine services. The purpose of this study is to understand the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of patients completing telephone, video, and in-person visits at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Hematology (BWH DOH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients who completed clinical encounters within the BWH DOH between March 19, 2020, when the division switched to virtual visits, and December 31 st, 2020 (pandemic). Patients who completed visits between January 1, 2019 and March 18, 2020 (pre-pandemic) served as a comparator group. Differences in socio-demographic composition of patients completing telephone only (TO), video only (VO), or a mix of in-person and telemedicine visits (IPTM) were tested for significance using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests. Results: A total of 8307 pre-pandemic visits and 5910 pandemic visits were included in analysis. Almost all visits (99.8%) were in-person pre-pandemic compared to 32.4% in-person, 42.6% by telephone, and 25% by video during pandemic. Median age was significantly different between patients who had only pre-pandemic visits, only pandemic visits, and both (55 vs 52 vs 58 years; p=0.003). Otherwise, there was no significant difference in racial and median income distributions pre-pandemic to pandemic. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of patients who completed TO (1536), VO (1065), or IPTM (1518) visits during the pandemic. VO patients were significantly younger than TO and IPTM patients (p<0.001). The majority of patients identified as White (61.3%) with Black and Hispanic patients accounting for 13.8% and 11.4% of the pandemic population, respectively. A higher proportion of White patients had VO visits (29.9%) compared to Black (15.2%) and Hispanic patients (13%) who both had a higher proportion of TO visits (34.7% vs 40.4% vs 50.9%, p<0.001). More patients with a college (29.9%) or post-graduate (34.3%) degree had VO visits than patients with a high school (16.3%) or other levels of education (21.5%) who were more likely to have TO visits (p<0.001). Median household incomes approximated from patient zip codes were significantly higher in patients with VO visits than those with TO or IPTM visits (p<0.001). Discussion: This study shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant differences in the socio-demographic composition of patients completing VO versus TO versus IPTM visits within the BWH DOH. Overall, individuals from groups that historically experience health inequities in the United States including the elderly, African Americans, Hispanics, and those with lower educational levels and socioeconomic status had fewer VO visits and more TO visits compared to patients who were younger, White, and had higher levels of education and socioeconomic status. These differences have important implications as VO visits may offer better clinical interaction when compared to TO visits. The younger age of patients seen during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic suggests that some older adults lost access to hematology care altogether during the pandemic. This disparity pre-pandemic to pandemic was not observed in other demographic subsets. Our work reveals a need to focus on digital inclusion efforts centered around device access, internet access, and digital literacy. Additionally, while TO and VO visits are temporarily equally reimbursed as in person visits under the U.S government's COVID emergency declaration, there has already been a return to markedly lower reimbursement for TO visits. Many practices and hospital system have lost significant revenue due to the pandemic and this differential reimbursement may disincentivize providing care through TO, even if that is the patient's only means of access. This could pose as a further barrier to telemedicine access for individuals from vulnerable populations and exacerbate structural racism, ageism, and other inequities. Care must be taken moving forward that actions to cope with the pandemic or modernize health care serve all patients.

Yet there is currently not a set of agreed comprehensive indicators in Australia. We have developed 79 evidence-based indicators and their corresponding 129 measures of high-quality general practice. This study aims to achieve consensus on relevant and feasible indicators and measures for the Australian context. METHODS: This Delphi consensus study, approved by WSU Human Research Ethics Committee, consists of three rounds of online survey with general practice experts including general practitioners, practice nurses and primary health network staff. The identified indicators and measures are grouped under an attribute framework aligned with the Quadruple Aim, and further grouped under structures, processes and outcomes according to the Donabedian framework. Participants will rate each indicator and measure for relevance and feasibility, and provide comments and recommendations of additional indicators or measures. In the last round, participants will also be asked their views on the implementation of a quality indicator tool. Each indicator and measure will require 70% agreement in both relevance and feasibility to achieve consensus. Aggregated ratings will be statistically analysed for response rates, level of agreement, medians, interquartile ranges and group rankings. Qualitative responses will be analysed thematically using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. DISCUSSION: This protocol will add to the current knowledge of the translation of performance guidelines into quality practice across complex clinical settings and in a variety of different contexts in Australian general practice. The Delphi technique is appropriate to develop consensus between the diverse experts because of its ability to offer anonymity to other participants and minimise bias. Findings will contribute to the design of an assessment tool of high-quality general practice that would enable future primary health care reforms in Australia.","output":"Protocol for a Delphi consensus study to select indicators of high-quality general practice to achieve Quality Equity and Systems Transformation in Primary Health Care (QUEST-PHC) in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is currently no systematic review examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation among athletes. A rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis is important to provide a balanced view of current knowledge on the effect of vitamin D on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and physical performance. OBJECTIVES This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations and physical performance in athletes. METHODS Multiple electronic databases were searched, and study eligibility, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction were completed independently and in duplicate. Studies were stratified by baseline vitamin D sufficiency, season, and latitude. A cut-off of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) of 25(OH)D was used for sufficiency. Absolute mean differences (AMDs) between vitamin D and placebo using random effects analysis, and heterogeneity using Q statistic and I 2 index, were calculated. AMD with 95% confidence interval (CI), p value, and I 2 are reported. RESULTS In total, 13 RCTs (2005-2016) with 532 athletes (vitamin D 311, placebo 221) were eligible. A total of 433 athletes (vitamin D 244, placebo 189) had complete outcome data. Among athletes with baseline values suggesting insufficiency, vitamin D supplementation led to significant increases from 3000 IU (AMD 15.2 ng/ml; 95% CI 10.7-19.7, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 0%) and 5000 IU (AMD 27.8 ng/ml; 95% CI 16.9-38.8, p < 0.0001, I 2 = 78%) per day at >45 latitudes. Both doses led to sufficiency concentrations during winter months. Among athletes with baseline vitamin D suggesting sufficiency, serum 25(OH)D sufficiency was maintained from different doses at both latitudes. Of 13 included trials, only seven measured different physical performances and none demonstrated a significant effect of vitamin D supplementation during 12 weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSION Despite achieving sufficiency in vitamin D concentrations from 3000 IU supplementation, physical performance did not significantly improve. Between-study heterogeneity was large, and well-designed RCTs examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations, physical performance, and injuries in different sports, latitudes, ethnicities, and vitamin D status are needed.","output":"Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations and Physical Performance in Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the molecular evolution of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus as it continues to spread in communities around the globe is important for mitigation and future pandemic preparedness.

Methods Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. Results Fourteen cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IP-10, MCP-3, HGF, MIG and MIP-1, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients.

Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (&#8804;7 days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively.

Pathogen invasion tipically triggers an inflammatory response where acute phase proteins (APP) have a key role. Pentraxins (PTX) are a family of highly conserved APP that play a part in the host defense against infection. The larger proteins of the family are simply named pentraxins, while c-reactive proteins (CRP) and serum amyloid proteins (SAA, SAP) are known as short pentraxins. Although high APP levels have been broadly associated with bacterial infections, there is a growing body of evidence revealing increased PTX, CRP and SAP expression upon viral infection. Furthermore, CRP, PTX and SAP have shown their potential as diagnostic markers and predictors of disease outcome. Likewise, the measurement of APP levels can be valuable to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies and vaccines.

Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. METHODS: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = 3571) in spring and autumn 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = 2328). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6-33.0)) and male students (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7-28.1)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9-13.2)) and male (8.5% (6.6-11.0)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population. Universities should introduce measures to support students in such times of crisis and gain an understanding of the factors impacting mental health positively or negatively and related to university structures and procedures.","output":"Depressive Symptoms in Swiss University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Correlates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper examines whether the intensity of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) during the COVID-19 pandemic has differentially impacted the public sector labor market outcomes This extends the analysis of the already documented negative economic consequences of COVID-19 and their dissimilarities with a typical economic crisis To capture the intensity of the NPIs, we build a novel index (COVINDEX) using daily information on NPIs merged with state-level data on out-of-home mobility (Google data) to show that among individuals living in a typical state, NPI enforcement during COVID-19 reduces the likelihood of being employed (at work) by 5% with respect to the pre-COVID period and the hours worked by 1 3% using data on labor market outcomes from the monthly Current Population Survey and difference-in-difference models This is a sizable amount representing the sector with the higher job security during the pandemic Public sector workers in a typical state are 4 percentage points more likely to be at work than salaried workers in the private sector and 7 percentage points more likely to be at work than self-employed workers (the worst so far) Our results are robust to the endogeneity of the NPI measures and present empirical evidence of heterogeneity in response to the NPIs, with those in local employment being the hardest hit This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","output":"The intensity of COVID-19 Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and labor market outcomes in the public sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Additive manufacturing is the main approach to fabricate freeform and complex shapes specifically when there is a time limit for the production of a part.

At present, evidence lacks to strategize vaccinating the hesitant PLWH. This study has estimated the proportion of PLWH vaccinated till October 2021, enumerated the various adverse events following vaccination, and identified the enabling and constraining factors associated with vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among PLWH by the snowball sampling in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Data were analyzed using the descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses. Results: Two-hundred and forty-seven PLWH responded, out of which 52 (20.7%) were yet to be vaccinated. Seventy-five (30%) participants reported having adverse events, out of which five (7%) had pain at the injection site, and 72 (96%) had systemic reactions. Fever (n = 51, 68%), dizziness (n = 23, 31%), and joint pain (n = 23, 31%) were the major systemic reactions. Among the vaccinated, motivation by the health-care workers and village volunteers were the major enabling factors. On the contrary, uncertainty about the vaccine effects, negative feedback from the health-care workers, and lack of self-motivation were the important constraining factors in taking the vaccines. Conclusion: Some PLWH are still hesitant to take the vaccine.

Between November 2020 and January 2021, 5353 articles were collected and analyzed from the databases of the ResearchGate, Pubmed, and Psycnet websites, subjected to PRISMA methodology. Of these, 11 were evaluated for eligibility, but only three were included in the study because they met all inclusion criteria. The research did not confirm the expected results, showing that any kind of worsening of schizophrenic symptomatology involved the study samples. However, interesting outcomes were highlighted, such as a significant increase in general well-being during the early period of the pandemic, especially by women, or an increase in CPR (C-reactive Protein) levels in the blood, signaling an inflammatory state. Although the systematic review refuted the initial hypothesis, this must be a starting point: the topic is recent and these findings leave ample room for further investigation, particularly in long-term longitudinal research.

Although clinical evidence for PPCs prevention is often unclear and crucial, measures occur to reduce PPCs. One device usually used for this reason is incentive spirometry (IS). The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative incentive spirometry to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, improve postoperative oxygenation, and decrease hospital stay following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients. METHODS: This was a clinical randomized prospective study. A total of 80 patients were selected as candidates for CABG at An-Najah National University Hospital, Nablus-Palestine. Patients had been randomly assigned into two groups: incentive spirometry group (IS), SI performed before surgery (study group) and control group, preoperative spirometry was not performed. The 40 patients in each group received the same protocol of anesthesia and ventilation in the operating room. RESULT: The study findings showed a significant difference between the IS and control groups in the incidence of postoperative atelectasis. There were 8 patients (20.0%) in IS group and 17 patients (42.5%) in the control group (p = 0.03). Mechanical ventilation duration was significantly less in IS group. The median was four hours versus six hours in the control group (p < 0.001). Hospital length of stay was significantly less in IS group, and the median was six days versus seven days in the control group (p < 0.001). The median of the amount of arterial blood oxygen and oxygen saturation was significantly improved in the IS group (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Preoperative incentive spirometry for two days along with the exercise of deep breathing, encouraged coughing, and early ambulation following CABG are in connection with prevention and decreased incidence of atelectasis, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation duration and improved postoperative oxygenation with better pain control.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with excess mortality and household income in rural Bangladesh in 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This repeated survey study is based on an in-person census followed by 2 rounds of telephone calls. Data were collected from a sample of 135 villages within a densely populated 350-km(2) rural area of Bangladesh. Household data were obtained first in person and subsequently over the telephone. For the analysis, mortality data were stratified by month, age, sex, and household education. Mortality rates were modeled by bayesian multilevel regression, and the strata were aggregated to the population by poststratification. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2021. EXPOSURES: Date and cause of any changes in household composition, as well as changes in income and food availability. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality rates were compared for 2019 and 2020, both without adjustment and after adjustment for nonresponse and differences in demographic variables between surveys. Income and food availability reported for January, May, and November 2020 were also compared. RESULTS: Enumerators collected data from an initial 16 054 households in January 2020; 14 551 households (91%) responded when contacted again by telephone in May 2020, and 11 933 households (74%)responded when reached again over the telephone in November 2020, for a total of 58 806 individuals (29 726 female participants [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 26.4 [19.8] years). A total of 276 deaths were reported between February and the end of October 2020 for the subset of the population that could be contacted twice over the telephone, slightly below the 289 deaths reported for the same population over the same period in 2019. After adjustment for survey nonresponse and poststratification, 2020 mortality changed by ?8% (95% CI, ?21% to 7%) compared with an annualized mortality of 6.1 deaths per 1000 individuals in 2019. However, in May 2020, salaried primary income earners reported a 40% decrease in monthly income (from 17 485 to 10 835 Bangladeshi Taka), and self-employed earners reported a 60% decrease in monthly income (23 083 to 8521 Bangladeshi Taka), with only a small recovery observed by November 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of households in rural Bangladesh, all-cause mortality was lower in 2020 compared with 2019. Restrictions imposed by the government may have limited the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural areas, although economic data suggest that these restrictions need to be accompanied by expanded welfare programs.","output":"Assessment of Excess Mortality and Household Income in Rural Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experiences of and concerns about encountering stigma are common among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The REIMS platform coupled with the Harmonic device was shown to produce tissue-specific lipid profiles through the analysis of porcine tissues in both negative and positive ionization modes. Comparison with other methods of electrosurgical dissection, such as monopolar electrosurgery and CO2 laser, showed spectral differences in the profile dependent on the energy device used. The Harmonic device demonstrated major spectral differences in the phospholipid region of m/z 600-1000 compared with the monopolar electrosurgical and CO2 laser-generated spectra. Within the Harmonic REIMS spectra, high intensities of diglycerides and triglycerides were observed. In contrast, monopolar electrosurgical and laser spectra demonstrated high abundances of glycerophospholipids. The Harmonic scalpel was able to differentiate between the liver, muscle, colon, and small intestine, demonstrating 100% diagnostic accuracy.

In 1-3%, the patients declare a hearing loss. Studies in asymptomatic, PCR-positive patients showed a significant hearing loss in the high frequency range. The aim of our follow-up study is to objectify a possible hearing loss in patients tested positive for Covid-19 and to follow it over time. Methods The following tests will be done within the study: ENT examination, audiometry, TPOAE and DPOAE, ERA and ASSR. As a control group, we used ISO 7029:2017 for normal hearing. The examinations are performed after 1, 3 and 6 months after the initial presentation. Results So far 48 patients have been included in the study. In the preliminary analysis, 12 patients reported a subjective hearing loss due to Covid-19 infection. In two patients deafness could be verified. The air conduction threshold (0.25-6kHz) is significantly worse on both sides than in normal hearing patients (p<0.05);especially in the high frequency range (4kHz). In the ASSR, a significantly higher threshold for 0.5;1 and 2kHz (p<0.05) was found compared to the normal values. In stimulation with 4kHz only the threshold on the left is higher, on the right a significance is missed. Conclusion In our preliminary analysis, 25% of patients reported subjective new hearing loss. Objectively, a significant hearing loss in the high frequency range on both sides was found. This could be related to the Covid-19 infection.

However, these same chemicals can exert toxic effects in non-target organisms. To determine chemical modes of action, the toxicity ratio (TR) and critical body residues (CBRs) of 57 pesticides were calculated for Daphnia magna. Results showed that the CBR values of inert compounds were close to a constant while the CBR values of pesticides varied over a wider range. Although herbicides are categorized as specifically-acting compounds to plants, herbicides did not exhibit excess toxicity to Daphnia magna and were categorized as inert compounds with an average logTR = 0.41, which was less than a threshold of one. Conversely, fungicides and insecticides exhibited strong potential for toxic effects to Daphnia magna with an average logTR >2. Many of these chemicals act via disruption of the nervous, respiratory, or reproductive system, with high ligand-receptor binding activity which leads to higher toxicity for Daphnia magna. Molecular docking using acetylcholinesterase revealed that fungicides and insecticides bind more easily with the biological macromolecule when compared with inert compounds. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that the toxicity of fungicides was mainly dependent upon the heat of formation and polar surface area, while the toxicity of insecticides was more related to hydrogen-bond properties. This comprehensive analysis reveals that there are specific differences in toxic mechanisms between fungicides and insecticides. These results are useful for determining relative risk associated with pesticide exposure to aquatic crustaceans, such as Daphnia magna.","output":"Evaluation of modes of action of pesticides to Daphnia magna based on QSAR, excess toxicity and critical body residues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The large-scale COVID-19 pandemic is a severe public health emergency which poses distressing social and economic challenges to the international community as a whole. In order to provide immediate and effective support to affected welfare and healthcare systems as well as to build their lasting, inclusive and sustainable recovery, both the European Union and the United Nations have introduced a number of urgent measures aiming to help and protect citizens and economies. This paper looks into the specificities of urgent procedures launched and carried out by the two most influential international organisations with a view to rapidly respond to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. More specifically, it focuses on the involved institutions and steps of urgent procedures as well as on their most remarkable outcomes. In the case of the European Union, the emphasis is put primarily on two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiatives (CRIIs), adopted during the Croatian Presidency of the Council in one of the fastest legal procedures in the history of the European Union, and the Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU) as an extension of the CRIIs' crisis repair measures. The overarching United Nations' response is assessed through an analysis of its urgent policy agenda developed on the premise that the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a health and socioeconomic emergency but also a global humanitarian, security and human rights crisis. This particularly includes procedures foreseen by the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) and the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP).

Second, it offers a comparative evaluation of the end results of the European and global emergency procedures in mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, it summarises the underlying elements of measures governing the aftermath of the ongoing crisis, i.e. those promoting a human-centred, green, sustainable, inclusive and digital approach to future life.","output":"Triggering Emergency Procedures: a Critical Overview of the Eu's and Un's Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Manual ventilation with a bag-valve device (BVD) is a Basic Life Support skill. Prolonged manual ventilation may be required in resource-poor locations and in severe disasters such as hurricanes, pandemics, and chemical events. In such circumstances, trained operators may not be available and lay persons may need to be quickly trained to do the job. OBJECTIVES The current study investigated whether minimally trained operators were able to manually ventilate a simulated endotracheally intubated patient for six hours. METHODS Two groups of 10 volunteers, previously unfamiliar with manual ventilation, received brief, structured BVD-tube ventilation training and performed six hours of manual ventilation on an electronic lung simulator. Operator cardiorespiratory variables and perceived effort, as well as the quality of the delivered ventilation, were recorded. Group One ventilated a \\"normal lung\\" (compliance 50cmH2O/L, resistance 5cmH2O/L/min). Group Two ventilated a \\"moderately injured lung\\" (compliance 20cmH2O/L, resistance 20cmH2O/L/min). RESULTS Volunteers' blood pressure, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) were stable throughout the study. Perceived effort was minimal. The two groups provided clinically adequate and similar RRs (13.3 [SD = 3.0] and 14.1 [SD = 2.5] breaths/minute, respectively) and minute volume (MV; 7.6 [SD = 2.1] and 7.7 [SD = 1.4] L/minute, respectively).

METHODS: We systematically searched for literature up to September 2020, and included English-language publications of RCTs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We conducted network meta-analysis combining results of both the direct and indirect comparisons of interventions. The efficacy outcomes were clinical progression, all-cause mortality, and viral clearance, and safety outcomes were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. We generated treatment rankings (best to worst) and summarized rank probabilities using rankogram. RESULTS: We included 15 RCTs (14,418 patients) from 7,237 retrieved citations. There was no evidence for efficacy of the assessed antivirals compared with placebo/no treatment or with another antiviral for all efficacy outcomes. Lopinavir (400 mg)/ritonavir (100 mg) significantly increased diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting compared with placebo/no treatment and other antivirals, and was ranked worst for these outcomes, while triazavirin (250 mg), baloxavir marboxil (80 mg), and remdesivir (100 mg C 10 days) ranked best, respectively.

Many have expressed concern that the risk of flawed decision-making is increased by relying on preprint data that would not survive peer review. We therefore asked how much the information presented in preprints is expected to change after review. We quantify attrition dynamics of over 1000 epidemiological estimates first reported in 100 matched preprints studying COVID-19. We find that 89% of point estimates persist through peer review. Of these, the correlation between preprint and published estimate values is extremely high at 0.99, and there is no systematic trend toward estimate inflation or deflation during review. A higher degree of data alteration during peer review, either in terms of magnitude or deletion, might be expected in papers never published because of their lower quality, which could limit the generalizability of our results. Importantly, we find that expert peer review scores of preprint quality are not related to eventual publication in a peer reviewed journal, mitigating this concern. Uncertainty is reduced somewhat, however, as authors add another 18% of data points compared to the preprint version. Confidence interval ranges also decrease by a small but statistically significant 7%. Therefore, the evidence base presented in preprints is highly stable, and where data change during review, uncertainty is expected to decrease by a small amount on average.

This is a descriptive report of communicable disease surveillance in Central Queensland (CQ) for six months (1 April to 30 September 2020) after the introduction of physical distancing and wider lockdown measures in Queensland. The counts of notifiable communicable diseases in CQ in the six months were observed and compared with the average for the same months during the years 2015 to 2019. During the study's six months, there were notable decreases in notifications of most vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pertussis and rotavirus. Conversely, notifications increased for disease groups such as blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections and vector-borne diseases. There were no reported notifications for dengue fever and malaria which are mostly overseas acquired. The notifications of some communicable diseases in CQ were variably affected and the changes correlated with the implementation of the COVID-19 public health measures. Background The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to some significant changes to local, regional and national public health practices including social distancing and wider lockdown. These measures have been previously reported to be associated with reductions in the incidence of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases as well as of other airborne transmitted agents.1,2 A preliminary analysis was conducted assessing the impact of these measures on nationally notifiable diseases across Australia;3 however, the impact of these measures on communicable diseases within regional Australia is not well established. Like most regional areas, Central Queensland (CQ) has a lower population density and considerable distance from major cities; it will be informative to understand how these measures impact on notifiable conditions in this regional setting. We aimed to identify the patterns of change in reported notifiable conditions to the Central Queensland Public Health Unit (CQPHU), during a six-month period (1 April to 30 September 2020) following the implementation of COVID-19 measures. Here, we compare these notifications to the surveillance data for the same six-month period for the previous five years (2015 to 2019). Methods The study encompasses all notifiable conditions reported from CQ, which covers approximately 226,000 population and is spread over 117,588 square kilometres. Communicable diseases data were retrieved from the Queensland Notifiable Conditions System (NoCS), an online epidemiological database, from 1 January 2015 to 30 September 2020. The data were collected under the Public Health Act 2005, a legislative authority that provides permission to access health information. Permission to publish was given by the Communicable Diseases Branch of Queensland. Data were extracted on selected notifiable diseases in Queensland: blood-borne viruses (BBV), gastrointestinal diseases, sexually transmissible infections (STIs), vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), vector-borne diseases, zoonotic diseases and other diseases. For each disease, the count for six months following the implementation of COVID-19 public health measures (1 April to 30 September 2020) was compared with the average for the same six-month period during the years 2015 to 2019. Results From 1 April to 30 September 2020, after the implementation of Queensland's COVID-19 preventive measures, there was a decrease seen in several diseases notifications reported to the CQPHU, mostly VPDs, when compared with the same months for each of 2015 to 2019 and for the 5-year average (2015-2019) for those months (Table 1).

METHODS Using data from the MR CLEAN Registry, we compared patients with active cancer (defined as cancer diagnosed within 12 months prior to stroke, metastatic disease, or current cancer treatment) to patients without cancer. Outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, mortality, successful reperfusion (eTICI scores2b), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and recurrent stroke. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with a pre-stroke mRS score of 0 or 1 and according to treatment setting (curative or palliative). Analyses were adjusted for prognostic variables. RESULTS Of 2583 patients who underwent EVT, 124 (4.8%) had active cancer. They more often had pre-stroke disability (mRS2: 34.1% vs. 16.6%). The treatment setting was palliative in 25.3% of the patients. There was a shift towards worse functional outcome at 90 days in patients with active cancer (adjusted common OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.2). At 90 days, patients with active cancer were less often independent (mRS 0-2: 22.6% vs. 42.0%, aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), and more often dead (52.2% vs. 26.5%, aOR 3.2, 95% CI 2.1-4.9).

Recurrent stroke within 90 days was more common in patients with active cancer (4.0% vs. 1.3%, aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-8.1). The sensitivity analysis of patients with a pre-stroke mRS of 0 or 1 showed that patients with active cancer still had a worse outcome at 90 days (acOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.0). Patients with active cancer in a palliative treatment setting regained functional independence less often compared to patients in a curative setting (18.2% vs. 32.1%) and mortality was also higher (81.8% vs. 39.3%). CONCLUSIONS Despite similar technical success, patients with active cancer had significantly worse outcomes after EVT for AIS. Moreover, they had an increased risk of recurrent stroke. Nevertheless, about a quarter of the patients regained functional independence and the risk of other complications, most notably sICH, was not increased.

Under-reporting of cases and a younger population could partly account for these differences, but pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses is another potential factor. Blood samples from Sierra Leonean Lassa fever and Ebola survivors and their contacts collected before the first reported COVID-19 cases were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the presence of antibodies binding to proteins of coronaviruses that infect humans. Results were compared to COVID-19 subjects and healthy blood donors from the United States. Prior to the pandemic, Sierra Leoneans had more frequent exposures than Americans to coronaviruses with epitopes that cross-react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The percentage of Sierra Leoneans with antibodies reacting to seasonal coronaviruses was also higher than for American blood donors. Serological responses to coronaviruses by Sierra Leoneans did not differ by age or sex. Approximately a quarter of Sierra Leonian pre-pandemic blood samples had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, while about a third neutralized MERS-CoV pseudovirus.

Some of these techniques may provide insights for understanding crime and disorder, especially, via interpreting the weights for the spatial covariates based on regression modelling. However, to date, the use of temporal covariates for the time domain has not played a significant role in the analysis. In this work, we collect time-stamped crime-related news articles, infer crime topics or themes based on the collection and associate the topics with the historical numeric crime counts. We provide a proof-of-concept study, where instead of adopting spatial covariates, we focus on temporal (or dynamic) covariates and assess their utility.

METHODS 120,409 adults with newly diagnosed T2DM from 2000-2018 were classified by the number of prevalent and incident comorbidities. Face to face and telephone primary care consultations with a nurse or physician were obtained. Crude and sex-age adjusted annual consultation rates and associated costs were calculated based on the number of comorbidities at the time of consultation. RESULTS The crude rate of face to face primary care consultations for patients without comorbidities was 10.3 (95% CI 10.3-10.4) per person year, 12.7 (12.7-12.7) for 1 comorbidity, 15.1 (15.1-15.2) for 2 comorbidities, and 18.7 (18.7-18.8) for 3 or more comorbidities. The mean annual inflation-adjusted cost for face to face consultations was 412.70 per patient without comorbidities, 516.80 for 1 comorbidity, 620.75 for 2 comorbidities, and 778.83 for 3 or more comorbidities. The age-sex adjusted face to face consultation rate changed an average of -3.3% (95% CI -4.4% to -2.3%) per year from 2000 to 2018 for patients without comorbidities, -2.7% (-4.0% to -1.3%) for 1 comorbidity, -2.2% (-3.3% to -1.2%) for 2 comorbidities, and -4.3% (-8.7% to +0.3%) for 3 or more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Though consultation rates for all patients decreased from 2000-2018, there was a significant disparity between the rate for patients with and without comorbidities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phenomenological descriptive qualitative study reported staff and students' experiences during the pandemic through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. These were recorded on audio and video with a digital platform. Three researchers then transcribed and analyzed the recordings and codified the answers into categories to determine the emerging topics until a saturation point was reached. RESULTS: The core emerging themes among the staff group were (1) change in the personal/professional life balance, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) staff perceptions of students' learning experiences, and (4) concerns about the future. For students, the themes were (1) changes in the learning process, (2) online learning through digital platforms, (3) interpersonal relationships, and (4) concerns about the future. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of learning for our dental school staff and students.

It is caused by the novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic infection or flu like symptoms to serious pneumonia which could be associated with multiple organ failure possibly leading to death. It is understood that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 includes all elements of the immune system which could altogether succeed in viral elimination and complete cure. Meanwhile, this immune response may also lead to disease progression and could be responsible for the patients death. Many trials have been done recently to create therapies and vaccines against human coronavirus infections such as MERS or SARS, however, till now, there is some controversy about the effectiveness and safety of antiviral drugs and vaccines which have been developed to treat and prevent this disease and its management depends mainly on supportive care. The spike glycoprotein or protein S of SARS-CoV-2 is the main promoter that induces development of neutralizing antibodies; hence, many attempts of vaccines and antiviral drugs development have been designed to be directed specifically against this protein. While some of these attempts have been proved to be efficient in in vitro settings, only few of them have been proceeded to randomized animal trials and human studies which makes COVID-19 prevention an ongoing challenge.

Typically, these sessions are separated by at least 48 h recovery on the assumption that such efforts elicit marked fatigue of the central nervous system (CNS), but this posit has not been well studied. The aim of the study was to assess the etiology and recovery of fatigue after heavy-resistance (strength), jump, and sprint training methods. METHODS Ten male athletes completed three training sessions requiring maximal efforts that varied in their loading characteristics: (i) heavy-resistance exercise (10  5 back squats at 80% one-repetition maximum [1RM]) (STR), (ii) jumping exercise (10  5 jump squats) (JUMP), and (iii) maximal sprinting (15  30 m) (SPR). Preparticipants, postparticipants, and 24-, 48-, and 72-h postparticipants completed a battery of tests to measure neuromuscular function using electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve, and single- and paired-pulse magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, with evoked responses recorded from the knee extensors. Fatigue was self-reported at each time point using a visual analog scale. RESULTS Each intervention elicited fatigue that resolved by 48 (JUMP) and 72 h (STR and SPR). Decrements in muscle function (reductions in the potentiated quadriceps twitch force) persisted for 48 h after all exercise. Reductions in voluntary activation were present for 24 h after JUMP and SPRINT, and 48 h after STR. No other differences in CNS function were observed as a consequence of training.

Quercetin has strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties, and it is characterized by a very high safety profile, exerted in animals and in humans. Like most other polyphenols, quercetin shows a very low rate of oral absorption and its clinical use is considered by most of modest utility. Quercetin in a delivery-food grade system with sunflower phospholipids (Quercetin Phytosome(?), QP) increases its oral absorption up to 20-fold. METHODS: In the present prospective, randomized, controlled, and open-label study, a daily dose of 1000 mg of QP was investigated for 30 days in 152 COVID-19 outpatients to disclose its adjuvant effect in treating the early symptoms and in preventing the severe outcomes of the disease. RESULTS: The results revealed a reduction in frequency and length of hospitalization, in need of non-invasive oxygen therapy, in progression to intensive care units and in number of deaths. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties.

The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5-10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts. The incidence for the first wave in Germany can be estimated as 0.4-1.8% and excess mortality could not be observed.","output":"[SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19-epidemiology and prevention]./ SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 - Epidemiologie und Pr?vention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both the air quality index (AQI) and indicatory air pollutants of Anqing, Hefei, and Suzhou near central China from 2017 to 2019, and the impact of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control actions on air quality were investigated.

The highest (AQI average of 112.6) was in winter, for which the proportions were 7.4%, 39.5%, 33.3%, 12.5%, 7.2%, and 0.1%, respectively. PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2in order were the most important indicatory air pollutants for AQI classes IV, V, and VI, which all prevailed in winter and spring, while O 3was the indicatory air pollutant that occurred most in summer. The COVID-19 event, which triggered global attention, broke out at the end of 2019. This study also investigated and compared the air quality levels in the three cities from January to March 2017C2019 with those in 2020. The results showed that during February 2020, in the three cities, the average ambient air concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO 2, CO, and NO 2were 41.9 g m C3, 50.1 g m C3, 2.18 ppb, 0.48 ppm, and 8.97 ppb, and were 46.5%, 48.9%, 52.5%, 36.2%, and 52.8%, respectively, lower than those in the same month in 2017C2019, respectively. However, the O 3average concentration (80.6 ppb) did not show significant fluctuations and even slightly increased by 3.6%. This is because a lower concentration of NO 2resulted in constraints on the reaction of NO + O 3, so the O 3level could not be effectively further reduced. In addition, this study also analyzed and compared the five highest daily AQIs from February 2017C2019 with those of 2020 for the three cities. The mean AQI for the 5 days with the highest daily AQI (averaged 122.6) in February 2020 was 45.1% lower than that for February 2017C2019 (averaging 223.2), and the indicatory air pollutant was always PM 2.5, which decreased by 46.7% (from 173.6 to 92.6 g m C3).

DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey study collected responses from 13 April 2020 until 30 April 2020. Students at US allopathic medical schools completed the survey online. RESULTS: 1,668 responses were analyzed. A total of 337 (20.2%) respondents thought the pandemic would affect their choice of specialty, with differences across class years: 15.2% (53) of first-years (MS1s), 26.4% (92) of second-years (MS2s), 23.7% (162) of third-years (MS3s), and 9.7% (22) of fourth-years (MS4s) (p < 0.0001). Among all classes, the most common reason chosen was inability to explore specialties of interest (244, 72.4%), and the second was inability to bolster their residency application (162, 48.1%). Out of the MS3s who chose the latter, the majority were concerned about recommendation letters (68, 81.0%) and away rotations (62, 73.8%). As high as 17.4% (119) of MS3s said they were more likely to take an extra year during medical school as a result of the pandemic. Region of the US, number of local COVID cases, and number of local COVID deaths had no effect on whether respondents thought the pandemic would affect their specialty choice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that about one-fifth of surveyed medical students currently believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect their choice of specialty, with many of these citing concerns that they cannot explore specialties or obtain recommendation letters. With prolonged suspension of clinical rotations, targeted efforts by medical schools to address these concerns through enhanced virtual curriculum development and advising strategies will become increasingly important.

Heart rate, heart rate variability in the low (LF-HRV) and high frequency (HF-HRV) domain, blood pressure and affective wellbeing were assessed. As expected, both paced breathing and paced singing resulted in elevated LF-HRV. Moreover, both singing groups evidenced increases in heart rate, blood pressure and positive affect, thus indicating elevated sympathetic activation. Breathing and singing at 0.1 Hz had no robust effect on cardiovascular stress reactivity. Findings suggest that paced singing could constitute a promising alternative to slow paced breathing as it increases cardiovascular coherence, although more studies are needed to elucidate whether slow breathing and/or singing could ameliorate acute stress responses.","output":"Singing at 0.1 Hz as a Resonance Frequency Intervention to Reduce Cardiovascular Stress Reactivity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study empirically investigates the complex interplay between the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, mobility changes in retail and recreation, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas, and lockdown measures in 88 countries around the world during the early phase of the pandemic To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e g , Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer) A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing so as to reduce the risk of infection However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e g , USA, UK, Italy, and Spain) Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic","output":"COVID-19 pandemic severity, lockdown regimes, and people's mobility: early evidence from 88 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of the article is to describe the changes in managing the peer learning system in the Department of Abdominal Imaging at our institution during the pandemic and its restrictions.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and without oversight from professional organizations, many departments individually generated WFH policies. This study reports WFH policies and perceived impact on workflow and work-life balance within United States (US) academic RO departments for both residents and faculty. MATERIALS/METHODS An IRB-approved questionnaire was developed and sent to one resident and one faculty member at each of the 92 US academic RO departments. Purposive sampling for residents and faculty was utilized. For residents, this consisted of the most senior resident and for faculty, a senior faculty member or the program director. If no reply was obtained after 3 weeks, an alternate member was selected. The survey remained open for 75 days. Categorical and continuous variables, along with free-responses were aggregated and reported. RESULTS 135 responses (residents n = 65, faculty n = 70) were received, representing 70.7% and 77.2% of the 92 programs respectively. A new WFH policy was reported by 83% faculty (58/70) and 92% residents (60/65), predominantly initiated within 2 months of the pandemic (60% faculty and 79% residents respectively). The initial WFH policy allowed moderate WFH for 40% faculty and 46% residents, while minimal WFH was offered for 30% faculty and 32% residents. Full WFH was reported by 14% of respondents in both categories. Policies have since contracted for 39% faculty and 62% of residents, being revoked for 11% of faculty and 22% of residents. 15/70 (21.4%) faculty and 12/65 (18.5%) residents report dissatisfaction with their current WFH policy. 18/70 (25.7%) faculty and 14/65 (21.5%) residents perceived negative sentiments from others regarding utilization of WFH. On a 4-point scale, residents and faculty reported personal/family life, research, and day-to-day productivity were positively impacted by WFH policy, while patient care was perceived as negatively impacted. No difference was reported for leadership or education. CONCLUSION A variety of WFH policies have been adopted in RO.

These challenges have been enormous and debilitating, as the infrastructure of many countries including developing ones had little, or no resources to deal with the crisis. Even in developed countries like Italy, health systems have been so inundated by cases that health care facilities became oversaturated and could not accommodate the unexpected influx of patients to be tested. Initially, resources were focused on testing to identify those who were infected. When it became clear that the virus mainly attacks the lungs by causing parenchymal changes in the form of multifocal pneumonia of different levels of severity, imaging became paramount in the assessment of disease severity, progression, and even response to treatment. As a result, there was a need to establish protocols for imaging of the lungs in these patients. In North America, the focus was on chest x-ray and CT as these are widely available and accessible at most health facilities. However, in Europe and China, this was not the case and a cost-effective and relatively fast imaging modality was needed to scan a large number of sick patients promptly. Hence, ultrasound found its way into the hands of Chinese and European physicians and has since become an important imaging modality in those locations. Ultrasound (US) is a highly versatile, portable, and inexpensive imaging modality which has application across a broad spectrum of conditions and in this way is ideally suited to assess the lungs of COVID-19 patients in the ICU. This bedside test can be done with little to no movement of the patients from the unit which keeps them in their isolated rooms, thereby limiting further exposure to other health personnel. This paper presents a basic introduction to COVID-19 and the use of ultrasound for lung imaging. It further provides a high-level overview of the existing ultrasound technologies which are driving development in current and potential future US imaging systems for lung, with a specific emphasis on portable and 3D systems.","output":"Current Ultrasound Technologies and Instrumentation in the Assessment and Monitoring of COVID-19 Positive Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A 37-year- old man was diagnosed with HIV-1 in November 2018, following a negative test in July 2018. Baseline HIV viral load was 56882 cps/ml and CD4 610 cells/mm3 (32%). HLA B5701 was negative and genotype showed wild-type virus. Baseline ALT was 54 IU/L but this was felt to be related to recent seroconversion. He was commenced on abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (Triumeq) and achieved full viral suppression after 4 weeks. Method: Over the course of 2019, his ALT ranged from 40-150 IU/L with associated occasional rises in AST to around 80 IU/L;bilirubin, ALP and GGT remained within normal limits. He reported no other prescribed or over the counter medication including gym supplements, steroid use or recreational drugs and alcohol consumption was <7 units/week. Extensive investigation for causes of transaminitis were all within normal ranges/negative and hepatic ultrasound was normal. We referred him to hepatology and continued monthly liver tests, pending review. His transaminitis worsened and by Nov 2020 ALT 501 IU/L/ AST 200 IU/L and an urgent liver biopsy was arranged. By Dec 2020 ALT 997 IU/L, AST 316 IU/L and we decided to stop his Triumeq as there was no other explanation for his liver inflammation. Results: The patient later disclosed the use of anabolic steroids during 2020 due to Covid-19 gym closures but he had stopped these in November. His transaminases improved immediately upon cessation of Triumeq and within 14 days ALT was 354 and AST 130. Conclusion: Liver biopsy histopathology showed changes in keeping with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) that was not consistent with typical patterns seen with anabolic steroid use.

Several hyperpolarized sensor molecules have been introduced that enable high sensitivity detection of metabolism and physiological parameters. However, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) often suffers from poor signal-to-noise ratio and spectral analysis is complicated by peak overlap. Here, we study measurements of extracellular pH (pH(e)) by hyperpolarized zymonic acid, where multiple pH(e) compartments, such as those observed in healthy kidney or other heterogeneous tissue, result in a cluster of spectrally overlapping peaks, which is hard to resolve with conventional spectroscopy analysis routines. METHODS: We investigate whether deep learning methods can yield improved pH(e) prediction in hyperpolarized zymonic acid spectra of multiple pH(e) compartments compared to conventional line fitting. As hyperpolarized (13)C-MRSI data sets are often small, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) were trained with either a synthetic or a mixed (synthetic and augmented) data set of acquisitions from the kidneys of healthy mice. RESULTS: Comparing the networks performances compartment-wise on a synthetic test data set and eight real kidney data shows superior performance of CNN compared to MLP and equal or superior performance compared to conventional line fitting. For correct prediction of real kidney pH(e) values, training with a mixed data set containing only 0.5% real data shows a large improvement compared to training with synthetic data only. Using a manual segmentation approach, pH maps of kidney compartments can be improved by neural network predictions for voxels including three pH compartments. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that CNNs offer a reliable, accurate, fast and non-interactive method for analysis of hyperpolarized (13)C MRS and MRSI data, where low amounts of acquired data can be complemented to achieve suitable network training.","output":"Prediction of multiple pH compartments by deep learning in magnetic resonance spectroscopy with hyperpolarized (13)C-labelled zymonic acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing pneumonia and identifying those requiring antibiotherapy remain challenging.

We assessed the effectiveness of mechanical circulatory support using a micro-axial percutaneous assist device in preventing acute hemodynamic decompensation. METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-six consecutive patients with structural heart disease undergoing 28 ventricular tachycardia ablations between May 2013 and October 2017 were included. All patients presenting with left ventricular ejection fraction < 25%, symptomatic heart failure and arrhythmia associated hemodynamic decompensation underwent catheter ablation with mechanical circulatory support (Impella 2.5?; Impella CP?, Abiomed, Danvers, MA, USA). Electro-anatomic mapping was performed using Ensite? NavX? (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) or Rhythmia? (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) mapping systems. Mapping/ablation strategy included substrate and activation mapping/ablation. Of the 26 patients, 80 % had ischemic cardiomyopathy, mean age was 689 years; mean left ventricular ejection fraction 19.63%, mean PAAINESD score was 213. Mean tachycardia cycle length was 34876 ms (range: 280-500 ms). The assist device was used pre-emptively in 25 patients and as rescue therapy in one patient. All ventricular tachycardias occurring during substrate ablation were activation mapped and ablated. The ablation procedure was accomplished in 25 0f 26 patients, acute decompensation occurred only in one patient receiving circulatory support as bail-out therapy. CONCLUSION In patients with advanced heart failure and a high probability of acute hemodynamic decompensation during catheter ablation, mechanical circulatory support prevented acute decompensation in 25 of 26 patients.

Importantly, they indicated how well their work-related basic needs, i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness, were met when working from home and how these needs had been met in the office. Multilevel models of growth showed that work engagement, flow, affect and detachment were on average positive and improving over the two weeks in study. Higher competence need satisfaction predicted better daily work engagement, flow, and affect. In a network model, we explored associations and dynamics between daily variables. Overall, the results suggest that people adapted well to the novel situation, with their motivation and well-being indicators showing adequate levels and increasing trajectories. Avenues for improving work from home are job control and social support.","output":"Having to Work from Home: Basic Needs, Well-Being, and Motivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we have analysed the COVID-19 progression in India and the three most affected Indian states (viz Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) as of 29-Aug-20 and developed a prediction model to forecast the behaviour of COVID-19 spread in the future months We used time series data for India and applied the Susceptible-Infective-Removed (SIR) model and the FbProphet model to predict the peak infectives and peak infective date for India and the three most affected states In this paper, we further performed the comparative analysis of the prediction results from SIR and FbProphet models From this study, we concluded that with the assumption that a total 5% of India's population might be infected by the pandemic, the countrywide spread is forecasted to reach its peak by the end of Nov-20 And till the time there is no vaccination, for the states that have already reached their peak and with festivals around the corner, there are high chances of resurgence in the number of cases if the social distancing and other control measures are not followed diligently in the coming months ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19 Pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a theoretical investigation of structural, optical, and phosphorescence properties of four cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes containing substituted 2-(2-thienyl)pyridine ligands using DFT and TD-DFT methods.

INTRODUCTION: The first wave of the COVID-19 crisis was associated with a reduction of patients presenting with acute cardiovascular disease. However, there is only limited data showing the trend of pacemaker implantations and their indications. PURPOSE: To evaluate pacemaker implantations before, during and after the first COVID-19 wave, stratified by indication. METHODS: We analysed the weekly rates of pacemaker implantation at our centre during the first national lockdown for COVID-19 at the between 16 March 2020 and 29 April 2020 (weeks 12-17 / 2020), compared to the implantation rates 6 weeks before (weeks 6-11 / 2020), 6 weeks afterwards (weeks 18-23 / 2020), and the same time frame in 2017-2019. To reduce bias due to postponed planned procedures, we stratified pacemaker implantations into the following groups: total implantations (including box changes), new pacemaker implantations, implantation due to AV block, implantation due to supraventricular conduction disturbances, and other implantations. RESULTS: The total number of total weekly implantations was reduced from 10.7 (weeks 6-11 / 2020) to 4.2 (weeks 12-17 / 2020; -60.1%, p = 0.02). We found no significant reduction in the same time frame in 2017-2019 (6.5 vs. 6.1 per week, p = 0.29). We found a similar effect in \\"new\\" pacemaker implantations (8.5 vs. 3.2 per week, -62.7%, p = 0.02) and AV block (5.0 vs. 1.5 per week, -70%, p = 0.03). There was no reduction in pacemaker implantation due to sick sinus syndrome (2.5 vs. 0.8 per week, -66.7%, p = 0.12) and other indications (1.0 vs. 0.8 per week, -16.7%, p = 0.86). In the six following weeks (18-23 / 2020), the total numbers (6.0 per week) and indications other than AV block rose to baseline (p > 0.05), but patients with AV block were still less prevalent (1.7 per week, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The reduction of total and new pacemaker implantations during the COVID-19 lockdown was mainly based on a reduced pacemaker implantation rate for AV block. This effect persisted even after the national lockdown. This analysis implies that a significant number of patients with AV block may have avoided medical contact during and after the lockdown and therefore have experienced increased mortality.","output":"Lower pacemaker implantation rates for atrioventricular block during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Feelings of isolation, insecurity, and instability triggered by COVID-19 could have a long-term impact on the mental health status of individuals. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Findings: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

Clinical characteristics and follow-up data of MIS-C in infants have not been well described. We sought to describe the clinical course, laboratory findings, therapeutics and outcomes among infants diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS: Infants of age <12 months with MIS-C were identified by reports to the CDC's MIS-C national surveillance system. Data were obtained on clinical signs and symptoms, complications, treatment, laboratory and imaging findings, and diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. Jurisdictions that reported 2 or more infants were approached to participate in evaluation of outcomes of MIS-C. RESULTS: Eighty-five infants with MIS-C were identified and 83 (97.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; median age was 7.7 months. Rash (62.4%), diarrhea (55.3%) and vomiting (55.3%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. Other clinical findings included hypotension (21.2%), pneumonia (21.2%) and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (13.9%). Laboratory abnormalities included elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, d-dimer and fibrinogen. Twenty-three infants had follow-up data; 3 of the 14 patients who received a follow-up echocardiogram had cardiac abnormalities during or after hospitalization. Nine infants had elevated inflammatory markers up to 98 days postdischarge. One infant (1.2%) died after experiencing multisystem organ failure secondary to MIS-C.

However, well-done systematic reviews are expensive, time-demanding, and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic document classification approach to significantly reduce the effort in reviewing documents. Methods: We first describe a manual document classification procedure that is used to curate a pertinent training dataset and then propose three classifiers: a keyword-guided method, a cluster analysis-based refined method, and a random forest approach that utilizes a large set of feature tokens. As an example, this approach is used to identify documents studying female sex workers that are assumed to contain content relevant to either HIV or violence. We compare the performance of the three classifiers by cross-validation and conduct a sensitivity analysis on the portion of data utilized in training the model. Results: The random forest approach provides the highest area under the curve (AUC) for both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision/recall (PR). Analyses of precision and recall suggest that random forest could facilitate manually reviewing 20\\\\% of the articles while containing 80\\\\% of the relevant cases. Finally, we found a good classifier could be obtained by using a relatively small training sample size.

Methods: The Qatar national COVID-19 testing database was analyzed. This database includes a total of 2,688,232 RT-PCR tests conducted between February 5, 2020-January 27, 2021. Logistic regression analyses were implemented to identify predictors of infection and to derive the COVID-19 risk score, as a tool to identify those at highest risk of having the infection. Score cut-off was determined using the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve based on maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. The score performance diagnostics were assessed. Results: Logistic regression analysis identified age, sex, and nationality as significant predictors of infection and were included in the risk score. The score scoring points were lower for females compared to males and higher for specific nationalities. The ROC curve was generated and the area under the curve was estimated at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.63-0.63). The score had a sensitivity of 59.4% (95% CI: 59.1%-59.7%), specificity of 61.1% (95% CI: 61.1%-61.2%), a positive predictive value of 10.9% (95% CI: 10.8%-10.9%), and a negative predictive value of 94.9% (94.9%-95.0%).

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung injury and death in the most severe cases. The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a major health issue worldwide. Immune dysregulation characterized by altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to the pathology of COVID-19 patients, which is a testimony of the fundamental role of the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we further characterized the host cell antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by using primary human airway epithelia and immortalized model cell lines. We mainly focused on the type I and III interferon (IFN) responses, which lead to the establishment of an antiviral state through the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that both primary airway epithelial cells and model cell lines elicit a robust immune response characterized by a strong induction of type I and III IFN through the detection of viral pathogen molecular patterns (PAMPs) by melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5. However, despite the high levels of type I and III IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication, whereas IFN pre-treatment strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions.

Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed to control the disease, and an array of personal hygiene measures has been introduced. As a result, information that will support and promote vaccination among populations as well as other health measures against COVID-19 are urgently needed. The goal of this research was to look into the knowledge about COVID-19 and how it relates to preventive behaviors and vaccination among people living in rural areas of northern Thailand. (2) Methods: a cross-sectional study was performed in four upper northern provinces of Thailand. A total of 1524 participants were recruited using the probability sampling technique. Questionnaires were distributed to collect data on general health information, as well as knowledge and preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19. (3) Results: more than half (55.9%) of the participants were female and had not received the COVID-19 vaccine (67.2%). Their mean age was 44.13 years. The majority had moderate COVID-19 knowledge and engaged in preventive behaviors (65.5% and 42.0%, respectively). A linear regression model showed that the COVID-19 knowledge score was related to the COVID-19 preventive behaviors score, with a standardized coefficient of 0.510, after adjusting for age, underlying disease, and body mass index (B = 2.64; 95%CI = 2.42, 2.87). Binary logistic regression revealed that after controlling for age, education, occupation, financial status, and current disease (AOR = 1.87; 95%CI = 1.64C2.13), the score of COVID-19 knowledge was significantly associated with having the COVID-19 vaccine. (4) Discussion: knowledge of COVID-19 is very important for people in rural regions to engage in COVID-19 prevention behaviors and vaccination. Relevant government agencies and health network partners should support proactive education campaigns emphasizing the risk of contracting the disease and its severity in order to promote vaccination against COVID-19 among unvaccinated groups.

OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility and potential utility of high-resolution angioscopy with an SFE during common endovascular neurosurgical procedures. METHODS A 3.7-French SFE was used in a porcine model system to image endothelial disruption, ischemic stroke and mechanical thrombectomy, aneurysm coiling, and flow-diverting stent placement. RESULTS High-resolution, video-rate imaging was shown to be possible during all of the common procedures tested and provided information that was complementary to standard fluoroscopic imaging. SFE angioscopy was able to assess novel factors such as aneurysm base coverage fraction and side branch patency, which have previously not been possible to determine with conventional angiography. CONCLUSION Endovascular imaging with an SFE provides important information on factors that cannot be assessed fluoroscopically and is a novel platform on which future neurointerventional techniques may be based because it allows for periprocedural inspection of the integrity of the vascular system and the deployed devices.

Timely recovery of liver volume is a key factor for improving prognosis and post-operative mortality of patients undergone liver resection. The aim of the present study was to compare liver regeneration after laparoscopic over open partial hepatectomy. METHODS Wistar rats were subjected to laparoscopic 70% hepatectomy (group LAP-HEP), open 70% hepatectomy (group HEP), sham operation (group Sham) or no intervention (group Control). At various timepoints following operation (1 h-2 weeks), the liver was excised to assess relative liver weight, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, mitotic activity, tissue expression of Nuclear Factor-B (NFB), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the histopathologic profile. RESULTS No differences were seen in relative liver weight between hepatectomy groups. Mitotic index was increased in all operative study groups, being higher in group LAP-HEP than in group HEP. TBARS levels were higher in group LAP-HEP compared to group HEP. NFB and VCAM-1 tissue expression scores were increased in all operative study groups with VCAM-1 being higher in group HEP, while ICAM-1 was overexpressed only in hepatectomy groups. Mild histopathologic lesions were noted in hepatectomy groups with the histopathologic score being higher in group HEP (24 h).

However, these data often lack laboratory results, the standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: We assessed the validity of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for identifying patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in U.S. claims databases, compared to linked laboratory results, among six Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System data partners (two large national insurers, four integrated delivery systems) from February 20-October 17, 2020. We identified patients hospitalized with COVID-19 according to five ICD-10-CM diagnosis code-based algorithms, which included combinations of codes U07.1, B97.29, general coronavirus codes, and diagnosis codes for severe symptoms. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm relative to laboratory test results. We stratified results by data source type and across three time periods: February 20-March 31 (Time A), April 1-30 (Time B), May 1-October 17 (Time C). RESULTS: The five algorithms identified between 34 806 and 47 293 patients across the study periods; 23% with known laboratory results contributed to PPV calculations. PPVs were high and similar across algorithms. PPV of U07.1 alone was stable around 93% for integrated delivery systems, but declined over time from 93% to 70% among national insurers. Overall PPV of U07.1 across all data partners was 94.1% (95% CI, 92.3%-95.5%) in Time A and 81.2% (95% CI, 80.1%-82.2%) in Time C.

METHODS: Qualitative, audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews were conducted from eight women who were members of a private Facebook group'. Data were analysed using theoretical thematic analysis, and SCT was used as a theoretical lens through which the data were interrogated. RESULTS: A number of themes were identified from the women's experiences, with analysis uncovering the superordinate theme 'increased self-efficacy' which provided an understanding of how the group impacted women's experiences and aided them in breastfeeding success. The sub-themes of education, accessibility, online community, normalization, and extended goals provided a more detailed understanding of how self-efficacy was increased through group membership. CONCLUSION: The symbiotic relationship between members of a social media group facilitates greater breastfeeding success and a longer duration of breastfeeding through the central concept of the SCT: reciprocal determinism. Therefore, it is posited that the SCT is a suitable theory of behaviour change which can potentially be used to develop interventions aiming to increase breastfeeding rates and duration.","output":"Women's experience of social media breastfeeding support and its impact on extended breastfeeding success: A social cognitive perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In recent years, research on online learning platforms has exploded in quantity. More and more researchers are using these platforms to conduct A/B tests on the impact of different designs, and multiple scientific communities have emerged around studying the big data becoming available from these platforms. However, it is not yet fully understood how each type of research influences future scientific discourse within the broader field. To address this gap, this paper presents the first scientometric study on how researchers build on the contributions of these two types of online learning platform research (particularly in STEM education). We selected a pair of papers (one using A/B testing, the other conducting learning analytics (LA), on platform data of an online STEM education platform), published in the same year, by the same research group, at the same conference. We then analyzed each of the papers that cited these two papers, coding from the paper text (with inter-rater reliability checks) the reason for each citation made. RESULTS: After statistically comparing the frequency of each category of citation between papers, we found that the A/B test paper was self-cited more and that citing papers built on its work directly more frequently, whereas the LA paper was more often cited without discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the A/B test paper appeared to have had a larger impact on future work than the learning analytics (LA) paper, even though the LA paper had a higher count of total citations with a lower degree of self-citation.

DSPs are chimeras of an enzymatic split, Renilla luciferase (RL), and a non-enzymatic split green fluorescent protein (GFP). Nanoparticles expressing DSPs, sialic acid, and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were generated, and RL activity was determined in the presence of HPAI or LPAI pseudotyped viruses. The RL activity of nanoparticles containing both DSPs was approximately 2  10(6) RLU, indicating that DSPs can be successfully incorporated into nanoparticles. The RL activity of nanoparticles containing half of the DSPs was around 5  10(1) RLU. When nanoparticles containing half of the DSPs were incubated with HPAI pseudotyped viruses at low pH, RL activity was increased up to 1  10(3) RLU. However, LPAI pseudotyped viruses produced RL activity only in the presence of proteases (trypsin or TMPRSS2), and the average RL activity was around 7  10(2) RLU.

Another major enzyme encoded by many viruses is a protease responsible for the processing of virus-encoded polyproteins. The HIV protease has been very successfully targeted, and hepatitis C virus and rhinovirus protease inhibitors are being actively developed. The complex series of interactions during virus entry is a rapidly emerging and promising target for inhibitors of HIV and many other viruses.

Clinical researchers will get a random sequence number which is automatically generated by a random number generator (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and sequentially number them in an opaque envelope. Researchers will open random allocation envelopes and assign participants accordingly. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into a routine supportive care group and a routine supportive care plus oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine group, with 70 patients in each group. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study. The statistical analysis will be carried out by the Professor of Statistics at Wenzhou Medical University, who is blinded to patient allocation.

In this study, we established a sepsis model using naturally aged rats and injected 510(6) umbilical cord-derived MSCs via the tail vein. Each group of rats was analyzed for survival, examined for biochemical parameters, stained for organ histology, and analyzed for the Th cell subpopulation ratio and inflammatory cytokine levels by flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed to detect the activity of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We designed the vitro experiments to confirm the regulatory role of MSCs, and verified the possible mechanism using JAK/STAT inhibitors. It was revealed from the experiments that the 72 h survival rate of sepsis rats treated with MSCs was significantly increased, organ damage and inflammatory infiltration were reduced, the levels of organ damage indicators were decreased, the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg in peripheral blood and spleen were significantly decreased, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 were decreased, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 were increased, and the levels of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation were reduced. These results were validated in in vitro experiments. Therefore, this study confirms that MSCs can control the inflammatory response induced by sepsis by regulating Th cells and inflammatory factors, and that this leads to the reduction of tissue damage, protection of organ functions and ultimately the improvement of survival in aged sepsis model rats. Inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was surmised that it may be an important mechanism for their action.","output":"The Study on the Regulation of Th Cells by Mesenchymal Stem Cells Through the JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway to Protect Naturally Aged Sepsis Model Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification catalyzed by host RNA methyltransferases. As obligate intracellular parasites, many viruses acquire m6A methylation in their RNAs. However, the biological functions of viral m6A methylation are poorly understood. Here, we found that viral m6A methylation serves as a molecular marker for host innate immunity to discriminate self from nonself RNA and that this novel biological function of viral m6A methylation is universally conserved in several families in non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses. Using m6A methyltransferase (METTL3)-knockout cells, we produced m6A-deficient virion RNA from the representative members of the families Pneumoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae and found that these m6A-deficient viral RNAs triggered significantly higher levels of type I interferon compared to the m6A-sufficient viral RNAs, in a RIG-I dependent manner. Reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway revealed that m6A-deficient virion RNA induced higher expression of RIG-I, bound to RIG-I more efficiently, enhanced RIG-I ubiquitination, and facilitated RIG-I conformational rearrangement and oligomerization. Furthermore, the m6A binding protein YTHDF2 is essential for suppression of type I interferon signaling pathway included by virion RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that several families in NNS RNA viruses acquire m6A in viral RNA as a common strategy to evade host innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses share many common replication and gene expression strategies. There is no vaccine or antiviral drugs for many of these viruses. We found that representative members in the families of Pneumoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae in NNS RNA viruses acquire m6A methylation in their genome and antigenome as a means to escape the recognition by host innate immunity via a RIG-I dependent signaling pathway. Viral RNA lacking m6A methylation induces a significantly higher type I interferon compared to m6A sufficient viral RNA. In addition to uncovering m6A methylation as a common mechanism for many NNS RNA viruses to evade host innate immunity, this study discovered a novel strategy to enhance type I interferon responses, which may have important applications in vaccine development, as a robust innate immunity will likely promote the subsequent adaptive immunity.","output":"Non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses utilize N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) as a common strategy to evade host innate immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Characterization of the risk factors associated with variability in the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 is important. Our previous study using genomic data identified a potential role of calcium and lipid homeostasis in severe COVID-19. This study aimed to identify similar combinations of features (disease signatures) associated with severe disease in a separate patient population with purely clinical and phenotypic data. The PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform was used to analyze features derived from de-identified health records in the UnitedHealth Group COVID-19 Data Suite. The platform identified and analyzed 836 disease signatures in two cohorts associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Cohort 1 was formed of cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and a set of controls who developed mild symptoms. Cohort 2 included Cohort 1 individuals for whom additional laboratory test data was available. We found several disease signatures where lower levels of lipids were found co-occurring with lower levels of serum calcium and leukocytes. Many of the low lipid signatures were independent of statin use and 50% of cases with hypocalcemia signatures were reported with vitamin D deficiency. These signatures may be attributed to similar mechanisms linking calcium and lipid signaling where changes in cellular lipid levels during inflammation and infection affect calcium signaling in host cells. This study and our previous genomics analysis demonstrate that combinatorial analysis can identify disease signatures associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 separately from genomic or clinical data in different populations.

Internal control personality has a negative moderating effect between parental trust, parental communication, and adversarial growth and a positive moderating effect between parental alienation and adversarial growth. Low internal control personality therefore has a positive influence on parental trust and communication on adversarial growth and decreases the negative influence of parental alienation.

METHODS: We analysed 2,741 subjects (mean age 58.115.3 y) pooled from 2 retrospective Italian cohorts recruited from May to September 2020: 1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1,401 adults, a portion of the larger Moli-sani Study (n = 24,325) who were administered a telephone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement; 2) the ALT RISCOVID-19 is a web-based survey of 1,340 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire by using Google? forms. Psychological distress was measured by assessments of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-4), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Diet quality was assessed either as changes in consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) or adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD). RESULTS: In a multivariable regression analysis controlled for major sociodemographic factors, depression (=-0.06, 95%CI -0.10, -0.01), anxiety (=-0.05, -0.09, -0.004) and PTSD (=-0.04, -0.08, -0.002) were inversely associated with MD and directly with UPF ( = 0.13, 0.09, 0.18;  = 0.12, 0.08, 0.16 and  = 0.10, 0.06, 0.13, respectively); stress was associated with UPF ( = 0.06, 0.02, 0.10) but not with MD (=-0.03, -0.08, 0.01).

The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type.

Patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, who received a protocolized CPT session and for which a pre-and post-RPT lung ultrasound (LUS) was performed, were included. A subgroup of patients had an available quantitative computed tomography (CT) scan performed within 4 days from RPT. The primary aim was to evaluate whether RPT improved oxygenation;secondary aims included correlations between LUS, CT and response to RPT. Results: Twenty patients were included.

What is frequently overlooked is the fact that, in light of a wealth of evidence as well as other management options, a therapy deemed suitable yesterday may no longer be the first choice today. Use of blood has not been based upon scientific evaluation of benefits, but mostly on anecdotal experience and a variety of factors are challenging current practice. Blood is a precious resource with an ever limiting supply due to the aging population. Costs have also continually increased due to advances (and complexities) in collection, testing, processing and administration of transfusion, which could make up 5% of the total health service budget. Risks of transfusions remain a major concern, with advances in blood screening and processing shifting the profile from infectious to non\\\\infectious risks. Most worrying though, is the accumulating literature demonstrating a strong (often dose\\\\dependent) association between transfusion and adverse outcomes. These include increased length of stay, postoperative infection, morbidity and mortality. To this end, a recent international consensus conference on transfusion outcomes (ICCTO) concluded that there was little evidence to corroborate that blood would improve patients outcomes in the vast majority of clinical scenarios in which transfusions are currently routinely considered; more appropriate clinical management options should be adopted and transfusion avoided wherever possible. On the other hand, there are patients for whom the perceived benefits of transfusion are likely to outweigh the potential risks. Consensus guidelines for blood component therapy have been developed to assist clinicians in identifying these patients and most of these guidelines have long advocated more conservative triggers for transfusion. However, significant variation in practice and inappropriate transfusions are still prevalent. The blood must always be good philosophy continues to permeate clinical practice. An alternative approach, however, is being adopted in an increasing number of centres. Experience in managing Jehovahs Witness patients has shown that complex care without transfusion is possible and results are comparable with, if not better than those of transfused patients. These experiences and rising awareness of downsides of transfusion helped create what has become known as patient blood management. Principles of this approach include optimizing erythropoiesis, reducing surgical blood loss and harnessing the patients physiological tolerance of anaemia. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, using a multidisciplinary team approach and employing a combination of modalities. Results have demonstrated reduction of transfusion, improved patient outcomes and patient satisfaction. Significant healthcare cost savings have also followed. Despite the success of patient blood management programmes and calls for practice change, the potential and actual harm to patients caused through inappropriate transfusion is still not sufficiently tangible for the public and many clinicians.

The format of the present article has features of a systematic case-based review (level of evidence), and it is structured as a case series report (patients of our COVID-19 Medicine Ward have been selected as cases). Data for this review have been selected systematically, taking evidence only from indexed journals and databases: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Cochrane systems. Papers chosen included systematic reviews, case series, clinical cases, meta-analysis studies, and RCTs. We start collecting studies since 2003. The main keywords used were COVID-19 OR SARS OR SARS C COV 2 AND systemic disease / nephropathy / cardiac pathology / central nervous system. Clinical cases belong to our COVID-19 Medicine Ward. One of the most severe COVID-19 clinical presentations includes cardiovascular problems, like myocarditis, pericarditis, and acute hearth failure. Cytokine release syndrome caused by COVID-19 develops severe acute kidney failure. It is still unknown the way coronavirus damages the liver, brain, and reproductive system. Considering the majority of the new studies about this pathology, it issues that COVID-19 is considered to be a multi-organ disease.","output":"COVID-19: is it just a lung disease?

In the current study, we carried out yeast two-hybrid assays to screen human proteins that could interact with 3A protein of EV71. Human 3 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (ATP1B3) protein was demonstrated to interact with the 3A protein of EV71. Although 3A protein had no effect on the expression of ATP1B3, EV71 infection resulted in elevated expression of ATP1B3 in RD cell line, both on messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Interestingly, knockdown of ATP1B3 could significantly increase the replication of EV71, whereas overexpression of ATP1B3 significantly suppressed the replication of EV71 in RD cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of ATP1B3 could induce the production of type-I interferons. Our study demonstrated that ATP1B3 inhibit EV71 replication by enhancing the production of type-I interferons, which could act as a potential therapeutic target in EV71 infection.","output":"ATP1B3: a virus-induced host factor against EV71 replication by up-regulating the production of type-I interferons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To synthesize evidence for prefrontal cortex (PFC), quadriceps, and respiratory muscle oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cycling in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A scoping review was performed searching databases (inception-August 2020): Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Pedro. The search focused on COPD, cycling, and NIRS outcomes. 29 studies (541 COPD participants) were included. Compared to healthy individuals (8 studies), COPD patients at lower cycling workloads had more rapid increases in vastus lateralis (VL) deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb); lower increases in VL total hemoglobin (tHb) and blood flow; and lower muscle tissue saturation (StO2). Heliox and bronchodilators were associated with smaller and slower increases in VL HHb. Heliox increased VL and intercostal blood flow compared to room air and supplemental oxygen in COPD patients (1 study). PFC oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) increased in COPD individuals during cycling in 5 of 8 studies. Individuals with COPD and heart failure demonstrated worse VL and PFC NIRS outcomes compared to patients with only COPD-higher or more rapid increase in VL HHb and no change or decrease in PFC O2Hb. Individuals with COPD present with a mismatch between muscle oxygen delivery and utilization, characterized by more rapid increase in VL HHb, lower muscle O2Hb and lower muscle StO2. PFC O2Hb increases or tends to increase in individuals with COPD during exercise, but this relationship warrants further investigation. NIRS can be used to identify key deoxygenation thresholds during exercise to inform PFC and muscle oxygenation.","output":"Muscle and cerebral oxygenation during cycling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper features an analysis of former President Trumps early tweets on COVID-19 in the context of Dr. Faucis recently revealed email trove.

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify (1) how human factors affect ward care escalation (2) gaps in the current literature and (3) critique literature methodologies. METHODS We undertook a Qualitative Evidence Synthesis of care escalation studies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINHAL from inception to September 2019. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment-Development and Evaluation and Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research tool to assess study quality. RESULTS Our search identified 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Confidence in findings was moderate (20 studies) to high (4 studies). In 16 studies, the ability to recognise changes in the patient's condition (soft signals), including skin colour/temperature, respiratory pattern, blood loss, personality change, patient complaint and fatigue, improved the ability to escalate patients. Soft signals were detected through patient assessment (looking/listening/feeling) and not Early Warning Scores (eight studies). In contrast, 13 studies found a high workload and low staffing levels reduced staff's ability to detect patient deterioration and escalate care. In eight studies quantifiable deterioration evidence (Early Warning Scores) facilitated escalation communication, particularly when referrer/referee were unfamiliar. Conversely, escalating concerning non-triggering patients was challenging but achieved by some clinical staff (three studies). Team decision making facilitated the clinical escalation (six studies). CONCLUSIONS Early Warning Scores have clinical benefits but can sometimes impede escalation in patients not meeting the threshold. Staff use other factors (soft signals) not captured in Early Warning Scores to escalate care. The literature supports strategies that improve the escalation process such as good patient assessment skills.

METHODS: The Data stems from geocoded locations of violent crimes combined with data on the density of on-premises alcohol outlets and the level of COVID-19 restrictions in Copenhagen, Denmark. We use a negative binomial count model with cluster robust standard error to assess the effect of the interaction between alcohol outlet density and COVID-related restriction levels on the nightlife economy on the frequency of violent crime. RESULTS: The article reveals how both the level of restrictions on the nightlife economy and the density of alcohol outlets significantly impacted the frequency of violent crime. The regression analysis shows that the effect of restrictions on the nightlife economy depends on the concentration of on-premises alcohol outlets in the area. In areas with a high concentration of outlets, we observe a much higher reduction in crime as consequence of the COVID-19 related restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The results shows that a more restricted nightlife economy, including earlier closing times, could have a crime preventive effect, especially in areas with a high density of alcohol outlets.","output":"Nightlife activity and crime: The impact of COVID-19 related nightlife restrictions on violent crime"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted training in obstetrics and gynaecology.

Adequate vascularization has been recognized as a crucial factor for successful bone regeneration, as newly formed microvessels guarantee the supply of the callus tissue with vital oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors. Accordingly, a vast number of preclinical studies have focused on the development of vascularization strategies to stimulate fracture repair. However, recent evidence suggests that stimulation of blood vessel formation is an oversimplified approach to support bone regeneration. This review discusses the role of vascularization during bone regeneration and delineates a phenomenon, for which we coin the term \\"the vascularization paradox of non-union-formation\\". This view is based on the results of a variety of experimental studies that suggest that the callus tissue of non-unions is indeed densely vascularized and that pro-angiogenic mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, are sufficiently expressed at the facture site. By gaining further insights into the molecular and cellular basis of non-union vascularization, it may be possible to develop more optimized treatment approaches or even prevent the non-union formation in the future.","output":"The vascularization paradox of non-union formation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equitable health benefit design is central to addressing the health inequities of individuals with commercial health insurance in the United States.

Whether stent polymers behave differently under such conditions has never been explored. METHODS: Fluorinated polymer-nanocoated and uncoated COBRA stents (CeloNova), BioLinx-polymer-coated Resolute Onyx stents (Medtronic), and Synergy stents (Boston Scientific), which are abluminally coated with a bioabsorbable polymer, were exposed to human blood from healthy donors which was supplemented with 400 pg/mL IL-6 and 100 pg/mL TNF-&#945;, similar to what is seen in cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2. Platelet adhesion and neutrophil activation, assessed by immunofluorescence, were compared under cytokine storm and control conditions (untreated blood) (n = 4 experimental runs). RESULTS: Platelet adhesion values, defined as %platelet-covered area x staining intensity, were significantly lower in coated and uncoated COBRA and in Resolute Onyx than in Synergy under control conditions (1.28  107  0.43  107 vs. 2.92  107  0.49  107 vs. 3.57  107  0.73  107 vs. 9.94  107  0.99  107; p &#8804;0.0001). In cytokine storm, platelet adhesion values remained low in coated COBRA-PzF (1.78  107  0.38  107) compared to all other devices (uncoated COBRA: 5.92  107  0.96  107; Resolute Onyx: 7.27  107  1.82  107; Synergy: 11.28  107  1.08  107; p &#8804; 0.0001). Although cytokine storm conditions significantly increased neutrophil activation in all stents, it was significantly less in coated and uncoated COBRA, and in Resolute Onyx than in Synergy.

Hence, it is necessary to rapidly find the drug-candidates that can be used to treat the infection. Since the main protease (Mpro) is the key protein in the virus's life cycle, Mpro is served as one of the critical targets of antiviral treatment. We employed virtual screening tools to search for new inhibitors to accelerate the drug discovery process. The hit compounds were subsequently docked into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and ranked by their binding energy. Furthermore, in-silico ADME studies were performed to probe for adoption with the standard ranges. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the protein-drug complex's fluctuation over time in an aqueous medium. This study indicates that the interaction energy of the top ten retrieved compounds with COVID-19 main protease is much higher than the interaction energy of some currently in use protease drugs such as ML188, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, and &#945;-ketoamide. Among the discovered compounds, Pubchem44326934 showed druglike properties and was further analyzed by MD and MM/PBSA approaches. Besides, the constant binding free energy over MD trajectories suggests a probable drug possessing antiviral properties.

In the present study, a previously undescribed neurovascular disorder associated with a PCV2 infection is described. Sixteen pigs showed clinical signs of wasting and neurologic deficits. Acute hemorrhages and edema of cerebellar meninges and parenchyma due to a necrotizing vasculitis resulted in degeneration and necrosis of the gray and white matter. Few to numerous PCV2 DNA and antigen-bearing endothelial cells were detected in affected areas of the brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Conventional histochemical stains, as well as the detection of caspase 3 activity and DNA strand breaks by the terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, showed numerous apoptotic endothelial cells in the vascular lesions observed. Sequencing of various brain-derived PCV2-specific amplicons revealed a strong identity between different isolates and an 89 to 100% identity to previous isolates. The phylogenetic tree showed that there was no clustering of isolates correlating to clinical signs or geographic distribution. This previously undescribed PCV2-associated neurologic disease has features of both postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and, to a lesser extent, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome.

As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one\\\\off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse\\\\textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse\\\\textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non\\\\clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order to protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource-intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. METHODS: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. RESULTS: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78% to 86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96% to 100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%).

Amidst the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, however, this technique has been increasingly utilized in settings outside of the ICU, particularly in the emergency department. With emerging evidence that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who are not intubated and mechanically ventilated may benefit from the prone position, this strategy should not be isolated to only those with critical illness. This is a review of the pertinent physiology and evidence supporting prone positioning along with a step-by-step guide meant to familiarize those who are not already comfortable with the maneuver. Placing a patient in the prone position helps to improve ventilation-perfusion matching, dorsal lung recruitment, and ultimately gas exchange. Evidence also suggests there is improved oxygenation in both mechanically ventilated patients and those who are awake and spontaneously breathing, further reinforcing the utility of the prone position in non-ICU settings. Given present concerns about resource limitations because of the pandemic, prone positioning has especially demonstrable value as a technique to delay or even prevent intubation. Patients who are able to self-prone should be directed into the ''swimmer's position'' and then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position if further oxygenation is needed.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging.

However, the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection that led to death were linked to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm syndrome. This article reported the various checkpoints targeted to manage the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. The literature search was carried out using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Journal articles that discussed SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine storm were retrieved and appraised. Specific checkpoints identified in managing SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm include a decrease in the level of Nod-Like Receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome where drugs such as quercetin and anakinra were effective. Janus kinase-2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (JAK2/STAT1) signaling pathways were blocked by medicines such as tocilizumab, baricitinib, and quercetin. In addition, inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6 with dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and sarilumab effectively treats cytokine storm and significantly reduces mortality caused by COVID-19. Blockade of IL-1 with drugs such as canakinumab and anakinra, and inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with zanubrutinib and ibrutinib was also beneficial. These agents' overall mechanisms of action involve a decrease in circulating proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines and or blockade of their receptors. Consequently, the actions of these drugs significantly improve respiration and raise lymphocyte count and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio.

For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare to support physicians in the diagnostic process. METHODS: We propose a novel CAD system that processes histological images and discriminates between sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. To this goal, we designed, tested, and compared two artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers. The former implements a shallow ANN classifying hand-crafted features extracted from Regions of Interest (ROIs) by means of image-processing procedures. The latter, instead, employs the IBM Watson Visual Recognition System, which uses a deep artificial neural network making decisions taking the images as input, without the need to design any procedure for describing images with features. The input dataset consisted of 428 sclerotic glomeruli and 2344 non-sclerotic glomeruli derived from images of kidney biopsies scanned by the Aperio ScanScope System. RESULTS: Both AI approaches allowed to very accurately distinguish (mean MCC 0.95 and mean Accuracy 0.99) between sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli. Although the systems may seem interchangeable, the approach based on feature extraction and classification would allow clinicians to gain information on the most discriminating features. In fact, further procedures could explain the classifiers decision by analysing which subset of features impacted the most on the final decision. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a customizable support system that can facilitate the work of renal pathologists both in clinical and research settings.

Viral nuclear import antagonists, expressed by several highly pathogenic RNA viruses, likely mediate pleiotropic effects on host gene expression, presumably interfering with transcription factors, cytokines, hormones, and/or signaling cascades that occur in response to infection. By bioinformatic and systems biology approaches, we evaluated the impact of nuclear import antagonism on host expression networks by using human lung epithelial cells infected with either wild-type virus or a mutant that does not express ORF6 protein. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in differential gene expression, with approximately twice as many upregulated genes in the mutant virus samples by 48 h postinfection, despite identical viral titers. Our data demonstrated that ORF6 protein expression attenuates the activity of numerous karyopherin-dependent host transcription factors (VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4) that are critical for establishing antiviral responses and regulating key host responses during virus infection. Results were confirmed by proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses and in parallel microarray studies using infected primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. The data strongly support the hypothesis that viral antagonists of nuclear import actively manipulate host responses in specific hierarchical patterns, contributing to the viral pathogenic potential in vivo. Importantly, these studies and modeling approaches not only provide templates for evaluating virus antagonism of nuclear import processes but also can reveal candidate cellular genes and pathways that may significantly influence disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in vivo.","output":"Release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nuclear import block enhances host transcription in human lung cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The obesity-hypoventilation syndrome associated with COVID-19 rapidly leads to severe acute respiratory failure with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, becoming a therapeutic challenge for intensive care personnel due to the absence of ventilatory strategies.

It is clear that when traveling, tourists often choose places where animals are present. They look for places with wild animals more often. Our article introduces issues concerning the role of farm animals in the creation of agritourism products and the prospects of using animals in agritourism. On the one hand, farm animals are an additional source for people who run agritourism farms and make the stay of tourists in rural areas more attractive. The presence of livestock acts as a magnet, attracting more tourists to these farms and achieving higher returns on agritourism activities. However, among the reasons for the lack of contact with animals in agritourism offerings, farmers indicated: the lack of financial resources and the lack of conditions to provide the animals with adequate maintenance. It is worth introducing farm animals as a tourist attraction in agritourism offerings. ABSTRACT: Animals are an integral part of human life. Currently, they constitute a relevant factor contributing to the tourist experiences of individuals travelling for tourist purposes. Domestic (farm) animals constitute a tourist attraction, are a source of income for individuals running agritourism farms, and render the tourists stay in rural areas more attractive. It is important to maintain the welfare of livestock based on principles of sustainability. The authors conducted research among agritourism providers in Wielkopolska Voivodeship. The aim of the survey was to determine whether agritourism farms keep livestock, what species they are, and whether they are important in building an agritourism product and what the prospects are for using animals in agritourism. A questionnaire was used for the study. The use of a variety of animal species facilitates the maintenance of biodiversity on the farm. Our research shows that 57.3% of the analysed agritourism providers included animals. Additionally, we discovered that the presence of livestock acts as a magnet that draws more tourists towards the individuals running agritourism farms and thus causes them to obtain higher profit from the agritourism business. According to the surveyed individuals, the most influential reason for the absence of livestock on their farms was the lack of financial resources and conditions to provide the animals with proper maintenance. Such findings may prompt the introduction of livestock as a tourist attraction in agritourism in other regions.","output":"Can Animals Be the Key to the Development of Tourism: A Case Study of Livestock in Agritourism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Despite the well-documented negative effects of posttraumatic stress symptoms following childbirth (PTSS-FC), research on protective factors for PTSS-FC is still missing. Aiming to fill this gap, we proposed and examined a process model through which maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact after birth reduces PTSS-FC by decreasing negative emotions, especially for women who had operative births. METHOD: In this longitudinal study, pregnant women (N = 1833) were recruited at community and hospital medical centres in the center of Israel and through internet forums. At Time 1, during pregnancy, they rated their prenatal depressive symptoms which served as an indicator for prenatal vulnerabilities. At Time 2, two-months postpartum (N = 1371, 75% of the sample), they reported their mode of birth, whether they had skin-to-skin contact with their newborn after birth, their emotions during birth, and rated their current PTSS-FC. A moderated mediation analysis was used to examine the proposed model. RESULTS: Guilt and fear during birth mediated the association between mode of birth (instrumental or cesarean versus vaginal) and PTSS-FC. Skin-to-skin contact was related to reduced feelings of guilt and fear during birth, especially for women who had a cesarean section. CONCLUSIONS: Our results recognize the specific emotions that contribute to the development of PTSS-FC following operative births and show how skin-to-skin contact can possibly reduce them.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed the vitamin D levels of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Razi Hospital (an infectious disease referral center in Mazandaran province in northern Iran) from February to March 2020. Overall, a cutoff point of 30 ng/mL was used for the definition of vitamin D sufficiency. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients were analyzed in this study who had laboratory documentation of a 25(OH) D level at the time of hospitalization. The vitamin D levels of the patients were 27.19  20.17 ng/mL. In total, 62.7% (n = 96) of the patients had a 25(OH) D level of less than 30 ng/mL and 37.25% (n = 57) had a 25(OH) D level of more than 30 ng/mL. In total, 49% (n = 75) of the patients suffered from at least one underlying disease. The univariate and multivariable regression showed that vitamin D sufficiency was not associated with a statistically significant lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 such as duration of hospitalization and severity of infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient vitamin D levels were not found to be protective against adverse clinical outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19.

Up to now, there have been no knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) studies carried out on DF in Nepal that have included qualitative in-depth and quantitative data. Thus, we aimed to explore and compare the KAP of people residing in the lowland (< 1500 m) and highland (> 1500 m) areas of Nepal. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted in six districts of central Nepal in SeptemberCOctober 2018 including both quantitative (660 household surveys) and qualitative data (12 focus group discussions and 27 in-depth interviews). The KAP assessment was executed using a scoring system and defined as high or low based on 80% cut-off point. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associated factors, in quantitative analysis. The deductive followed by inductive approach was adopted to identify the themes in the qualitative data. RESULTS: The study revealed that both the awareness about DF and prevention measures were low. Among the surveyed participants, 40.6% had previously heard about DF with a significantly higher number in the lowland areas. Similarly, IDI and FGD participants from the lowland areas were aware about DF, and its associated symptoms, hence they were adopting better preventive practices against DF. The findings of both the qualitative and quantitative data indicate that people residing in the lowland areas had better knowledge on DF compared to people in highland areas. All IDI participants perceived a higher chance of increasing future dengue outbreaks due to increasing temperature and the mobility of infected people from endemic to non-endemic areas. The most quoted sources of information were the television (71.8%) and radio (51.5%). Overall, only 2.3% of the HHS participants obtained high knowledge scores, 74.1% obtained high attitude scores and 21.2% obtained high preventive practice scores on DF. Among the socio-demographic variables, the area of residence, educational level, age, monthly income, SES and occupation were independent predictors of knowledge level, while the education level of the participants was an independent predictor of the attitude level. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found a very low level of knowledge and insufficient preventive practices.

However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality ( = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness ( = ?6.57, 95% CI: ?12.78, ?0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p < 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions ( = ?0.12, 95% CI: ?0.22, ?0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well. (c) The COVID-19 outbreak has reduced peoples aggressiveness, probably by making people realize the fragility and preciousness of life.","output":"Mental Health Problems during the COVID-19 Pandemics and the Mitigation Effects of Exercise: A Longitudinal Study of College Students in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose or Objective: Health history questionnaires have been shown to be an accurate and reliable means of collecting clinical information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a self-administered health history questionnaire in our radiation oncology department to improve the efficiency of new patient consultations. Materials and Methods: A health history questionnaire was developed and posted to patients prior to their initial new patient clinic appointment. They were requested to fill it in and bring it with them to their appointment. Sections included demographic details, past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies, family and social history, previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy details and performance status. We conducted a paper survey of the first 44 patients to enquire about their experience. Results: All 44 patients participated in the study and completed the questionnaire prior to attending clinic. Median time to complete the questionnaire was 5-15 minutes. The majority of patients (75%;33/44) found the questionnaire easy or very easy to complete. The questionnaire received positive feedback with 66% (29/44) of patients finding it helpful or very helpful. Suggestions for improvement included the establishment of a common patient record between General Practice and the hospital system. Comments included that the questionnaire allowed patients time to check background details they were unsure about prior to attending their appointment. Conclusion: Both patients and healthcare providers found the health history questionnaire to be a helpful, easy to use tool.

The virus is zoonotic and tends to be transmitted between animals to humans and humans to humans. The major route of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 is droplet and close contact. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health has initiated training for health care workers at a different level. Thus, the main objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health workers in Ethiopia toward coronavirus disease 2019 and its prevention techniques. METHOD: An institution-based multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in each of eight teaching and referral hospitals. A total of 422 Ethiopian healthcare workers were selected for the assessment of knowledge, attitude, and practice toward coronavirus disease 2019. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the attitude and knowledge of healthcare workers toward coronavirus disease 2019 at a significance level of p < 0.05. RESULT: Three hundred ninety-seven healthcare workers participated in the study, with a response rate of 94%. Among these, 88.2% and 94.7% of respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes, respectively.

The vaccine BCG has been used as a vector to express recombinant proteins and has been shown to protect against several diseases, particularly respiratory viruses. Methods: BCG was used to develop recombinant vaccines expressing either the Nucleoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 or Andes orthohantavirus. Mice were immunized with these vaccines with the aim of evaluating the safety and immunogenicity parameters. Results: Immunization with two doses of 1  10(8) CFU or one dose of 1  10(5) CFU of these BCGs was safe in mice. A statistically significant cellular immune response was induced by both formulations, characterized as the activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Stimulation with unrelated antigens resulted in increased expression of activation markers by T cells and secretion of IL-2 and IFN-, while increased secretion of IL-6 was found for both recombinant vaccines; all of these parameters related to a trained immunity profile. The humoral immune response elicited by both vaccines was modest, but further exposure to antigens could increase this response. Conclusions: The BCG vaccine is a promising platform for developing vaccines against different pathogens, inducing a marked antigen-specific immune response.","output":"BCG-Based Vaccines Elicit Antigen-Specific Adaptive and Trained Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and Andes orthohantavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weight gain attempts are common among adolescents, yet a paucity of research has explored these behaviors among adults, particularly in relation to substance use behaviors. To address this gap in the literature, pooled data from the 2018 and 2019 International Food Policy Study (N = 42,108) were analyzed. The association of weight gain attempts in the past 12 months with four important and relatively common substance use behaviors (alcohol use, binge-drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use) was examined using multiple modified Poisson regression analyses that adjusted for theoretically relevant covariates. Among men and women, weight gain attempts were associated with a higher likelihood of cigarette smoking in the past 30 days, marijuana use in the past 12 months, and binge-drinking one or more times per month in the past 12 months among men only. Among women, weight gain attempts were associated with a lower likelihood of alcohol use one or more times per month in the past 12 months.

METHODS: All consecutive patients aged over 16 who underwent aortic valve repair with external ring annuloplasty for isolated aortic insufficiency, aortic insufficiency and tubular aortic aneurysm or aortic root aneurysm between May 2003 and November 2019 were included in a cohort study. Data were collected and analysed from the AVIATOR registry (AorticValve repair InternATiOnal Registry). Propensity score framework analysis (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to compare outcomes of the groups while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: During the 16-year study period, 618 patients underwent aortic valve repair. Eight-year survival rate was 92% in the patch group and 90.2% in the no patch group without significant differences [P = 0.957 inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) weighted]. Early valve-related reoperation was more frequent in the patch group as compared to the no patch group (6% vs 1%, P < 0.001 IPTW weighted), the freedom from aortic valve-related reintervention and from structural valve deterioration at 8 years was not significantly different between the patch and no patch groups (93.7% vs 94%, P = 0.968 IPTW weighted; and 99.3% vs 96.7%, P = 0.964 IPTW weighted). CONCLUSIONS: Although a higher rate of early reintervention was observed, aortic valve repair using the pericardial patch, in a standardized approach using external annuloplasty, with effective coaptation height of at least 9 mm, was not associated with an increase in mid-term aortic valve-related reoperation or structural valve deterioration as compared to valve repair without the pericardial patch.","output":"Aortic valve repair using pericardial patch standardized with external ring annuloplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the pandemic impact on electric vehicle (EV) monitoring framework designed for analysing and tracking of EV charging data in the Croatian electric vehicle charging station grid. The developed framework encompasses multiple features of the EV charging grid behaviour, notably: (i) global predictions of the utilized energy, (ii) number of charging vehicles, and (iii) total time spent while charging. In this paper, we analyse framework performance and key performance indicator (KPI) values during the pre-lockdown period, soft-lockdown period, and post-lockdown lift-off period to show how the pandemic situations and governmental lockdown regulations can impact EV grid performance and EV charging business. In addition to that, we test a daily framework anomaly detection flow that tracks the global predictive performance of the predictive models on the EV grid, to detect if the framework detects this to be a situation that is novel (anomalous) during the soft-lockdown period. Results show that changes in the behaviour during the lockdown period reduce electric demand on EV charging spots, with customers having lower demand and similar behaviour as in other European countries. Furthermore, the soft-lockdown period is detected as a period with more extreme anomalous values for supervised models, and this is shown as an increase in residual anomaly values, flagging 3 times more days as an extreme anomaly than in the normal periods.","output":"EV charging station monitoring frameworkA case study of Croatia: Performance analysis and anomaly detection under pandemic situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir, an intravenous nucleotide prodrug, has been approved for treating COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and pediatric patients. Upon administration, remdesivir can be readily hydrolyzed to form its active form GS-441524, while the cleavage of the carboxylic ester into GS-704277 is the first step for remdesivir activation. This study aims to assign the key enzymes responsible for remdesivir hydrolysis in humans, as well as to investigate the kinetics of remdesivir hydrolysis in various enzyme sources. The results showed that remdesivir could be hydrolyzed to form GS-704277 in human plasma and the microsomes from human liver (HLMs), lung (HLuMs) and kidney (HKMs), while the hydrolytic rate of remdesivir in HLMs was the fastest. Chemical inhibition and reaction phenotyping assays suggested that human carboxylesterase 1 (hCES1A) played a predominant role in remdesivir hydrolysis, while cathepsin A (CTSA), acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BchE) contributed to a lesser extent. Enzymatic kinetic analyses demonstrated that remdesivir hydrolysis in hCES1A (SHUTCM) and HLMs showed similar kinetic plots and much closed Km values to each other. Meanwhile, GS-704277 formation rates were strongly correlated with the CES1A activities in HLM samples from different individual donors. Further investigation revealed that simvastatin (a therapeutic agent for adjuvant treating COVID-19) strongly inhibited remdesivir hydrolysis in both recombinant hCES1A and HLMs. Collectively, our findings reveal that hCES1A plays a predominant role in remdesivir hydrolysis in humans, which are very helpful for predicting inter-individual variability in response to remdesivir and for guiding the rational use of this anti-COVID-19 agent in clinical settings.","output":"Human carboxylesterase 1A plays a predominant role in the hydrolytic activation of remdesivir in humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in December 2019, the spread of SARS-CoV2 infection has been escalating rapidly around the world.

Weapons inspectors themselves are often forced to sift through alternative narratives of events and inconsistent reporting, and they regularly see their credibility and conclusions questioned in the face of government politics or public biases.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All employees of a tertiary eye centre and a research institute of ophthalmology were offered antibody testing in May 2020, using a sequential combination of different validated assays/antigens and point-of-care (POC) testing for a subset (NCT04446338). Before taking blood, a systematic inquiry into past symptoms, known contacts and a subjective self-assessment was documented. The correlations between serostatus, patient contacts and demographic characteristics were analysed. Different tests were compared by Kappa statistics. RESULTS: Among 318 participants, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 9 employees. Chemiluminescence assays (chemiluminescence immunoassay and electrochemiluminescence) showed superior specificity and high reproducibility, compared with ELISA and POC results. In contrast to the low seropositivity (2.8%) of healthcare workers, higher than that of the other departments of the hospital, a large proportion mistakenly assumed that they might have already been infected. Antiviral antibody titres increased and remained on a plateau for at least 3 months.

METHODS: A total of 124 nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients were tested by RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR. Sensitivities and specificities of RT-LAMP compared with RT-qPCR were analyzed as a function of time from onset. RESULTS: Up to the 9th day after onset, the RT-LAMP had positivity of 92.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity compared with RT-qPCR was 100%. After the 10th day of onset, however, the positivity of RT-LAMP decreased to less than 25%, and concordance of positivity between the two methods was below 60%. The limit of detection of RT-LAMP was 6.7 copies/reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Until the 9th day after the onset of symptoms, RT-LAMP had the same diagnostic accuracy as RT-qPCR. These finding suggest that RT-LAMP can be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 as an alternative to RT-qPCR in the acute symptomatic phase of COVID-19.","output":"Diagnostic accuracy of LAMP versus PCR over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hyperglycaemia has emerged as an important risk factor for death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between blood glucose (BG) levels and in-hospital mortality in non-critically patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre study involving patients hospitalized in Spain. Patients were categorized into three groups according to admission BG levels: <140 mg/dL, 140C180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 11,312 patients, only 2128 (18.9%) had diabetes and 2289 (20.4%) died during hospitalization. The in-hospital mortality rates were 15.7% (<140 mg/dL), 33.7% (140C180 mg) and 41.1% (>180 mg/dL), p<.001. The cumulative probability of mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycaemia compared to patients with normoglycaemia (log rank, p<.001), independently of pre-existing diabetes. Hyperglycaemia (after adjusting for age, diabetes, hypertension and other confounding factors) was an independent risk factor of mortality (BG >180 mg/dL: HR 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31C1.73) (BG 140C180 mg/dL; HR 1.48; 95%CI: 1.29C1.70). Hyperglycaemia was also associated with requirement for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: KEY MESSAGE: Admission hyperglycaemia is a stronger and independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. Screening for hyperglycaemia, in patients without diabetes, and early treatment of hyperglycaemia should be mandatory in the management of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Admission hyperglycaemia should not be overlooked in all patients regardless prior history of diabetes.","output":"Admission hyperglycaemia as a predictor of mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 regardless of diabetes status: data from the Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Energy poverty is one of the main challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Research on energy poverty is becoming a common focus of scholars in many areas. Bibliometrics can help researchers dig deep into the information of specific research fields from a quantitative perspective. In this study, we collected 1018 research papers in the field of energy poverty published in the period 1999C2019 from the Web of Science databases and conducted a bibliometric analysis on them. Cleaning and screening of sample papers, matrix construction, and visualization were performed using Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and HistCite, summarizing the internal and external characteristics of the papers. With regard to external characteristics, a total of 982 research institutions in 80 regions conducted research in this field. There is extensive cooperation between the countries, and the UK, the USA, Australia, and Italy play the most active role in the cooperation network. With regard to internal characteristics, we found the two most representative citation paths: one path starts from the concerns of energy-poor groups and stops at an ethical discussion on energy poverty; the second path is based on the existing technological path, continuously developing coping policies, evaluation methods, and a conceptual framework for dealing with energy poverty. Furthermore, through coupling analysis, we discovered four focuses of energy poverty research: improvement of definition, improvement of evaluation methods, effects of coping policy, and energy justice. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing papers, this paper reveals some limitations of previous studies and recommends some promising directions for future research on energy poverty.","output":"Mapping the Worldwide Trends on Energy Poverty Research: A Bibliometric Analysis (1999C2019)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical trials have shown that intravenous albumin and decompressive craniectomy to treat early refractory intracranial hypertension can cause harm in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

This study was performed to gather electronic clinic utilization data and to better define barriers to visit completion. METHODS A retrospective review of 199 patients cared for by a general surgery service with subsequent referral to the electronic clinic (January 2019 to June 2019) was performed. Data regarding demographics, medical characteristics, travel distance, and postoperative complications were collected. Patients were categorized based upon visit completion. The 2 and Fisher exact analyses were performed as appropriate. Reasons for cancellations were categorized. RESULTS More than 1/5 of all patients (21.6%) failed to complete the visit. No differences were observed in completion rates according to the type of operation, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and age. The failed-completion group had a significantly (P < .05) higher proportion of non-Caucasian patients and those with a marital status of single. Travel distance had no impact. Complication rates were low. Pre-clinic readmission within 30 days contributed to failed completion. Reasons for cancellation included medical issues, technical difficulties, and patient preference to have no follow-up in the electronic clinic. CONCLUSION Several factors contribute to a patient's failure to complete an electronic clinic visit including marital status, medical complications, technical issues, and patient preference. Electronic clinic utilization patterns also demonstrate racial disparities.

The mediation effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation was also examined. METHOD: A total of 684 school-going adolescents aged 14-17 years old were recruited via multistage cluster sampling. Bivariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's correlation analysis. The mediation model was tested using SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes. RESULTS: The results showed that mother closeness, father closeness and self-efficacy had significant negative correlation with suicidal ideation. Specifically, self-efficacy emerged as a partial mediator in the relation between mother closeness and suicidal ideation. Self-efficacy also fully mediated the relationship between father closeness and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings implied that mother closeness had stronger correlation with adolescents' suicidal ideation compared to father closeness, while self-efficacy plays an important role in the relationship between parental closeness and suicidal ideation.

MethodsThe epitopes and pathways of escape for Spike-specific antibodies in individuals with diverse infection and vaccination history were profiled using Phage-DMS. Principal component analysis was performed to identify regions of antibody binding along the Spike protein that differentiate the samples from one another. Within these epitope regions we determined potential escape mutations by comparing antibody binding of peptides containing wildtype residues versus peptides containing a mutant residue. ResultsIndividuals with mild infection had antibodies that bound to epitopes in the S2 subunit within the fusion peptide and heptad-repeat regions, whereas vaccinated individuals had antibodies that additionally bound to epitopes in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, a pattern that was also observed in individuals with severe disease due to infection. Epitope binding appeared to change over time after vaccination, but other covariates such as mRNA vaccine dose, mRNA vaccine type, and age did not affect antibody binding to these epitopes. Vaccination induced a relatively uniform escape profile across individuals for some epitopes, whereas there was much more variation in escape pathways in in mildly infected individuals. In the case of antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region, which was a common response to both infection and vaccination, the escape profile after infection was not altered by subsequent vaccination. ConclusionsThe finding that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination resulted in binding to additional epitopes beyond what was seen after infection suggests protection could vary depending on the route of exposure to Spike antigen. The relatively conserved escape pathways to vaccine-induced antibodies relative to infection-induced antibodies suggests that if escape variants emerge, they may be readily selected for across vaccinated individuals. Given that the majority of people will be first exposed to Spike via vaccination and not infection, this work has implications for predicting the selection of immune escape variants at a population level.

Basic ICU and patient demographics including nutrition therapy delivery were collected on the survey day. Physical activity for patients with and without COVID infections was categorized using the ICU mobility scale (IMS). Multivariable regression analysis of nutrition was conducted using ICU parameters. RESULTS: The survey included 627 non-COVID and 602 COVID patients. A higher proportion of COVID-19 patients received energy 20 kcal/kg/day (55% vs. 45%; p = 0.0007) and protein 1.2 g/kg/day (45% vs. 35%; p = 0.0011) compared to non-COVID patients. Enteral nutrition was provided to most COVID patients even with prone positioning (91%).

In addition, controversy remains about whether racial disparity in outcomes following MBS exists. Therefore, the aim of this analysis was to determine if race independently predicts outcomes in MBS patients with PSOT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with PSOT undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were identified in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project (MBSAQIP) database. Patients were stratified by race (Black and White). Propensity score matching was utilized to adjust for multiple demographic variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for overall and bariatric-related morbidity. RESULTS: Of 335 MBS patients with PSOT, 250 (75%) were white and 85 (25%) were black patents. Procedure-type and surgical approach (p > 0.1) were similarly distributed. Black patients were more likely (p < 0.05) to have hypertension dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, and be on chronic steroids). Mortality and morbidity were similar. Black patients had significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of renal failure, pulmonary complications, and emergency department visits in unmatched analysis. After propensity score matching, 82 patients in each cohort were identified and were similar at baseline (p > 0.5). In the matched analysis, black patients had higher overall (17% vs. 10%, p = 0.12) and bariatric-related morbidity (14% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.05). In addition, black patients had significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of postoperative pneumonias, progressive renal insufficiency, and emergency department visits. On multivariable regression analysis, black race did not independently predict overall or bariatric-related morbidity.

Ivermectin (IVM), a macrocytic lactone with a wide anti-parasitary spectrum, has shown potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures. Methods: We completed a pilot, randomized, controlled, outcome-assessor blinded clinical trial with the goal of evaluating the antiviral activity of high dose IVM in COVID-19 patients. Eligible patients were adults (aged 18 to 69 years) with mild or moderate RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptoms onset. 45 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to standard of care plus oral IVM at 06 mg/kg/day for 5 days versus standard of care. The primary endpoint was viral load reduction in respiratory secretions at day-5. Viral load in respiratory secretions was measured through quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of IVM in plasma were measured on multiple treatment days.Findings: The trial run between May 18 and September 29, 2020 with 45 randomized patients (30 in the IVM group and 15 controls). There was no difference in viral load reduction between groups but a significant difference in reduction was found in patients with higher median plasma IVM levels (72% IQR 59 C 77) versus untreated controls (42% IQR 31 C 73) (p=0004). The mean ivermectin plasma concentration levels also showed a positive correlation with viral decay rate (r:047, p=002). Adverse events were reported in 5 (33%) patients in the controls and 13 (43%) in the IVM treated group, without a relationship between IVM plasma levels and adverse events.Interpretation: A concentration dependent antiviral activity of oral high dose IVM was identified in this pilot trial at a dosing regimen that was well tolerated. Large trials with clinical endpoints are necessary to determine the clinical utility of IVM in COVID-19.Trial Registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT004381884.Funding Statement: This work was supported by grant IP-COVID-19-625 from Agencia Nacional de Promocin de la Investigacin, el Desarrollo Tecnolgico y la Innovacin, Argentina and Laboratorio ELEA/Phoenix, Argentina.Declaration of Interests: AK reports grants from Laboratorio Elea/Phoenix.

Prior to the nationwide epidemic of COVID-19, there was a unique, large-scale, regional outbreak in Daegu and Gyeonsangbuk-do (DG) in Korea in the spring of 2020. We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on KD by comparing the characteristics of KD incidence between epidemic and non-epidemic regions in Korea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed nationwide Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) data to estimate KD incidence from February 2019 to July 2020. Patients below 18 years who were admitted with KD and administered both intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin (ICD-10 code M303 for KD) were included in the study. We compared the incidence of KD in DG and other regions by analyzing the period-specific incidence from February to May before and after the COVID-19 era. RESULTS: A total of 4461 patients were identified to have KD nationwide from February 2019 to July 2020. The nationwide incidence of KD was significantly reduced during this period compared with the period from February 2018 to July 2019 (p < 0.001). In the DG region, within the 0C4-years age group, there was no significant difference in the incidence of KD between periods (p = 0.714). In the 5C9 years age group, a significant decrease in KD incidence was observed in the DG region and all other regions from February 2019 to July 2020. CONCLUSION: There was a significant decrease in nationwide KD incidence during and until 2 months after the local epidemic in Korea. However, no significant decrease in KD incidence was observed in the 0C4 years age group in the DG region where the local COVID-19 outbreak occurred. A larger study is necessary to determine the correlation between KD in this age group and the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"Effect of a Regional Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Kawasaki Disease in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accounting for over 60% of global animal agriculture (FAOSTAT, [2]) and not yet hosting legislative protection against cruelty, China has been the focus of international animal welfare interest for many years.

Basic ingredients of population dynamics models are typically a growth rate, a saturation term in the form of Verhulsts logistic brake, and a functional response accounting for interspecific interactions. However intraspecific interactions are not usually included in the equations. The simplest models use linear terms to represent a simple picture of the nature, meanwhile to represent more complex landscapes, it is necessary to include more terms with higher order or analytically more complex. The problem to use a simpler or more complex model depends on many factors: mathematical, ecological, or computational. To address it, here we discuss a new model based on a previous logistic-mutualistic model. We have generalised the interspecific terms (for antagonistic and competitive relationships) and we have also included new polynomial terms to explain any intraspecific interaction. We show that by adding simple intraspecific terms, new free-equilibrium solutions appear driving a much richer dynamics. These new solutions could represent more realistic ecological landscapes by including a new high order term.","output":"A general model of population dynamics accounting for multiple kinds of interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic has impacted the lives and health of persons worldwide and although majority of COVID19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, pain emerges as an important feature of COVID19 infection. About 15C20% of patients progress to a severe condition that requires hospitalization. Although the disease was initially reported as a respiratory syndrome, other systems such as cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems may be affected in the acute stages, increasing the need for continuous support to treat multiple sequelae caused by the disease. Due to the severity of the disease, damages found after discharge should also be considered. Providing multidisciplinary interventions promoting physical and psychological recovery in the first stages of hospitalization can minimize these damages. Cognitive, physical and psychological dysfunction reported by COVID19 patients after discharge can have profound effects on quality of life. Pain is usually part of this dysfunction, but it is still poorly understood how it affects survivors of COVID19 infections.

Viral RNA concentration was analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regressions or mixed-effect models ResultsOne hundred forty-seven inpatients with influenza A (H3N2) infection were studied (mean age  standard deviation, 7216 years). Viral RNA concentration at presentation positively correlated with symptom scores and was significantly higher than that among time-matched outpatients (control subjects). Patients with major comorbidities had high viral RNA concentration even when presenting >2 days after symptom onset (mean  standard deviation, 5.061.85 vs 3.622.13 log(10) copies/mL; P=.005; , +0.86 [95% confidence interval, +0.03 to +1.68]). Viral RNA concentration demonstrated a nonlinear decrease with time; 26% of oseltamivir-treated and 57% of untreated patients had RNA detected at 1 week after symptom onset. Oseltamivir started on or before symptom day 4 was independently associated with an accelerated decrease in viral RNA concentration (mean  [standard error], ?1.19 [0.43] and ?0.68 [0.33] log(10) copies/mL for patients treated on day 1 and days 2C3, respectively; P<.05) and viral RNA clearance at 1 week (odds ratio, 0.10 [95% confidence interval, 0.03C0.35] and 0.30 [0.10C0.90] for patients treated on day 1C2 and day 3C4, respectively).

Bilateral interstitial pneumonia is the hallmark of this disease. Liver is the second viral target for frequency and AST and ALT elevation is a common finding. From February 2020, two different cholangiopathies have been reported in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this article is to review the cases so far described in order to share information and awareness about these new clinical entities. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV2 seems to trigger autoimmunity and two cases of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) have been developed after viral infection while more than 30 patients have showed a rapidly progressing cholangiopathy with features of secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC). For what concerns SSC pathogenesis, a theory combining multiple hits is the most recognized. SUMMARY: Two different cholangiopathies have been reported in patients after severe-COVID-19. Attention should be paid to the development of cholestasis in ICU setting but above all after discharge and liver function tests should be, therefore, periodically performed. No treatment strategies are available and liver transplantation remains the last option in individuals with liver failure because of SSC.

Design/methodology/approach: A set of stock characteristics and corporate governance variables which may affect price overreaction and volatility were identified following a review of the literature. A dummy variable was created for the cross-sectional analysis to take into account the unique sector effect in the consumer staples sector. Out of sample analysis was conducted to confirm the robustness of the main results. Findings: The empirical results consistently show that size, dividend and trading volume determine the stock price reactions when the market is in turmoil during the pandemic period. Board size and average board tenure exhibit moderate effects on reducing the stock price reactions, but the effects become insignificant while controlling for the firm characteristics in the regressions. The results remain robust when tested out of the sample. More interestingly, a consumer staples sector effect is identified and tested. The test results show that the consumer staples sector effect mitigates the stock price reactions. Practical implications: The results have practical implications for investors who aim to manage desired levels of risk in their portfolios during the pandemic. The results also provide meaningful insights to stock market speculators regarding pandemic-related speculation opportunities.

Therefore, it is important to promote the release of osteogenic/angiogenic growth factors. Since the discovery of heparin, its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer functions have been extensively studied for over a century. Although the application of heparin is widely used in the orthopedic field, its auxiliary effect on bone regeneration is yet to be unveiled. Specifically, approximately one-third of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily is bound to heparin and heparan sulfate, among which TGF-1, TGF-2, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are the most common growth factors used. In addition, heparin can also improve the delivery and retention of BMP-2 in vivo promoting the healing of large bone defects at hyper physiological doses. In blood vessel formation, heparin still plays an integral part of fracture healing by cooperating with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Importantly, since heparin binds to growth factors and release components in nanomaterials, it can significantly facilitate the controlled release and retention of growth factors [such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), BMP, and PDGF] in vivo. Consequently, the knowledge of scaffolds or delivery systems composed of heparin and different biomaterials (including organic, inorganic, metal, and natural polymers) is vital for material-guided bone regeneration research.

Recent research agrees on the existence of two cognitive processes, intuitive and analytic cognition. Different individuals lean toward one of these processes with varying degrees of strength, influencing day-to-day behavior, perceptions, and decisions. Thinking dispositions might influence, at the same time, vaccine acceptance and perceived risks of vaccine-preventable disease, but the implications of individuals' cognitive differences for vaccination uptake have seldom been addressed from a sociological standpoint. OBJECTIVE We bridge this gap by adopting a dual-process framework of cognition and investigate how thinking styles have a direct association with vaccine hesitancy and an indirect one through perceptions of risk. METHODS We use data from original surveys carried out between September and November 2019 on a sample of the Italian population, participating in an online panel run by a major Italian survey company. We use Karlson, Holm, and Breen (KHB) decomposition to compare coefficients of nested-nonlinear models, separate the direct and indirect association of cognitive processes with vaccine hesitancy, and disentangle the contribution of each measure of risk perception. RESULTS Net of individual socio-demographic characteristics, intuitive thinking is positively associated with the likelihood of being vaccine hesitant, and this direct association is as important as the indirect one through risk perceptions. Affective risk perceptions account for over half of the indirect association, underlining the centrality of affective versus probabilistic approaches to risk perception. CONCLUSION This study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of including cognitive characteristics in vaccine hesitancy research, and empirically showing individuals' qualitatively complex perceptions of risks. Taking into account individuals' preferred cognitive style and affective concerns might be important in developing better tailored communication strategies to contain vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Do cognitive styles affect vaccine hesitancy?

However, its impact on the digestive system has been shown, and various clinical gastrointestinal manifestations of this disease have been recognized. Some reports have shown acute pancreatitis (AP) as the initial symptom in patients with COVID-19. AP may be a consequence of direct pancreatic damage by the virus because pancreatic acinar cells contain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 can bind to these receptors, causing pancreatic injury. Moreover, AP may be a secondary indicator of cytokine storms and altered inflammatory responses. Our review of the literature shows that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a new etiological infectious factor related to AP.

More sophisticated digital platforms such as symptom checkers have recently become pervasive; however, little is known about their use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand young adults (18-34 years old) perspectives on the use of the Google search engine versus a symptom checker, as well as to identify the barriers and enablers for using a symptom checker for self-triage and self-diagnosis. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive case study research design was used. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 young adults enrolled in a university in Ontario, Canada. All participants were given a clinical vignette and were asked to use a symptom checker (WebMD Symptom Checker or Babylon Health) while thinking out loud, and were asked questions regarding their experience. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and imported into the NVivo software program. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. RESULTS: Using the Google search engine was perceived to be faster and more customizable (ie, ability to enter symptoms freely in the search engine) than a symptom checker; however, a symptom checker was perceived to be useful for a more personalized assessment. After having used a symptom checker, most of the participants believed that the platform needed improvement in the areas of accuracy, security and privacy, and medical jargon used. Given these limitations, most participants believed that symptom checkers could be more useful for self-triage than for self-diagnosis. Interestingly, more than half of the participants were not aware of symptom checkers prior to this study and most believed that this lack of awareness about the existence of symptom checkers hindered their use. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness related to the existence of symptom checkers and their integration into the health care system are required to maximize benefits related to these platforms.

These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.","output":"Global analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using simple epidemiological models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the pathogenesis of the infectious process in the respiratory tract by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses, two stages can be distinguished: early (etiotropic) and late (pathogenetic) ones In the first stage, when the virus multiplication and accumulation are prevalent under insufficient host immune response, the use of chemotherapeutic agents blocking the reproduction of the virus is reasonable to suppress the development of the disease This article considers six major chemotherapeutic classes aimed at certain viral targets: inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase, inhibitors of viral protease Mpro, inhibitors of proteolytic activation of viral protein S allowing virus entry into the target cell, inhibitors of virus uncoating in cellular endosomes, compounds of exogenous interferons, and compounds of natural and recombinant virus-neutralizing antibodies In the second stage, when the multiplication of the virus decreases and threatening pathological processes of excessive inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis events develop, a pathogenetic therapeutic approach including extracorporeal blood oxygenation, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial therapy seems to be the most effective way for the patients recovery  ѧԧ֧ߧ֧٧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧԧ ֧, ӧ٧ӧѧߧߧԧ  ֧ڧѧߧ ѧܧ ܧߧѧӧڧѧާ SARS, MERS, Covid-2019  է , ާاߧ ӧէ֧ݧڧ էӧ ѧէڧ: ѧߧߧ (ڧߧ)  ٧էߧ (ѧԧ֧ߧ֧ڧ֧ܧ)  ֧ӧ ѧէڧ, ܧԧէ էާڧߧڧ ѧ٧ާߧا֧ߧڧ  ߧѧܧݧ֧ߧڧ ӧڧ, ܧѧ٧ѧߧ ڧާ֧ߧ֧ߧڧ ڧާڧ֧ѧ֧ӧڧ֧ܧڧ ֧է, ҧݧܧڧڧ ѧ٧ާߧا֧ߧڧ ӧڧ  ѧ ѧާ֧ߧ 6 ԧݧѧӧߧ ڧާڧ֧ѧ֧ӧڧ֧ܧڧ ܧݧѧ, ߧѧѧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ߧ ѧ٧ݧڧߧ ӧڧߧ ާڧ֧ߧ: ڧߧԧڧҧڧ ӧڧߧ -ݧڧާ֧ѧ٧, ڧߧԧڧҧڧ ӧڧߧ ֧ѧ٧ pro, ڧߧԧڧҧڧ ֧ݧڧڧ֧ܧ ѧܧڧӧѧڧ ӧڧߧԧ ҧ֧ݧܧ S, ֧ӧݧ֧ԧ ӧ ӧڧ  ܧݧ֧ܧ-ާڧ֧ߧ, ڧߧԧڧҧڧ ӧڧߧ է֧֧ڧߧڧ٧ѧڧ  ܧݧ֧ߧ ߧէާѧ, ֧ѧѧ ܧ٧ԧ֧ߧߧԧ ڧߧ֧֧ߧ, ֧ѧѧ ڧէߧ  ֧ܧާҧڧߧѧߧߧ ӧڧߧ֧ۧѧݧڧ٧ڧ ѧߧڧ֧  ӧ ѧէڧ, ܧԧէ ѧ٧ާߧا֧ߧڧ ӧڧ ѧէѧ֧  էާڧߧڧ ԧاѧڧ ѧݧԧڧ֧ܧڧ ֧ ڧ٧ҧߧԧ ӧѧݧ֧ߧڧ, ԧ ֧ڧѧߧԧ էڧ֧ ڧߧէާ, ֧ܧ ݧ֧ԧߧ ܧѧߧ, ԧڧܧڧ  ԧاѧ֧ԧ ֧ڧ, ߧ ֧ӧ ݧѧ ӧէ ڧާ֧ߧ֧ߧڧ ѧԧ֧ߧ֧ڧ֧ܧڧ ֧է, ѧܧڧ ܧѧ ܧѧܧѧݧߧѧ ܧڧԧ֧ߧѧڧ ܧӧ, է֧٧ڧߧܧڧܧѧڧߧߧ, ڧӧӧѧݧڧ֧ݧߧ  ѧߧڧҧѧܧ֧ڧѧݧߧ ֧ѧ֧ӧڧ֧ܧڧ ֧էӧ  ާ֧ڧڧ","output":"ݧ֧ܧݧߧ ڧ֧ߧ  ڧާڧ֧ѧڧ ߧѧӧڧߧ ߧ֧ܧڧ"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 merupakan wabah penyakit yang mematikan penyebaran COVID-19 di Indonesia sangat mempengaruhi kesehatan masyarakat Indonesia.

A better understanding of B- and T-cell immunity is critical to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A cohort of 129 patients with COVID-19 and 20 suspected cases were enrolled in this study, and a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) and a magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (MCLIA) were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG detection. Additionally, 127 patients with COVID-19 were selected for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate B-cell immunity, and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified in 95 patients with COVID-19 to evaluate T-cell immunity. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays for detecting SARS-CoV infection were > 90%, comparable with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction detection. IgM antibody levels peaked on day 13 and began to fall on day 21, while IgG antibody levels peaked on day 17 and were maintained until tracking ended. Lymphocyte and subset enumeration suggested that lymphocytopenia occurred in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: LFIA-IgM/IgG and MCLIA-IgM/IgG assays can indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection, which elicits an antibody response.

Salmonella induced disease mainly affects buffalo calves and is characterized by severe gastrointestinal lesions, profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration, septicemia and death; in adults it can also induce termination of pregnancy. The main source of infection in the herd is asymptomatic elderly animals that release high bacterial charges through the feces. Other sources of infection are contaminated fodder and water; the infection can also be transmitted by rodents, wild birds, insects and humans. There are several serotypes of Salmonella reported in the literature capable of infecting the buffalo. This work describes an important outbreak of Salmonellosis that occurred in young subjects of a buffalo farm located in the province of Salerno. It is supported by a new serotype of Salmonella so far never described and included in the KauffmannCWhite classification. ABSTRACT: This case report describes for the first-time cases of severe gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves due to a new serovar of Salmonella enterica. The study was carried out on fecal matrix collected from live water buffalo calves that showed profuse diarrhea, severe dehydration and fever, exhibiting a systemic course. Culture and molecular investigations identified the pathogens isolated from intestinal contents as two Salmonella serovars, Salmonella enterica enterica O:35 and a new serovar of Salmonella enterica. The isolates showed multi-drug resistance. Timely diagnosis associated with a targeted antimicrobial treatment were found to be sufficient for the survival and recovery of the infected animals. Herd vaccines prepared from isolated pathogens were used to prevent further deaths of the calves.","output":"Identification of a New Serovar of Salmonella enterica in Mediterranean Buffalo Calves (Bubalus bubalis)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can have a subsequent positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after they are discharged from the hospital.

Oral or intravenous rehydration was proven effective in reducing the mortality rates in acute gastroenteritis, although it does not affect the course of the disease. Attempts to identify new therapeutic methods effective in reducing the symptoms of diarrhoea are of interest. Pleurans potential immunomodulatory effect in acute gastrointestinal infection relies on the stimulation of innate immunity. The effectiveness of pleuran (-(1,3/1,6)-d-glucan) administration to treat acute infectious diarrhoea remains unknown. This study evaluates the efficacy of pleuran in reducing diarrhoea duration and the severity of acute gastroenteritis symptoms in children.

By employing a\\"Course Deficit Model\\"we attribute the responsibility for closing the gaps to those who are responsible for the policies that guide the course. When comparing course grades in classes graded using the percent scale with those in courses graded using the 4.0 scale, we find that students identifying as belonging to racial or ethnic minorities underrepresented in physics suffer a grade penalty under both grade scales but suffer an extra penalty under percent scale graded courses. We then use the fraction of A grades each student earns on individual exam items as a proxy for the instructor's perception of each student's understanding of the course material to control for student understanding and find that the extra grade penalty students from groups underrepresented in physics students suffer under percent scale grading is independent of the student's understanding of physics. When we control for more student level variables to determine the source of the grade scale dependent penalty, we find that it is primarily the low F grades (partial credit scores) on exam problems that are the source of these inequities.

PATIENTS Children newly diagnosed with VI, severe vision impairment or blindness (SVI/BL)-that is, visual acuity worse than logMAR 0.5 in both eyes-were identified through active surveillance, with data collection at diagnosis and 1 year later. OUTCOME MEASURE Method of detection of vision/eyes problem. RESULTS 784 children (45%, 356 girls) were identified, of whom 313 (40%) had VI, 471 (60%) had SVI/BL. Additional non-ophthalmic disorders or impairments (VI/SVI/BL 'plus'), were diagnosed in 72% (559/784). Of the 784, 173 children were detected through routine screening (22%), 248 through targeted examinations (32%) and 280 through family self-referral (36%). Parents and carers had only reported symptoms in 55% of children who manifested them, with evidence that families living in socioeconomically deprived areas were less likely to report concerns. Paediatricians were the professionals most likely to raise initial suspicion of visual disability. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that targeted screening and surveillance is important for the detection of full spectrum childhood visual impairment (VI/SVI/BL), as a significant proportion of children will not have symptoms, or their parents or carers will not report symptoms. As paediatricians were the professionals most commonly involved in detection, it would be helpful if their core competencies included the skills needed to undertake simple assessments of vision.","output":"The role of screening and surveillance in the detection of childhood vision impairment and blindness in the UK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arthropods host a range of sex-ratio-distorting selfish elements, including diverse maternally inherited endosymbionts that solely kill infected males. Male-killing heritable microbes are common, reach high frequency, but until recently have been poorly understood in terms of the host-microbe interaction. Additionally, while male killing should generate strong selection for host resistance, evidence of this has been scant. The interface of the microbe with host sex determination is integral to the understanding of how death is sex limited and how hosts can evolve evasion of male killing. We first review current knowledge of the mechanisms diverse endosymbionts use to induce male-specific death. We then examine recent evidence that these agents do produce intense selection for host nuclear suppressor elements. We argue, from our understanding of male-killing mechanisms, that suppression will commonly involve evolution of the host sex determination pathways and that the host's response to male-killing microbes thus represents an unrecognized driver of the diversity of arthropod sex determination. Further work is required to identify the genes and mechanisms responsible for male-killing suppression, which will both determine the components of sex determination (or other) systems associated with suppressor evolution, and allow insight into the mechanism of male killing itself.","output":"Sex determination systems as the interface between male-killing bacteria and their hosts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The malaise in physician practice long known as burnout - a term doctors increasingly balk at - has been exacerbated by the pandemic, as an extensive survey by the Physicians Foundation recently showed.

To accommodate the rising number of critically ill patients, new intensive care units were formed in several hospitals. Here we describe the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in a newly formed COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary cardiac center in Sofia, Bulgaria. MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to Sveta Ekaterina University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, between November 4th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021. Data were collected from electronic and written patient records and charts. ResultsWe identified 38 critical care patients admitted with respiratory failure and treated with mechanical ventilation at our COVID-19 ICU during this period. The median age was 66 (IQR 57-76, range 27-89) and 74% were male. Most patients, 36 (95%), had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Overall, 27 (71%) patients had a concomitant cardiac disease other than hypertension and 24% were recent cardiac surgical patients. Inotropic support was required in 29 (76%) patients, renal replacement therapy in 12 (32%) patients and prone positioning and ECMO were used in 5 (13%) and 2 (5%) patients respectively. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.5 (IQR 5-14) days overall and 9 (IQR 6-13) days for survivors. At 30-days 28 (74%) of patients had died. Overall, 32 (84%) patients died in hospital and only 6 (16%) patients were discharged home. ConclusionsDuring the first major surge of COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria, despite the wave arriving later than in other countries, the healthcare system was largely unprepared. In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was very high at 85%.

Our aim was to assess the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of intestinal colonization with a CTX-M-15 ESBL and OXA-162 carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 (KP5825) in a murine (C57BL/6 male mice) model. Whole genome sequencing of KP5825 strain was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Conjugation assays were carried out by broth mating method. In colonization experiments, 5  106 CFU of KP5825 was administered to the animals by orogastric gavage, and antibiotics were administered in their drinking water for two weeks and were changed every day. The gut colonization rates with KP5825 were assessed by cultivation and qPCR. In each of the stool samples, the gene copy number of blaOXA-162 and blaCTX-M-15 were determined by qPCR. Antibiotic concentrations in the stool were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography and a bioanalytical method. The KP5825 contained four different plasmid replicon types, namely IncFII(K), IncL, IncFIB and ColpVC. IncL (containing the blaOXA-162 resistance gene within a Tn1991.2 genetic element) and IncFII(K) (containing the blaCTX-M-15 resistance gene) plasmids were successfully conjugated. During ampicillin and ceftazidime treatments, colonization rate of KP5825 increased, while, ciprofloxacin treatments in both concentrations (0.1 g/L and 0.5 g/L) led to significantly decreased colonization rates. The gene copy number blaOXA-162 correlated with K. pneumoniae in vivo, while a major elevation was observed in the copy number of blaCTX-M-15 from the first day to the fifteenth day in the 0.5 g/L dose ceftazidime treatment group. Our results demonstrate that commonly used antibiotics may have diverse impacts on the colonization rates of intestinally-carried CPE, in addition to affecting the gene copy number of their resistance genes, thus facilitating their stable persistance and dissemination.","output":"The influence of antibiotics on transitory resistome during gut colonization with CTX-M-15 and OXA-162 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this research is to visualize those countries that would have the greatest impact in terms of sensitivity and vulnerability due to the drop in travels, as a product of the pandemic, with special emphasis on South America.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using two orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100g of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of ~ 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with a ~ 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at ~1/300.

Here, we describe a new design of the MasSpec Pen technology integrated to electrospray ionization (ESI) for direct analysis of clinical swabs and investigate its use for COVID-19 screening. The redesigned MasSpec Pen system incorporates a disposable sampling device refined for uniform and efficient analysis of swab tips via liquid extraction directly coupled to an ESI source. Using this system, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs from 244 individuals including symptomatic COVID-19 positive, symptomatic negative, and asymptomatic negative individuals, enabling rapid detection of rich lipid profiles. Two statistical classifiers were generated based on the lipid information acquired. Classifier 1 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive from asymptomatic PCR-negative individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 76.6%, and specificity of 86.6%, and validation set accuracy of 89.6%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 85.3%. Classifier 2 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive patients from negative individuals including symptomatic PCR-negative patients with moderate to severe symptoms and asymptomatic individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4%, specificity of 77.21%, and sensitivity of 81.8%. Collectively, this study suggests that the lipid profiles detected directly from nasopharyngeal swabs using MasSpec Pen-ESI mass spectrometry (MS) allow fast (under a minute) screening of the COVID-19 disease using minimal operating steps and no specialized reagents, thus representing a promising alternative high-throughput method for screening of COVID-19.","output":"Rapid Screening of COVID-19 Directly from Clinical Nasopharyngeal Swabs Using the MasSpec Pen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global refugee crisis of the 2010s, hundreds of thousands of Syrians fled to Jordan.

The aims of the study were to investigate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics in children and adults with T1D during lockdown and to identify their potentially related factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 130 consecutive patients with T1D (30 children (&#8804;12 years), 24 teenagers (13-17 years), and 76 adults (&#8805;18 years)) using either Dexcom or FreeStyle LibreCGM>70% during the study period, without hybrid closed-loop insulin pump. CGM metrics during the 20 days before and the 20 days after lockdown were calculated. By telephonic contact, we performed validated physical activity and perceived stress questionnaires. RESULTS: In children, significantly lower glucose SD (SDglu) (p=0.029) and time below range (TBR)<54 mg/dL (TBR2) (p=0.029) were detected after lockdown. CGM metrics were comparable in teenagers before and during lockdown. After lockdown, adults improved significantly time in range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dL (p<0.001) and remaining metrics, except percent coefficient of variation and TBR2. In adults, considering the changes in SDglu and TIR occurred before and during lockdown, we identified a group with improved TIR and SDglu who performed more physical activity, one with improved glucose variability who was younger than the other patients, and one with worsened glucose variability who showed higher perceived stress than others. CONCLUSION: In patients with T1D during lockdown, CGM metrics mostly improved in children and adults, whereas it was unchanged in teenagers.

Emergency physicians, anesthesiologists, and primary care physicians became interested in echocardiography and started using it. Such ultrasound examinations performed by a doctor for assessment of disease condition, management, or guidance of treatment at bedside has been called point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Cardiac POCUS is divided into a focused cardiac ultrasound examination (FoCUS) and limited echocardiography. The former is performed by non-experts in echocardiography, such as emergency physicians and anesthesiologists, whereas the latter is usually performed by cardiologists who are experts in echocardiography. FoCUS has an established protocol and evaluation method, and evidence to prove its effectiveness is accumulating. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak reaffirmed the importance of POCUS. Although FoCUS is becoming popular in Japan, an educational program has not been established, and discussion on how to educate medical students and residents will be necessary.

However, COVID-19 also effects life-saving and -prolonging radiotherapy for patients suffering from cancer. METHOD: We have conducted a structured online survey among medical physicists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland from March 23rd to 26th 2020. In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination. RESULTS: 72.4% of the respondent's state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%). 75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks. All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%). DISCUSSION: The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges. The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically. The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business.","output":"Influence of the pandemic dissemination of COVID-19 on radiotherapy practice: A flash survey in Germany, Austria and Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human neocortex is undoubtedly considered a supreme accomplishment in mammalian evolution. It features a prenatally established six-layered structure which remains plastic to the myriad of changes throughout an organism's lifetime. A fundamental feature of neocortical evolution and development is the abundance and diversity of the progenitor cell population and their neuronal and glial progeny. These evolutionary upgrades are partially enabled due to the progenitors' higher proliferative capacity, compartmentalization of proliferative regions, and specification of neuronal temporal identities. The driving force of these processes may be explained by temporal molecular patterning, by which progenitors have intrinsic capacity to change their competence as neocortical neurogenesis proceeds. Thus, neurogenesis can be conceptualized along two timescales of progenitors' capacity to (1) self-renew or differentiate into basal progenitors (BPs) or neurons or (2) specify their fate into distinct neuronal and glial subtypes which participate in the formation of six-layers. Neocortical development then proceeds through sequential phases of proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, and maturation. Temporal molecular patterning, therefore, relies on the precise regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression. An extensive transcriptional regulatory network is accompanied by post-transcriptional regulation that is frequently mediated by the regulatory interplay between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). RBPs exhibit important roles in every step of mRNA life cycle in any system, from splicing, polyadenylation, editing, transport, stability, localization, to translation (protein synthesis). Here, we underscore the importance of RBP functions at multiple time-restricted steps of early neurogenesis, starting from the cell fate transition of transcriptionally primed cortical progenitors. A particular emphasis will be placed on RBPs with mostly conserved but also divergent evolutionary functions in neural progenitors across different species. RBPs, when considered in the context of the fascinating process of neocortical development, deserve to be main protagonists in the story of the evolution and development of the neocortex.","output":"Evolution of the Neocortex Through RNA-Binding Proteins and Post-transcriptional Regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rural communities are disproportionally affected by food insecurity, making them vulnerable to the consequences of supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to food was initially diminished due to food supply disruptions, little is known about the mechanisms through which federal emergency assistance programs impacted food access in rural populations. Through a series of five focus groups in spring 2021, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food access in a rural Appalachian community in Kentucky. Data were analyzed using a Grounded Theory Approach. Findings revealed the following four primary themes: food scarcity in grocery stores; expanded federal food assistance; expanded community food resources; and expanded home gardening. Participants provided details regarding the way increased federal assistance, especially expanded benefits within the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, allowed them to purchase greater quantities of nutritious food. This study unveils the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on one rural population, including the influence of some social determinants of health on food insecurity. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the layered protection of multiple federal emergency assistance programs against food insecurity and the potential for long-term population health promotion in rural areas.","output":"Policy Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Food Insecurity in Rural America: Evidence from Appalachia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess the key laboratory features displayed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients that are associated with mild, moderate, severe, and fatal courses of the disease, and through a longitudinal follow-up, to understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pathophysiology. All severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients admitted to the University Hospital in Motol between March and June 2020 were included in this study. A severe course of COVID-19 was associated with an elevation of proinflammatory markers; an efflux of immature granulocytes into peripheral blood; the activation of CD8 T cells, which infiltrated the lungs; transient liver disease. In particular, the elevation of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and histological signs of cholestasis were highly specific for patients with a severe form of the disease. In contrast, patients with a fatal course of COVID-19 failed to upregulate markers of inflammation, showed discoordination of the immune response, and progressed toward acute kidney failure. COVID-19 is a disease with a multi-organ affinity that is characterized by the activation of innate and cellular adaptive immunity.

The behavioral parameters were: a) locomotor activity (ambulations), b) rearing, c) stereotypy (fine movements, primarily grooming), and d) agoraphobia [(thigmotaxis) a natural tendency to avoid the center of the behavioral chamber]. With each behavioral data point, dopamine (DA) release, and serotonin (5-HT) release were detected within seconds in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the same behaving male Sprague-Dawley rats, using in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). Ibogaine was administered (40 mg/kg IP) for 4 consecutive days. Importantly, the DAergic and the 5-HTergic responses to (SC) cocaine and two behavioral responses, ambulations and central ambulations, were reduced in intensity due to extended time spent in the novel behavioral chamber (habituated). Rearing and fine movement patterns were not habituated. The results show that ibogaine downmodulated the (SC) cocaine-induced increase in NAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and potentiated the (SC) cocaine-induced decrease in NAcc 5-HT release (p < 0.0001). Concurrently, ibogaine downmodulated cocaine-induced ambulation (p < 0.0001) and central ambulation behavior (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the behavioral parameters that did not exhibit habituation, i.e., rearing behavior and fine movement behavior, were not downmodulated by ibogaine (p < 0.1558) (p < 0.3763), respectively. Furthermore, ibogaine itself did not significantly alter NAcc DA release over the 2-h period studied (p < 0.9113) although individual time points were significantly affected bidirectionally. Concurrently ibogaine significantly increased 5-HT release (p < 0.0155). Behaviorally, ibogaine appears to be a weak psychostimulant. The data show a critical modulatory role for 5-HT in ibogaine-cocaine interactions. Also elucidated as critical is the efficacy of ibogaine when the response to (SC) cocaine is decreased due to the habituation of the animals to their environment.","output":"Ibogaine modulates cocaine responses which are altered due to environmental habituation: In vivo microvoltammetric and behavioral studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by a decreased number of platelets. It is an immune system-mediated condition, with formation of antibodies against a structural platelet antigen. Although the pathogenesis remains elusive, primary disease is idiopathic and comprises 80% of cases. However, quite a few secondary causes have been established including Helicobacter pylori, varicella-zoster virus and cytomegalovirus. A few cases with an incidental association with herbal medications have been reported, but this causality has not been studied in detail. Here we present the case of 38-year-old African-American woman who presented with symptomatic thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 5 K/l 1 week after she had consumed herbal tea containing Rumex crispus (yellow dock) and Arctium lappa (burdock). The association between unstudied herbs and ITP needs further research, given the widespread use of these substances and ongoing public uncertainty about their benefits. LEARNING POINTS: Over-the-counter herbal products marketed as having beneficial effects are not always harmless and can have clinically significant side effects. When investigating the causes of thrombocytopenia, physicians should be aware of and search for this rare cause.

Methods: This study enrolled 288 COVID-19 patients in Huangshi Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All patients were divided into ordinary, severe, and critical groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7). Demographic, clinical characteristics and liver biomarkers were compared among the three groups. Results: During hospitalization, AST, TBiL, and ALP levels in ordinary and severe patients fluctuated within the normal range with a rising trend in critical patients except AST. ALT and GGT levels fluctuated within the normal range showing an upward trend, while LDH levels in the critical group exceeded the normal range. Prealbumin showed an upward trend, especially in the severe group. At discharge, AST and LDH levels in ordinary and severe groups were lower than their baselines but increased in the critical group. In contrast to albumin, TBiL levels were increased in ordinary and critical groups while decreased in the severe group. The stratified analysis revealed factors affecting liver function in critical cases included highest temperature 38.0C, age 60 and symptom of hypoxemia. Conclusions: COVID-19 can cause severe hepatic dysfunction in critical patients, requiring early monitoring and intervention.

Patients who receive treatment at concussion specialty clinics, versus primary care, experience faster recovery, thereby reducing patient burden and subsequent medical-related costs. Accessibility to specialty clinics is typically limited by the availability of in-office visits. This is particularly relevant in light of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and subsequent guidance to eliminate all nonCmedically necessary in-clinic visits. Telehealth has been used to effectively deliver in-clinic care across several disciplines including psychiatry, psychology, and neuropsychology. However, a model of telehealth delivered concussion assessment, treatment, and management has not been established. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this paper are to describe a pediatric concussion specialty clinics experiences in delivering telehealth concussion services and to provide preliminary descriptive data on a sample of pediatric telehealth patients with concussions. METHODS: The specialty pediatric concussion clinic described here began providing telehealth services in 2019 and is part of the largest and fastest-growing telehealth hospital network in the United States. The clinical care process will be described, including accessing the telehealth platform, assessment during the initial appointment, injury management including communication with relevant patient stakeholders (eg, parent or guardians, athletic trainers), dissemination of rehabilitation exercises, and nature of follow-up visits. Descriptive data will include patient demographics, the radius of care, the time between the date of injury and initial visit, the average number of follow-up visits, and days until medically cleared for return-to-learn and return-to-play. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 18 patients with concussions who were seen for all of their visits via telehealth between August 2019 and April 2020. The mean age of the sample was 14.5 (SD 2.5) years. The radius of care was a median of 17 (IQR 11.0-31.0) miles from the clinic with a median time between injury and the first visit of 21 (IQR 6.0-41.5) days. The mean number of visits was 2.2 (SD 0.8) with a median days between visits of 5.4 (IQR 3.0-9.3) to manage and treat the concussion. Of the 18 patients, 55.6% (n=10) were medically cleared for return-to-learn or -play in a median of 15.5 (IQR 11.0-29.0) days. CONCLUSIONS: Limited access to health care is a well-understood barrier for receiving quality care. Subsequently, there are increasing demands for flexibility in delivering concussion services remotely and in-clinic.

The device prepares total nucleic acids from extracted swab samples using magnetic silica beads. After reverse transcription the co-purified viral RNA is amplified in accordance with the QIAplex multiplex PCR technology. Hybridized to corresponding QIAGEN LiquiChip beads and labelled with streptavidin R-phycoerythrin, the amplified target sequences are finally detected using a QIAGEN LiquiChip200 workstation. All chemicals needed are either stored freeze-dried on the disposable chip or are provided in liquid form in a reagent cartridge for up to 24 runs. Magnetic stir bars for mixing as well as turning valves with metering structures are integrated into the injection-moulded disposable chip. The core of the controlling instrument is a rotating heating bar construction providing fixed temperatures for fast cycling. PCR times of about half an hour (for 30 cycles) could be achieved for 120 l reactions, making this system the fastest currently available high-volume PCR chip.

The signs and symptoms was investigated, and through biopsy, peripheral T lymphoma and bone marrow infiltration were diagnosed. Discussion SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, which causes COVID-19 disease, is a new virus, whose infection and complications are not fully understood. Lymphoproliferative diseases represent a category of disorders in which lymphocytes proliferate in excessive amounts. One of them is peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which is a rare type of lymphoma, and develops from more mature forms of T-cells. Patients with lymphoproliferative diseases are considered immunocompromised due to compromised humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to several infections, including COVID-19. But little is known about COVID-19 infection when it accompanies or precedes lymphoproliferative disease. Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing lymphoproliferative diseases. However, there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID-19 and lymphoproliferative diseases. Reports often involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of lymphoproliferative diseases. The presentation, clinical findings and therapeutic interventions in a lymphoproliferative disease patient, without other underlying conditions, in the context of COVID-19, is a topic to be discussed. Final Comments There are few reports of patients with lymphoproliferative diseases during or shortly after COVID-19 infection, and the association is not clear. Although COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with hematologic alterations, further research is needed to determine whether lymphoproliferative diseases may also be a potential complication.","output":"PERIPHERAL T-CELL LYMPHOMA ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 INFECTION: A CASE REPORT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An attempt is made to analyze the place of political cartoons in the current socio-political media discourse in the United States The material was the cartoons published in the spring of 2020 from USA Today and Philadelphia Inquirer, the informational occasion for the creation of which was the Covid-19 pandemic The definitions of political cartoons as a multimodal text with a complex coding system is considered in the article It is noted that in this type of text, phenomenological cognitive structures are actualized both through linguistic projection and through visual-spatial images Attention is paid to intertextuality as the basis of political cartoon: the authors proceed from the position that the decoding of meaning by the recipient depends on whether he and the author have common background knowledge It is shown that the Covid-19 pandemic is thematically embedded in the broader socio-political agenda, whereby a successful interpretation requires the recipient to have background knowledge of the current sociopolitical challenges facing the United States, namely the domestic political agenda It is stated that the studied cartoons are distinguished by their reliance on precedent, and the actualization of background knowledge occurs through a combination of the visual and verbal components of the text It is concluded that among the linguistic means of creating a satirical effect, a play on words is distinguished based on the literal and figurative meaning of individual lexical units","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic in Political Cartoons of the American Press: an Experience of Multimodal Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Palliative care is a holistic approach to care for people with chronic, advanced, and life-threatening illnesses.

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission. FINDINGS: From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 942 [95% CI 656C1002]; p<00001), being male (167 [119C234]; p=0003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (195 [136C280]; p<0001) and cardiovascular disease (232 [147C364]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (118 [081C172]; p=0380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

This study investigates the challenges confronting e-learning in higher education in Nigeria amid COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon data collected through a structured questionnaire administered to 395 lecturers in various disciplines in private, state and federal universities in Nigeria, the study adopts a quantitative research method. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings indicate that Nigeria Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are still in the early stage of adopting the e-learning mode of study. In addition, there was no existing e-learning curriculum before the pandemic. Also, adopting e-learning mode of teaching was an uphill task for both the lecturers and the learners, given the lack of experience in information and communications technology usage and inadequate infrastructure to support e-learning. Research limitations/implications: A major limitation of the study is the inability to investigate the challenges facing students in using e-learning tools due to the unavailability of access to students during the lockdown. However, the limitations create opportunities for further studies into the subject matter. Originality/value: The study is timely given that HEIs in Nigeria and some other countries in Africa are yet to adopt blended teaching methods. Literature reveals that most HEIs in Nigeria are using only brick and mortar mode of teaching despite the benefit of blended learning in a pandemic situation. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Challenges confronting e-learning in higher education institutions in Nigeria amid Covid -19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface ozone is a major pollutant threatening public health, agricultural production and natural ecosystems. While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to 60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.","output":"Avoiding high ozone pollution in Delhi, India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundNovel variants of concern (VOCs) have been associated with both increased infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to age. Whether relative increases in virulence of novel VOCs is similar across the age spectrum, or is limited to some age groups, is unknown. MethodsWe created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario, Canada testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and August 30, 2021 (n=233,799). Cases were classified as N501Y-positive VOC, probable Delta VOC, or VOC undetected. We constructed age-specific logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of N501Y-postive or Delta VOC infections on infection severity, using hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for sex, time, health unit, vaccination status, comorbidities, immune compromise, long-term care residence, healthcare worker status, and pregnancy. ResultsInfection with either N501Y-positive or Delta VOCs was associated with significant elevations in risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in younger and older adults, compared to infections where a VOC was not detected. Delta VOC increased hospitalization risk in children under 10 by a factor of 2.5 (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 5.1) compared to non-VOC. For most VOC-outcome combinations there was no heterogeneity in adverse outcomes by age. However, there was an inverse relationship between age and relative increase in risk of death with delta VOC, with younger age groups showing a greater relative increase in risk of death than older individuals. InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 VOCs appear to be associated with increased relative virulence of infection in all age groups, though low absolute numbers of outcomes in younger individuals make estimates in these groups imprecise.","output":"Age-Specific Changes in Virulence Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 and associated social distancing has presented challenges for individuals engaging in face-to-face mutual help groups (MHGs) such as Alcoholics Anonymous for alcohol use recovery. Online MHGs may be particularly appealing to individuals with limited access or inclination to attend in-person MHGs. We examined engagement within the popular StopDrinking online MHG, hypothesizing that engagement would increase due to demand for virtual peer support as COVID-19 social distancing progressed. METHODS: We collected publicly available engagement data for StopDrinking from February 19, 2018 through April 30, 2020 while considering March and April of 2020 as months initially impacted by voluntary or mandated COVID-19 social distancing. Using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we predicted daily engagement for this social distancing time period based on all available engagement data collected before April 2020. Kalman filtering with 95% prediction limits was employed to define significant thresholds for observed data to reside within. RESULTS: All days of observed engagement in March and April 2020 were lower than corresponding predicted values. Observed engagement fell below the lower 95% prediction limit for 36% of days, with 15 days in March and 7 days in April having significantly lower than predicted engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low activity on StopDrinking may signal broader population trends of problematic alcohol use and recovery disengagement during the initial COVID-19 social distancing timeframe. Continued investigation of online MHGs is needed to understand their potential for monitoring population health trends and to understand how such groups might support alcohol use recovery in contexts of crisis and isolation.","output":"COVID-19 Social Distancing and Online Mutual Help Engagement for Alcohol Use Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The diverse Asian American population has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but due to limited data and other factors, disparities experienced by this population are hidden. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the Asian American communitys experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 and June 23, 2020, using a multipronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey question topics included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. RESULTS: Among 1297 Asian American respondents, only 3.1% (39/1273) had previously been tested for COVID-19, and 46.6% (392/841) stated that they could not find a place to get tested. In addition, about two-thirds of respondents (477/707) reported feeling stressed, and 22.6% (160/707) reported feeling depressed. Furthermore, 5.6% (72/1275) of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32.2% (246/763) had lost their regular jobs and 22.5% (172/763) had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70.1% (890/1269) of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their home to go to public places (eg, grocery stores, church, and school). CONCLUSIONS: We found that Asian Americans had lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, a high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and a high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (eg, not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multilingual and multicultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccination programs.","output":"A Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Asian Americans: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hybrid MRI-linac (MRL) systems enable daily multiparametric quantitative MRI to assess tumor response to radiotherapy. Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) may provide time efficient means of rapid multiparametric quantitative MRI. The accuracy of MRF, however, relies on adequate control over system imperfections, such as eddy currents and $B_1^+$, which are different and not as well established on MRL systems compared to diagnostic systems. In this study we investigate the technical feasibility of gradient spoiled 2D MRF on a 1.5T MRL. We show with phantom experiments that the MRL generates reliable MRF signals that are temporally stable during the day and have good agreement with spin-echo reference measurements. Subsequent in-vivo MRF scans in healthy volunteers and a patient with a colorectal liver metastasis showed good image quality, where the quantitative values of selected organs corresponded with the values reported in literature. Therefore we conclude that gradient spoiled 2D MRF is feasible on a 1.5T MRL with similar performance as on a diagnostic system. The precision and accuracy of the parametric maps are sufficient for further investigation of the clinical utility of MRF for online quantitatively MRI-guided radiotherapy.","output":"Technical feasibility of magnetic resonance fingerprinting on a 1.5T MRI-linac"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive review of drug penetration into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (ELF) was previously published in 2011.

The majority of the studies included in this review determined ELF concentrations of antibacterial agents using bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, and this review focuses on intrapulmonary penetration ratios determined with area under the concentration-time curve from healthy human adult studies or pharmacokinetic modeling of various antibacterial agents. If available, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters determined from preclinical murine infection models that evaluated ELF concentrations are also provided. There are also a limited number of recently published investigations of intrapulmonary penetration in critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract infections, where greater variability in ELF concentrations may exist. The significance of these changes may impact the intrapulmonary penetration in the setting of infection, and further studies relating ELF concentrations to clinical response are needed. Phase I drug development programs now include assessment of initial pharmacodynamic target values for pertinent organisms in animal models, followed by evaluation of antibacterial penetration into the human lung to assist in dosage selection for clinical trials in infected patients. The recent focus has been on -lactam agents, including those in combination with -lactamase inhibitors, particularly due to the rise of multidrug-resistant infections. This manifests as a large portion of the review focusing on cephalosporins and carbapenems, with or without -lactamase inhibitors, in both healthy adult subjects and critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Further studies are warranted in critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract infections to evaluate the relationship between intrapulmonary penetration and clinical and microbiological outcomes.

Students realized they could support patients from the sidelines by helping navigate abrupt healthcare changes and proactively addressing needs at home. AIM: To comprehensively identify and meet the clinical and social needs of Atlanta, Georgias patients at highest risk, left without their usual access to healthcare, through proactive telephonic outreach. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Medical and Physicians Assistant students from Emory and Morehouse Schools of Medicine partnered with Grady Health System, Atlantas safety-net hospital. Artificial intelligence prioritized over 15,000 patients by risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In this novel program, students performed telephonic outreach to thousands of patients at highest risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. Students used a custom REDCap form that served as both a call script and data collection tool. It provided step-by-step guidance to (1) screen for COVID-19 and educate on prevention; (2) help patients navigate health system changes to fill gaps in care; and (3) identify and address social needs. Based on patients responses, the form prompted tailored reminders for next steps and connections to medical and social resources. PROGRAM EVALUATION: In the programs first 16 months, students made 7,988 calls, of which 3,354 were answered. Over half (53%) of patients had at least one need requiring action: 48% health and 16% social. DISCUSSION: This proactive, novel initiative identified substantial clinical and social need among patients at highest risk for poor outcomes and filled a pressing health system gap exacerbated by COVID-19. Simultaneously, interprofessional students gained applied exposure to health systems sciences. This program can serve as a model for rapid, cost-effective, high-yield outreach to promote patient health at home both during and beyond the pandemic.

The review found that HIV/AIDS responses to promote mental health, prevent ill-health and treat mental health conditions included diverse interventions at the structural or national, community, household and individual levels. Some of these responses can be easily replicated, others require substantial adaptation, and some can inform development of new innovative offline and online responses to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on mental health of children and adolescents. Programs that mitigate economic impacts including child grants, income generating activities for caregivers, food distribution, health care vouchers, and other economic empowerment interventions can be replicated with minor adjustments. Helplines for vulnerable or abused children and shelters for victims of gender-based violence can be scaled up to respond to the COVID pandemic, with minimal adaptation to adhere to prevention of contagion. Mass media campaigns to combat stigma and discrimination were successfully employed in the HIV response, and similar interventions could be developed and applied in the COVID context.

The activated ILC profile of COVID-19 patients was associated with soluble inflammatory markers, while frequencies of ILC subsets were correlated with laboratory parameters that reflect the disease severity. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the potential role of ILCs in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: This observational prospective study aims to examine the psychological and psychopathological impact of the pandemic stress on patients with pre-existing mood, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Materials and Methods: The study includes 386 consecutive patients recruited from 10 March to 30 June 2020 among those being treated at the Institute of Psychopathology in Rome (Italy) with an age &#8805;18 years and meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (35.2%), bipolar I (BD-I) (21.5%) or II (BD-II) (28.8%) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (7.5%), panic disorder (PD) (7.0%) or social anxiety (SA). A total of 34.2% had lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and 15.3% had alcohol/drug abuse disorders. Using a semi-structured interview, we investigated if the impact of COVID-19 stress for patients has been similar, higher or lower than that of their family and friends and, for patients with relapse/symptoms worsening, if there was a relationship between the clinical condition worsening and the pandemic stress. Results: Compared with that experienced by their family members and friends, the psychological impact of pandemic stress was similar in 52.1% of the sample, better in 37.1% and worse in 10.8%. In 21 patients (5.4%), the stress triggered a recurrence or worsened the symptoms.

About two-third of cases relapse and require second-line treatment, including rituximab, mainly effective in AIHA, and thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in ITP, while the use of splenectomy progressively decreased due to concerns for infectious/thrombotic complications. For those failing second line, immunosuppressants may be considered. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyclosporine treatment in patients with ITP and AIHA. DESIGN: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A (CyA) in ITP (N = 29) and AIHA (N = 10) patients followed at two reference centers in Milan, Italy. METHODS: Responses were classified as partial [Hb > 10 or at least 2 g/dl increase from baseline, platelets (PLT) > 30  10(9)/l with at least doubling from baseline] and complete (Hb > 12 g/dl or PLT > 100  10(9)/l) and evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months. Treatment emergent adverse events were also registered. RESULTS: The median time from diagnosis to CyA was 35 months (3C293), and patients had required a median of 4 (1C8) previous therapy lines. Median duration of CyA was 28 (2C140) months and responses were achieved in 86% of ITP and 50% of AIHA subjects. Responders could reduce or discontinue concomitant treatment and resolved PLT fluctuations on TPO-RA. CyA was generally well tolerated, and only two serious infectious complications in elderly patients on concomitant steroids suggesting caution in this patient population. CONCLUSION: CyA may be advisable in ITP, which is not well controlled under TPO-RA, and in AIHA failing rituximab, particularly if ineligible in clinical trial.","output":"Efficacy and safety of cyclosporine A treatment in autoimmune cytopenias: the experience of two Italian reference centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To develop a new method based on 3D ultrasound information to measure the kyphotic angle (KA) on ultrasound (US) images in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and to evaluate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities and accuracy of the US measurements. METHODS: Twenty subjects with AIS (17F, 3 M, aged 13.7  2.2 years old) were recruited. One 20 + years experienced rater (R3) measured the KA on radiographs twice using the Cobb method. Two raters (R1, R2), both have at least 1-year experience measured US images twice using the new spinous processes method. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[2,1]) of the intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities of US KA measurements were calculated. An equation based on US KA measurements to calculate the radiographic KA was generated. RESULTS: The intra-rater reliability ICC[2,1] (R3) of the X-ray measurement was 0.92 and US KA measurements for R1 and R2 were 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. The inter-rater reliability ICC[2,1] for R1 versus R2 were 0.85 and 0.86, respectively.

When using this equation, the overall MAD between US and radiographic KA was 2.9  1.6. CONCLUSIONS: The ultrasound spinous process method was reliable to measure the KA. Although there was a systematic bias on the US measurements, after the correction, the MAD of the US and radiographic KA was 2.9  1.6.

Emotion classification in the Bengali texts is also gradually being considered as an important task for sports, e-commerce, entertainments, and security applications. However, It is a very critical task to develop an automatic emotion classification system for low-resource languages such as, Bengali. Scarcity of resources and deficiency of benchmark corpora make the task more complicated. Thus, the development of a benchmark corpus is the prerequisite to develop an emotion classifier for Bengali texts. This paper describes the development of an emotional corpus (hereafter called BEmoC) for classifying six emotions in Bengali texts. The corpus development process consists of four key steps: data crawling, pre-processing, labelling, and verification. A total of 7000 texts are labelled into six basic emotion categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust, respectively.

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is a lack of proven effective treatments or cures for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-?3, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities.

MAIN BODY: Some studies showed a lower seroconversion rate in older group patients; thus, we discuss the necessity to reprioritize vaccinations to younger age groups who have better seroconversion rates, but we may face some ethical dilemma that could hinder our hypothesis. Decreased seroconversion rates in adults are attributable to immuno-senescence which involves a decrease in humoral and cellular-mediated immunity with age. Despite this fact, there remains some ethical dilemma that can hinder widespread vaccination of younger generations, the most important of which is the unknown long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines due their fast-tracking under the pressure of the pandemic.

Peripheral whole blood gene expression from 273 subjects with community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or noninfectious illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using microarrays. Sparse logistic regression was used to develop classifiers for bacterial ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of illness (26 probes). Overall accuracy was 87% (238 of 273 concordant with clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than procalcitonin (78%, P < 0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection (78 to 83%). The classifiers developed here externally validated in five publicly available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A sixth publicly available data set included 25 patients with co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens.

Based on the death rate, the lifetime of the coronavirus COVID-19 is predicted as 1464.76 days from February 29, 2020. That is, after March 2024 there will be no death in the USA due to COVID-19 if everyone follows the guidelines of WHO and the advice of healthcare workers. People and government can get prepared for this situation and many lives can be saved. It is the contribution of soft computing. Finally, this article suggests several steps to control the spread and severity of the disease. The research work, the lifetime prediction presented in this article is entirely new and differs from all other articles in the literature.","output":"The prediction of the lifetime of the new coronavirus in the USA using mathematical models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a dramatic challenge for all healthcare systems worldwide. This outbreak immediately affected gastroenterologists as well as global physicians worldwide because COVID-19 can be associated with not only triggering respiratory inflammation but also gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation based on the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via its receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed on GI cells. However, the comorbidity spectrum of digestive system in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. Because the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with immune-based therapies, physicians, and patients have great concern about whether IBD patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worsened disease courses. SUMMARY: It is necessary to precisely ascertain the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the COVID-19 severity in IBD patients and to acknowledge the IBD management during the COVID-19 pandemic with clinically reliable information from COVID-19 cohorts and IBD experts' opinions. In this review, we highlight clinical questions regarding IBD management during the COVID-19 pandemic and make comments corresponding to each question based on recent publications. KEY MESSAGES: We propose that there is (1) no evidence that IBD itself increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) to basically prioritize the control of disease activity of IBD, (3) no need for physicians to suddenly discontinue immunomodulatory or biologic therapy in patients with quiescent IBD, and (4) a need for careful observation of elderly (>60 years old) and IBD patients receiving corticosteroid treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Expert Opinions on the Current Therapeutic Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Japan IBD COVID-19 Taskforce, Intractable Diseases, the Health and Labor Sciences Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a compact pangenome representation based on an optimal segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) Such founder sequences have the feature that each row of the MSA is a recombination of the founders Several linear time dynamic programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder sequences All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder block graph We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels (founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be indexed for efficient string matching We call such graphs segment repeat-free founder block graphs We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder block graph given an MSA The algorithm combines techniques from the founder segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019) We derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the paths of the graph Experiments on an MSA of SARS-CoV-2 strains are reported An MSA of size 410  29811 is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges The maximum length and total length of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively The index on the graph takes only 3% of the size of the MSA ?

Shunt may be intrapulmonary, or extrapulmonary. Handheld devices are increasingly being used for point-of-care ultrasound, but their use to characterize shunt has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: Determine the feasibility of using handheld ultrasound to detect and characterize anatomical substrates of hypoxia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19 suspected to have severe shunt. METHODS: A handheld ultrasound device (iQ, Butterfly, USA) was used to perform lung ultrasound, vascular assessment for DVT, and limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with color Doppler and saline microbubble contrast in patients with COVID-19 suspected to have severe shunt. Images were reassessed by an independent reviewer. RESULTS: After screening 40 patients, six patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified. Two were excluded because palliation had been initiated. So, four patients were studied. Interpretable images were obtained in all cases. Interobserver agreement was good. All patients had abnormal lung ultrasound (lung ultrasound score range 17C22). Identified lung pathology included interstitial syndrome with light beams and small peripheral consolidation (4), lobar consolidation (1), and pleural effusion (1). Abnormal echocardiographic findings included interatrial shunt (2), intrapulmonary shunt (1), and dilated right ventricle with tricuspid valve regurgitation (1). Significant DVT was not detected. CONCLUSION: Use of handheld ultrasound to perform combined lung ultrasound, DVT ultrasound, and limited TTE with color Doppler and saline microbubble contrast is feasible, and may be able to characterize shunt in critically hypoxic patients. Serial studies could be used to monitor changes in shunt. Further studies are required to determine whether this can guide treatment to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory hypoxia.","output":"Feasibility of using a handheld ultrasound device to detect and characterize shunt and deep vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is a major public health challenge threatening the world with the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China.

Pre-pandemic, such changes would have been considered potentially unsafe. This study outlines the impact of lockdown on the incidence and management of ENT emergencies at a large UK centre. METHODS: After modification of pre-pandemic guidelines, ENT emergency referrals data during the UK lockdown were prospectively captured. A comparative analysis was performed with retrospective data from a corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: An overall reduction (p < 0.001) in emergency referrals (n = 119) and admissions (n = 18) occurred during the lockdown period compared to the 2019 period (432 referrals and 290 admissions). Specifically, there were reduced admission rates for epistaxis (p < 0.0001) and tonsillar infection (p < 0.005) in the lockdown period. During lockdown, 90 per cent of patients requiring non-dissolvable nasal packing were managed as out-patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 compelled modifications to pre-pandemic ENT guidelines. The enforced changes to emergency care appear to be safe and successfully adopted.

Our group developed a novel technique to remove the subglottic secretions, the rapid-flow expulsion maneuver (RFEM). The objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of RFEM compared with SSD. METHODS: This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled trial, conducted at Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary hospital. The primary outcome was the incidence of VAP, assessed for non-inferiority. RESULTS: Patients with an endotracheal tube allowing drainage of subglottic secretions (n = 241) were randomly assigned to either the RFEM group (n = 120) or SSD group (n = 121). Eleven patients (9.17%) in the RFEM group and 13 (10.74%) in the SSD group developed VAP (difference, ? 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] [? 9.20 6.03]), as the upper limit of 95% CI was not greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority limit (10%), RFEM was declared non-inferior to SSD. There were no statistically significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality, or ICU length of stay and costs between groups. In terms of safety, no accidental extubation or maneuver-related barotrauma occurred in the RFEM group. The incidence of post-extubation laryngeal edema and reintubation was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: RFEM is effective and safe, with non-inferiority compared to SSD in terms of the incidence of VAP.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the adaptive version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the non-adaptive groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. This method is currently applied to COVID-19 screening in the Clinical Genetic Laboratory at the Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly.

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect patients who are acutely ill with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. OBJECTIVE: To inform these efforts, this paper aims to provide an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semistructured interviews with nurses (5/15, 33%), attending physicians (5/15, 33%), and resident physicians (5/15, 33%) on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine. Semistructured interview protocols and qualitative analysis were framed around the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework, and key themes were identified using a rapid analytic process and consensus approach. RESULTS: All clinical team members reported wide reach of inpatient telemedicine, with some use for almost all patients with COVID-19. Inpatient telemedicine was perceived to be effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) without significantly compromising quality of care. Physician workflows remained relatively stable, as most standard clinical activities were conducted via telemedicine following the initial intake examination, though resident physicians reported reduced educational opportunities given limited opportunities to conduct physical exams. Nurse workflows required significant adaptations to cover nonnursing duties, such as food delivery and facilitating technology connections for patients and physicians alike. Perceived patient impact included consistent care quality, with some considerations around privacy. Reported challenges included patientCclinical team communication and personal connection with the patient, perceptions of patient isolation, ongoing technical challenges, and certain aspects of the physical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical team members reported inpatient telemedicine encounters to be acceptable and effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and PPE use. Nurses adapted their workflows more than physicians in order to implement the new technology and bore a higher burden of in-person care and technical support. Recommendations for improved inpatient telemedicine use include information technology support and training, increased technical functionality, and remote access for the clinical team.","output":"Inpatient Telemedicine Implementation as an Infection Control Response to COVID-19: Qualitative Process Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the continuous reform of the education curriculum, the focus of the curriculum is to provide personal and social needs-related knowledge.

The individuals under study were university health professionals (not doctors) from various autonomous regions within Spain, in both public and private spheres. Sociodemographic and labor-related variables linked to the research and its completion were studied. Likewise, the survey instrument Health Sciences Evidence-Based Practice questionnaire (HS-EBP) was administered to evaluate the barriers to, beliefs in, and attitudes towards evidence-based practice. (3) Results: A total of 716 responses were gathered, of which 387 were collected during the period of confinement, and 343 in the COVID-19 post-confinement period. Possible associations that might help respond to the objectives were explored through a correlational study between the sociodemographic variables and each sub-scale of the HS-EBP 30 questionnaire (n = 716). (4) Conclusions: Barriers to, beliefs in, and attitudes towards evidence-based practice are described. There is a leadership gap where line management provides insufficient motivation to follow work routines. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused immense stress among health professionals. The post-confinement group showed a significant change in the variables 'beliefs and attitudes';, and likewise in the 'evaluation';block, justified by the need to update knowledge and to apply evidence.","output":"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Clinical Application of Evidence-Based Practice in Health Science Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carob pulp has recently received great attention due to its considerable content of polyphenols having a wide range of health promoting effects.

To date, there has been little application of a race, migration and gender lens to explore the long-term health and social consequences of COVID-19 in African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities in Canada, who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. The evidence presented in this commentary suggests that recovery strategies need to adopt an intersectional lens taking into account race, migration and gender since ACB women and ACB immigrant women have been among the populations most impacted both personally and economically. To do so, there is an urgent need to incorporate variables capturing race, beyond visible minority status; gender, beyond looking at differences between women and men; and factors to help understand the complexities of migration trajectories (i.e., beyond the dichotomy of born in Canada versus not born in Canada categories) in Canadian datasets.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of 217 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and 86 sex-matched and age-matched healthy controls without this infection. The patient group was divided into the following two subgroups: the severe (n=93) group and the non-severe (n=124) group. We compared the demographic characteristics, admission complaints, and admission blood parameters of the patient group with those of the control group. We also compared the above-mentioned parameters of the two patient subgroups. Results: The patient group had a significantly lower white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and platelet count (p=0.002, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively) and a significantly higher C-reactive protein level (p<0.001) than the control group did. The leucocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and ferritin level were significantly higher in the severe disease subgroup than those in the nonsevere subgroup (p<0.001). The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) were significantly lower in the severe disease subgroup than those in the non-severe subgroup (p<0.001). We performed a logistic regression analysis and obtained the odds ratios (OR) of several factors. This analysis showed that NLR was positively correlated with the COVID-19 risk (adjusted OR 1.438, p=0.012). However, the association of PLR and LMR with COVID-19 risk remained unclear. Conclusion: The ability to predict prognosis using blood parameters that are routinely assessed at admission can save considerable time and financial resources. We believe that we can predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using the admission NLR levels.

In this study, we investigated the performance of some most popular deep learning architectures including eCNN, U-Net, GAN, V-Net, and Res-Net for the task of sCT generation. As a baseline, an atlas-based method is implemented to which the results of the deep learning-based model are compared. METHODS A dataset consisting of 20 co-registered MR-CT pairs of the male pelvis is applied to assess the different sCT production methods' performance. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics were computed between the estimated sCT and the ground truth (reference) CT images. RESULTS The visual inspection revealed that the sCTs produced by eCNN, V-Net, and ResNet, unlike the other methods, were less noisy and greatly resemble the ground truth CT image. In the whole pelvis region, the eCNN yielded the lowest MAE (26.03  8.85 HU) and ME (0.82  7.06 HU), and the highest PCC metrics were yielded by the eCNN (0.93  0.05) and ResNet (0.91  0.02) methods. The ResNet model had the highest PSNR of 29.38  1.75 among all models. In terms of the Dice similarity coefficient, the eCNN method revealed superior performance in major tissue identification (air, bone, and soft tissue).

A cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online survey between 1 and 12 May 2020. The forward-backward translation method was adopted to translate the FCV-19S into Arabic. The study sample included 725 Jordanian adults. The internal consistency (Cronbachs ) was 0.91 indicating excellent internal consistency. As for convergent validity, a significant positive correlation was found between the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the three subscales of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), with the highest correlation being between the FCV-19S and the anxiety subscale (r = 0.54, p < .05), followed by the stress subscale (r = 0.51, p < .05), and lastly, the depression subscale (r = 0.46, p < .05). Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT). The unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed on the study sample. The Arabic version of the FCV-19S is a reliable and valid instrument with good psychometric properties.

After a slowdown in the epidemic, on 6 May, 2020, the regulatory authorities decided to relax the implemented measures. However, the epidemiological situation soon worsened again. As of 7 February, 2021, a total of 406,352 cases of SARSCov-2 infection have been reported in Serbia, 4,112 deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to better understand the epidemic dynamics and predict possible outcomes, we have developed an adaptive mathematical model SEAIHRDS (S-susceptible, E-exposed, A-asymptomatic, I-infected, H-hospitalized, R-recovered, D-dead due to COVID-19 infection, S-susceptible). The model can be used to simulate various scenarios of the implemented intervention measures and calculate possible epidemic outcomes, including the necessary hospital capacities. Considering promising results regarding the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, the model is extended to simulate vaccination among different population strata. The findings from various simulation scenarios have shown that, with implementation of strict measures of contact reduction, it is possible to control COVID-19 and reduce number of deaths. The findings also show that limiting effective contacts within the most susceptible population strata merits a special attention. However, the findings also show that the disease has a potential to remain in the population for a long time, likely with a seasonal pattern. If a vaccine, with efficacy equal or higher than 65%, becomes available it could help to significantly slow down or completely stop circulation of the virus in human population. The effects of vaccination depend primarily on: 1. Efficacy of available vaccine(s), 2. Prioritization of the population categories for vaccination, and 3. Overall vaccination coverage of the population, assuming that the vaccine(s) develop solid immunity in vaccinated individuals. With expected basic reproduction number of Ro=2.46 and vaccine efficacy of 68%, an 87% coverage would be sufficient to stop the virus circulation.","output":"Simulation and prediction of spread of COVID-19 in The Republic of Serbia by SEIRDS model of disease transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous studies of minority groups in times of emergency have tended to focus on risk reduction or on individual resilience, overlooking the community factors that could be bolstered to promote better health and safety outcomes.

Method: The study included 196 adults age 17C76 years, who filled out on-line questionnaires in May 2020; 112 participants lived in an urban community and 84 lived in a suburban community. Community resilience was evaluated using the Conjoint Community Resiliency Assessment Measure (CCRAM), a validated five-factor multidimensional instrument. Results: Residents of the suburban community reported higher community resilience than residents of the urban community. This difference was related to increased preparedness levels and strength of place attachment in the suburban community. Residents of suburban communities were also more satisfied and confident in health-care services than those of urban communities. Regression analysis showed that the satisfaction with primary health-care services, and not community type, significantly predicted community resilience.

SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA. PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than a year (-1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups.

Several membrane molecules of the host cell must cooperate in this process. While ACE2 serves in a membrane receptor-mediating interaction with the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the virus envelope, enzyme A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) regulates ACE2 availability on the membrane and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitates virus-cell membrane fusion. Interestingly, ACE2, ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 show a daily rhythm of expression in at least some mammalian tissue. The circadian system can also modulate COVID-19 progression via circadian control of the immune system (direct, as well as melatonin-mediated) and blood coagulation. Virus/ACE2 interaction causes ACE2 internalization into the cell, which is associated with suppressed activity of ACE2. As a major role of ACE2 is to form vasodilatory angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin II (Ang II), suppressed ACE2 levels in the lung can contribute to secondary COVID-19 complications caused by up-regulated, pro-inflammatory vasoconstrictor Ang II. This is supported by the positive association of hypertension and negative COVID-19 prognosis although this relationship is dependent on numerous comorbidities. Hypertension treatment with inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system does not negatively influence prognosis of COVID-19 patients. It seems that tissue susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 shows negative correlation to ACE2 expression. However, in lungs of infected patient, a high ACE2 expression is associated with better outcome, compared to low ACE2 expression.

Edible vaccine has no way of forming infection and safety is assured as it only composed of antigenic protein and is devoid of pathogenic genes. Edible vaccines have significant role in stimulating mucosal immunity as they come in contact with digestive tract lining. They are safe, cost-effective, easy-to-administer and have reduced manufacturing cost hence have a dramatic impact on health care in developing countries. EXPERT OPINION: The edible vaccine might be the solution for the potential hazard associated with the parenteral vaccines. In this review we discuss the detailed study of pros, cons, mechanism of immune stimulation, various outbreaks that might be controlled by edible vaccines with the possible future research and applied application of edible vaccine.","output":"A cross talk between the immunization and edible vaccine from natural origin: Current challenges and future prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory infections can occur in pandemics and can spread rapidly within communities resulting in health concerns globally.

In a medically advanced world, where technology is futuristic, but the fact that the virus has still caused deaths of over 3 million people all over the world reportedly and over 180 million affected cases. While the governments of all countries have been trying their best to keep the situation in control, and as the virus continues to evolve and keeps evolving, various countries have been engaged in manufacturing vaccines and have even successfully produced them. The only thing left for us to do, is to, at the least, not catch the virus from other people who are already infected. And the way to do that is to practice social distancing. While it is not something normal people can't do, yet in actuality some don't do, for them it becomes more difficult to maintain such social distance when they are outside, on the streets because not everyone is going to practice social distancing, and it is not doable for them to know if someone is standing at a very close distance. The proposed mobile application is going to target this issue and help the visually impaired to maintain social distancing to keep themselves safe in this pandemic. This application will help resolve the issue for visually impaired people by detecting a person on behalf of them, so that they can become alert and do what is required.

We studied 80 mice in the following groups: male mice (male; n = 6), nonpregnant female control mice (NP-CRL; n = 6), healthy pregnant controls (P-CRL; Con; n = 24), pregnant mice with CP induced by atRA (n = 24), or pregnant mice with CP induced by TCDD (TCDD; n = 20). Pregnant mice were given with atRA (100 mg/kg) or TCDD (40 g/kg), or corn oil by oral gavage at E10.5. The serum samples were collected and eight proteins-including interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-12p70, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and epiregulin-were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Placental tissues were immunostained for IL-12p40 and RAGE from stages E13.5 to E16.5. In P-CRL mice, serum IL-12p40 was significantly increased at E13.5 and declined over E14.5-E16.5. P-CRL had lower IFN- levels at E13.5 compared with NP-CRL. The CP groups showed lower concentrations of IL-12p40 at E13.5-E14.5 and clearly higher concentrations of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) at E13.5 when compared with P-CRL. IL-12p40 immunostaining clearly decreased in placental tissue sections obtained from E13.5 to E14.5 in both CP groups.

However, the issue of online shopping cart abandonment (OSCA) has not been explored extensively in the literature. Grounded by the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, this study explores a sequential mediation model comprising consumers' wait for lower prices as an antecedent, hesitation at checkout and OSCA as mediators, perceived transaction inconvenience as a moderator, and decision to buy from a land-based retailer (DBLR) as an outcome. An online questionnaire was designed and distributed to 883 online consumers in Mainland China. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the survey data. The results show that waiting for lower prices positively influences hesitation at checkout, and subsequently, impacts both OSCA and DBLR. Hesitation at checkout and OSCA play sequential mediating roles in the framework path. In addition, perceived transaction inconvenience strengthens the relationship between waiting for lower prices and hesitation at checkout.

Desensitization in delayed drug reactions has traditionally used slow protocols extending up to several weeks; RDD protocols have been scarcely reported. Patients and Method: We retrospectively analyzed the patients referred to the Allergy Department, who had experienced a delayed DHR (> 6 h) related to a ChD or mAb and underwent an RDD protocol. The rate of successful administration of the offending drug and the presence of adverse reactions were evaluated. Results: A total of 93 RDDs were performed in 11 patients (including 6 men and 5 women, with a median age of 61 years). The primary DHR were maculopapular exanthema (MPE) (8), generalized delayed urticaria (1), MPE with pustulosis and facial edema (1), and facial edema with desquamative eczema (1). The meantime for the onset of symptoms was 3 days (range 1-16 days). RDD was performed using a protocol involving 8-13 steps, with temozolomide (25), bendamustine (4), rituximab (9), infliximab (24), gemcitabine (23), and docetaxel (8), within 4.6-6.5 h. Sixteen breakthrough reactions were reported during the RDD (17.2 %) in 5 patients; all were mild reactions including 11 delayed and 5 immediate reactions. All patients completed their treatment. Conclusions: RDD is a potentially safe and effective procedure in patients suffering from delayed reactions to ChD and mAb.

METHODS: This is a descriptive study conducted to evaluate the performance of contact tracing field teams established by the Ministry of Health to identify, refer, and follow-up persons who tested positive for COVID-19 and their contacts. Reports were collected from various Turkish medical associations, the Turkish Ministry of Health, online news sources, and online interviews published between 11 March 2020 and 18 April 2021. RESULTS: A total of 32 reports published by the Turkish Ministry of Health, various medical associations in Turkey, and the Turkish Academy of Science, together with a number of online media reports on issues involving contact tracing teams, were reviewed. While the activities of the teams were overall found to be of benefit during the pandemic, numerous factors negatively impacting their success were identified. These factors included insufficient social support, wherein the fundamental bioethical values of solidarity, responsibility, respect, and trust were not adopted on a societal level, as well as issues involving the teams themselves, such as lack of time to properly conduct their work, inadequate communication skills and/or personal issues. CONCLUSION: Studies conducted by the contact tracing teams were of vital importance in managing the pandemic. The teams were especially effective in reaching both educated and uneducated segments of the society, in diagnosing cases, and in informing the public regarding the pandemic.

However, the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune response is based also on cellular immunity and there is emerging evidence that anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses can be detected after vaccination also in patients with low antibody levels. In this study we aimed to monitor the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify correlates of reduced protection in frail vaccinated pwMS on different DMTs. MethodsWe designed a long term clinical follow-up of the CovaXiMS (Covid-19 vaccine in Multiple Sclerosis), a prospective multicenter cohort study enrolling pwMS scheduled for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with mRNA vaccines and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after the second vaccine dose. These patients were followed with periodic phone calls up to a mean time of 6 months, and all the SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were registered. The impact of DMTs on cumulative incidence of breakthrough Covid-19 cases was presented by Kaplan-Meier curves. A multivariable logistic model was run to assess factors associated to a higher risk of breakthrough infections. Findings1705 pwMS (81.6% BNT162b2 and 18.4% mRNA-1273) had a full vaccination cycle (2 vaccine doses, 21/28 days apart). Of them, 1509 (88.5%) had blood assessment 4 weeks after the second vaccine dose. During follow-up, 23 breakthrough Covid-19 infections (cumulative incidence: 1.5%, SE=0.3%) were detected after a mean of 108 days after the second dose (range, 18-230). Of them, 9 were on ocrelizumab, one on rituximab, 4 on fingolimod, 6 on dimethyl-fumarate, one on teriflunomide, and 2 were untreated. Just two cases (a woman on ocrelizumab and a man on teriflunomide) required hospitalization. The probability to be infected was associated only with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels measured after 4 weeks from the second vaccine dose (HR=0.63, p=0.007); an antibody level of 660 U/mL was calculated as the cutoff for higher risk of infection. InterpretationOur data show that the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections is mainly associated with reduced levels of the virus-specific humoral immune response.

The loss in the healthcare workforce due to sickness and absence will double the risk of a crisis. Identifying barriers of willingness to work during epidemics outbreak and preparedness of healthcare professionals is important to minimize the shortage of human power. METHODS: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare professionals working in the selected hospitals of Southwest Ethiopia from June 1C30/2020. The data entry was done by Epi-Data Manager version 4.4.1.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a backward stepwise approach was done to identify independent predictors of poor preparedness and willingness of the healthcare professionals to work during COVID-19 and Variables with P-value <0.05 were considered as a statistically significant determinant. RESULTS: Of 407 healthcare professionals who participated in the study, 246 (60.4%) were male. The mean age of the respondents was 28.475.60 years. Forty-seven (11.55%) Physicians, 59 (14.50%) pharmacy personnel, 52 (12.78%) Laboratory personnel, 31 (7.62%) Midwives, and 195 (47.91%) Nurses were included in the study. The healthcare professionals who were not prepared for the provision of services during COVID-19 and not willing to work during COVID-19 were 165 (40.5%) and 86 (21.1%) respectively. Having 6 to10 years experience (AOR=4.046, CI: 1.05C15.58), and divorced marital status (AOR=7.855, CI: 1.781C34.65) were independent predictors of not willing to work during COVID-19. Similarly, lack of personal protective equipment (AOR=28.089, CI: 13.9C56.67) and shortage of infrastructure at the work place (AOR=28.1, CI: 13.9C56.67) were independent predictors of poor preparedness. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Healthcare professionals willingness and preparedness to work during COVID-19 was low. Use of Telemedicine, provision of personal protective equipment, increasing hospitals safety with adequate infection control policy, and assigning staff who have experience of more than ten years in the risky wards of the hospitals may decrease staffs absentee and increase in the provision of continuous service.","output":"Healthcare Professionals Willingness and Preparedness to Work During COVID-19 in Selected Hospitals of Southwest Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral pneumonia is a common complication for patients with hematologic malignancies and after hematopoietic cell transplantation causing significant morbidity, and often mortality.

In this review, the pathogen pyramid framework was utilized to identify the unknown unknowns associated with the emergence and rapid transmission of novel infectious disease agents. Given that the evolutionary origin of most of the emerging infectious disease agents can be traced to an animal source, we argue the need to integrate the One Health approach as a part of surveillance activities. The need for focusing on undertaking global and regional mapping activities to identify novel pathogens is discussed, given that there are an estimated 1.67 million unknown viruses, of which around 631,000 to 827,000 unknown viruses have the capacity to infect human beings. The emerging risks due to the ever-expanding interface between human, animals, both domestic and wildlife, and the environment are highlighted, these are largely driven by the need for safe habitation, growing food, developing infrastructure to support the increasing human population and desire for economic growth. The One Health approach provides a holistic way to address these cross-sectoral issues, by bridging institutional gaps, enumerating priority risk areas and pathogens, and highlighting putative risk factors for subsequent spillover events involving emerging and re-emerging infectious disease pathogens at the human-animal-environment interface.","output":"One Health, Disease X & the challenge of Unknown Unknowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increasing number of higher education institutions have embraced Cloud Computing Services (CCS) to better respond to the issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, it is vital to identify the critical factors affecting the initial and continuance adoption of CCS by students in less developed countries. This study adopts a trade-off lens to assess the impact of the perceived usefulness and perceived risks regarding students' attitudes toward the initial and continuing adoption of CCS. Using a survey of CCS from a large public university in Thailand, we found that performance expectation and effort expectation positively affect perceived usefulness, and that authentication risks positively affect perceived risks.

As a first step towards improving cancer patient care, we explored vaccination rates among patients on active chemotherapy to gain insights on its utilization in this population and improve care of cancer patients. Methods: On 01/23/21, McKesson Specialty Health deployed a COVID Vaccine Administration survey within its iKnowMed electronic health record platform. Cancer patients who answered the survey with ongoing chemotherapy 30 days prior to or after 01/01/21 and 2 office visits between 01/01/21 and 05/27/21 were included in the study. Self-reported and onsite vaccination, brand, and COVID-19Crelated information were recorded. Chi-squared tests were used to determine significant differences between groups. Results: Selection criteria yielded 50,423 patients. The study population was 55% female (n=27,923) with a median age of 68 years (min, max 20, 80+). Approximately 60% (n=11,867) reported initiating vaccination, and 40% (n=7,797) reported being fully vaccinated. The majority of patients reported having received the vaccine by Pfizer (52%, n=10,275), followed by Moderna (45%, n=8,836), Janssen (3%, n=540), and AstraZeneca <1%. Vaccination rates did not differ significantly between females (39%, n=10,799) and males (39%, n=8,865). Patients aged 69 years had a significantly lower rate than those older (34%, n=8,928 vs 44%, n=10,736;p<0.0001). Patients with metastatic disease had a significantly higher vaccination rate than those without metastasis (40%, n=14,591 vs. 36%, n=5,073;p<0.0001).

MethodsIn cooperation with the local health authority, blood samples from fully vaccinated and infected as well as fully vaccinated and uninfected residents of the nursery home were collected four weeks after the onset of the outbreak. The humoral immune response was determined in a neutralisation assay with replication-competent virus isolates and by a quantitative ELISA.

Four residents were unvaccinated, including one with a severe course of disease who later deceased. Despite their old age, all vaccinated residents showed no or only mild disease. Comparison of the humoral immune response revealed significantly higher antibody levels in fully vaccinated infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (p<0.001). Notably, although only a minority of the vaccinated uninfected group showed neutralisation capacity against SARS-CoV-2, all vaccinated and infected individuals showed high-titer neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 including the alpha and beta variant.

Programmes to promote FMS development have been primarily delivered in childcare settings. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of an interactive digital application, designed to be co-used by parent and child, to increase FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moovosity&#8482; programme, a novel digital application to increase FMS proficiency in 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 34 parent-child dyads randomly assigned to either the 8-week intervention (n = 17) or wait-list control (n = 17) condition. FMS proficiency, PA, and parental support for PA was assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Intervention participants were given free access to the app over a period of 8 weeks. Wait-listed controls were given access after the 8-week period. Group differences for pre to post changes in outcomes were tested for significance using general linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction for object control skills (F1,32 = 10.81, P = 0.003). Intervention children exhibited significant improvements in object control skills, while children in the wait-list control group exhibited a modest decline. Intervention children also exhibited improvements in locomotor skills, while wait-listed controls exhibited minimal change; however, the group by time interaction fell outside the 0.05 level of significance (F1,32 = 3.15, P = 0.09).

The potential of siRNA drugs has recently been highlighted by the approval of multiple siRNA therapeutics. These successes relied heavily on chemically modified nucleic acids and their impact on stability, delivery, potency, and off-target effects. Despite remarkable progress, clinical trials still face failure due to off-target effects such as off-target gene dysregulation. Each siRNA strand can downregulate numerous gene targets while also contributing towards saturation of the RNAi machinery, leading to the upregulation of miRNA-repressed genes. Eliminating sense strand uptake effectively reduces off-target gene silencing and helps limit the disruption to endogenous regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, our understanding of strand selection has a direct impact on the success of future siRNA therapeutics. In this review, the approaches used to improve strand uptake are discussed and effective methods are summarized.","output":"Chemical strategies for strand selection in short-interfering RNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report our experience with isobaric transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for the management of large adnexal tumors exceeding 500g of excised tissue weight including cystic contents. STUDY DESIGN In each case, a wound retractor was used to make a working port through a 2.5-cm vertical umbilical incision. The surgical view was secured by the abdominal wall-lift method with an intra-abdominal fan retractor system. After the tumor was punctured by a SAND balloon catheter and the cystic contents were aspirated, surgical procedures were performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments under vision with a rigid 30, 5-mm EndoEYE laparoscope. Clinical data regarding patient demographics and surgical outcomes was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Between October 2010 and April 2012, 35 patients with large adnexal tumors were treated. The median age of the patients was 31.5 years. Previous abdominal surgery was noted in nine cases. The median tumor diameter was 17.7cm. Emergency surgery was performed in two cases of adnexal torsion and one case of tumor rupture. Three cases with intrauterine pregnancy were treated in the late first trimester. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 24 cases. Unilateral cystectomy was performed in five cases. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and contralateral cystectomy, and bilateral cystectomy were performed in two cases each. Unilateral salpingectomy, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and contralateral salpingectomy were performed in one case each. The median excised tissue weight was 1100g. The median surgical duration was 72min, with median blood loss of 10mL Extended hospitalization was required in two cases due to elevated inflammatory parameters, one case with pregnancy due to hyperemesis gravidarum and one case with pregnancy due to subchorionic hematoma. Readmission due to postoperative pelvic abscess was noted in one case and was conservatively managed. Major surgical complications were not experienced. The present technique yielded a minimal postoperative scar concealed within the umbilicus. CONCLUSION The transumbilical wound retraction system combined with an intra-abdominal fan retractor appears to contribute favorably to laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for the management of large adnexal tumors, because the device permits flexible and wide circumferential access by efficient wound retraction during instrumentation without the need for closed condition associated with pneumoperitoneum.","output":"Management of large adnexal tumors by isobaric laparoendoscopic single-site surgery with a wound retractor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the widespread concern but general lack of information over the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in public transport, key issues such as passenger personal hygiene, efficient air circulation systems, and the effective disinfection of frequently touched surfaces need to be evaluated to educate the public and diminish the risk of viral transmission as we learn to live with the ongoing pandemic. In this context we report on a study involving the collection of 99 samples taken from inside Barcelona buses and subway trains in May to July 2020. From this sample group 82 (58 surface swabs, 9 air conditioning (a/c) filters, 3 a/c dust, 12 ambient air) were selected to be analysed by RT-PCR for traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thirty of these selected samples showed evidence for one or more of 3 target RNA gene regions specific for this virus (IP2, IP4, E). Most (24) of these 30 samples showed positivity for only 1 of the 3 RNA targets, 4 samples yielded 2 targets, and 2 samples provided evidence for all 3 targets. RNA remnants were more common in surface swabs from support bars (23 out of 58) than in ambient air inside the vehicles (3 out of 12), with relatively higher concentrations of viral RNA fragments in buses rather than in trains. Whereas subway train a/c filters examined were all virus-free, 4 of the 9 bus a/c filter/dust samples yielded evidence for viral RNA. After nocturnal maintenance and cleaning most buses initially yielding positive results subsequently showed elimination of the RT-PCR signal, although signs of viral RNA remained in 4 of 13 initially positive samples. The presence of such remnant viral traces however does not demonstrate infectivity, which in the present study is considered unlikely given the fragmentary nature of the gene targets detected. Nevertheless, best practice demands that close attention to ventilation systems and regular vehicle disinfection in public transport worldwide need to be rigorously applied to be effective at eliminating traces of the virus throughout the vehicle, especially at times when COVID-19 cases are peaking. Additionally, infectivity tests should be implemented to evaluate the efficiency of disinfection procedures to complement the information resulting from RT-PCR analysis. Modelling the probability of infection whilst travelling in buses under different scenarios indicates that forced ventilation greatly reduces the risk.","output":"Tracing surface and airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA inside public buses and subway trains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread worldwide since early 2020, and it has impacted mobility emissions due to mobility restrictions and e.g. increased remote work.

Understanding the current status of PHE preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals' capacities for emergency response. The objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital PHE preparedness in China. METHODS: Four hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic data; PHE preparation; response to PHE in community; stockpiles of drugs and materials; detection and identification of PHE; procedures for medical treatment; laboratory diagnosis and management; staff training; and risk communication were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 318 (79.5%) of the 400 hospitals surveyed. Of the valid responses, 264 (85.2%) hospitals had emergency plans; 93.3% had command centres and personnel for PHE; 22.9% included community organisations during the training for PHE; 97.4% could transport needed medical staff to a PHE; 53.1% had evaluated stockpiles of drugs; 61.5% had evaluated their supply systems; 55.5% had developed surveillance systems; and 74.6% could monitor the abnormity(See in appendix). Physicians in 80.2% of the analyzed hospitals reported up-to-date knowledge of their institution's PHE protocol. Of the 318 respondents, 97.4% followed strict laboratory regulations, however, only about 33.5% had protocols for suspected samples. Furthermore, only 59.0% could isolate and identify salmonella and staphylococcus and less than 5% could isolate and identify human H5N1 avian flu and SARS. Staff training or drill programs were reported in 94.5% of the institutions; 50.3% periodically assessed the efficacy of staff training; 45% had experts to provide psychological counselling; 12.1% had provided training for their medical staff to assess PHE-related stress. All of the above capacities related to the demographic characteristics of hospitals and will be discussed in-depth in this paper. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggested that, at the time of the survey, hospital preparedness for PHE in China was at an early stage of development.

However, in practice, the yield of the extraction process and the inhibition of the reverse transcription reaction and PCR by foreign substances reduce the sensitivity and may yield false negative results. The sensitivity of the PCR test can be improved by using technologies that can reliably capture the target nucleic acid and remove foreign substances. In this study, we developed photo-cross-linkable probe-modified magnetic particles (PPMPs) for the sequence-specific recovery of target nucleic acids using photo-cross-linkable artificial nucleic acid probes and magnetic particles. Nucleic acid probes modified with photo-cross-linkable artificial nucleic acids can hybridize with the target nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner and then securely capture the target nucleic acids by UV irradiation-mediated covalent bonding. Then the target nucleic acid is detected by trapping the target-bound probe on the surface of the magnetic particles and subjecting these collected magnetic particles to PCR. Recovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) N gene pseudo-DNA (120 bp) was performed using PPMPs. We confirmed that the PPMPs captured the target consistently even after washes were done with denaturing agents and surfactants. Even in the presence of foreign DNA fragments, PPMPs were able to specifically recover the target DNA. This method allows for a more accurate detection by recovering only the target DNA for PCR. Hence, PPMPs can be successfully used for PCR-mediated detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens whose nucleic acid sequences are known.","output":"Photo-Cross-Linked Probe-Modified Magnetic Particles for the Selective and Reliable Recovery of Nucleic Acids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the novel SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect numerous individuals worldwide, one of the leading approaches in dealing with the global health crisis is vaccination against the COVID-19. Due to recent reports, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca) may result in a vaccine-induced catastrophic thrombotic thrombocytopenia disorder. Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcRIIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon.

The newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and reemerging influenza virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model.

Cell Biol. 116:57- 67) that a COOH-terminally truncated variant of ribophorin I that contains only the first 332 amino acids of the luminal domain (RI332), when synthesized in permanent transformants of HeLa cells, undergoes a rapid degradation with biphasic kinetics in the ER itself and in a second, as yet unidentified nonlysosomal pre-Golgi compartment. We now show that in cells treated with brefeldin A (BFA) RI332 molecules undergo rapid O-glycosylation in a multistep process that involves the sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and terminal sialic acid residues. Addition of O-linked sugars affected all newly synthesized RI332 molecules and was completed soon after synthesis with a half time of about 10 min. In the same cells, intact ribophorins I and II also underwent O-linked glycosylation in the presence of BFA, but these molecules were modified only during a short time period immediately after their synthesis was completed, and the modification affected only a fraction of the newly synthesized polypeptides. More important, these molecules synthesized before the addition of BFA were not modified by O-glycosylation. The same is true for ribophorin I when overexpressed in HeLa cells although it is significantly less stable than the native polypeptide in control cells. We, therefore, conclude that soon after their synthesis, ribophorins lose their susceptibility to the relocated Golgi enzymes that effect the O-glycosylation, most likely as a consequence of a conformational change in the ribophorins that occurs during their maturation, although it cannot be excluded that rapid integration of these molecules into a supramolecular complex in the ER membrane leads to their inaccessibility to these enzymes.","output":"O-glycosylation of intact and truncated ribophorins in brefeldin A- treated cells: newly synthesized intact ribophorins are only transiently accessible to the relocated glycosyltransferases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus pandemic continues to spread causing further public health, social, and economic issues.

DESIGN: Qualitative indepth interview study. SETTING: The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 53 healthcare workers who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were initially not sufficiently psychologically prepared. Then they suffered from severe anxiety and apprehension during the peak stage, regardless of whether they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. These negative emotions were exacerbated by four drivers, namely infection risk, supplies, isolation and media. As the epidemic gradually came under control, healthcare workers experienced less anxiety from these factors, but became concerned about their low financial status. To reduce anxiety, healthcare workers diverted their attention from the risk of infection through personal entertainment and religious beliefs and focused on treating their patients. Furthermore, assistance from other people, including colleagues, families, friends, patients and society, helped protect healthcare workers from anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Personal and social support can relieve healthcare workers' anxiety to some extent during the different stages of an epidemic. Both protective equipment and financial allowance motivate healthcare workers to focus on patient care, although the latter matters more as the epidemic comes under control.","output":"Drivers and mediators of healthcare workers' anxiety in one of the most affected hospitals by COVID-19: a qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this article is to study systematically current evidence on status of arthroscopic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to study (1) changes in global arthroscopic practices, (2) recommendations on reducing risk to patients and health care workers (HCW), (3) changes in follow-up protocols of these patients. Systematic search was carried out by two different reviewers using three different online databases for all studies published in the English language before April 2020. The total number of abstracts screened initially was 314. After screening of these abstracts, a total of 13 studies were included for the systematic review. Numbers of orthopaedic injuries have seen a sharp fall during this time. Most elective surgical facilities were also closed at this time. Most studies have recommended telemedicine as an essential medium of providing continued care to patients during COVID-19. Studies have recommended that a conservative approach should be preferred for most patients with ligament injuries, and alternative procedures that have less requirement for an operating room should be explored. Common recommendation in all studies is that procedures of more elective nature should be postponed to a safer time frame when the transmission of COVID-19 virus in the population has declined. When surgeries are resumed, there is a need for triage of arthroscopy procedures from more important or urgent to less important ones. Elective surgical procedures should preferably be started with patients with no co-morbidities and lesser risk of peri-operative complications. All patients undergoing surgery and health care personnels should have some screening for disease. Attempts should be made to have shortest hospital stay. Choice of anaesthetic procedure should emphasize on minimal aerosolization of the virus. Regional anaesthesia is the preferred choice as far as possible.

Motivated by the linguistic relativity hypothesis, we take language as a proxy for cultural origins and exploit the exogenous variation in the language spoken around the border that divides the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland to estimate the impact of culture on exposure to COVID-19. The results obtained using a spatial regression discontinuity design reveal, that within 50- and 25-kilometers bandwidth from the language border, the average COVID-19 exposure levels for individuals in French speaking municipalities was higher.

Effective care and therapy are currently being evaluated in full swing. PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate the effects of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, on treatment of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA EXTRACTION: We conducted a meta-analysis and searched for relevant studies on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library without restrictions on language from inception until February 1, 2021. Fifteen studies were included for this meta-analysis. Two authors independently selected and screened these studies, assessed the quality of included studies, and extracted related information. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The main studies showed that tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality (risk ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.46C0.83; and hazard ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence interval = 0.51C0.72). Using tocilizumab might also affect biochemistry indicators (lowered C-reactive protein and ferritin, increased lymphocyte count). CONCLUSION: These current bodies of evidence could indicate that early use of tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. Early use of tocilizumab could reduce the mortality rate of adult patients with COVID-19 without obvious fatal side effects, which may be a treatment option in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS The convenience sampling method was applied to select 422 medical workers who kept touch with the bereaved family members in five COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan from January to February 2020. Questionnaire regarding grief counseling attitudes and questionnaire regarding grief counseling skills were used to evaluate the attitudes and skills of grief counseling in medical workers. The scores of grief counseling attitudes and skills in group of different characteristics were further compared. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the attitudes and skills of grief counseling in medical workers. RESULTS The scores of grief counseling attitudes in medical workers were 15-46 (33.009.31). Length of service, professional title, whether or not receiving relevant training, frequency of contact with bereaved family members contributed to impacting the medical workers' attitudes of grief counseling (all P<0.05). The scores of grief counseling skills in medical workers were 9-30 (19.304.42).

Over the last 40 years, its support has been unwavering, and in the Covid-19 crisis, it once again turned to loan guarantees as a means of supporting smaller firms through the crisis-induced slump in trading activities. Of its three core Covid-19 guarantee schemes, the Bounce Back Loan (BBL) scheme was the most numerous with 1,531,095 loans issued amounting to a total of 46.5bn in lending. The BBL scheme provided a 100% capital guarantee on loans between 2,000 and 50,000, and firms were allowed to borrow up to 25% of their trading income, with a fixed interest rate of 2.5% of which the first years interest was paid by the government to the lending bank. Our findings suggest that the government losses may range between 7bn and 12bn depending on the underlying assumptions;however, we estimate Covid-19 guarantee schemes may have protected 118,639 businesses and 1,117,849 jobs. Looking to the future, we suggest that a new loan guarantee is justified that more resembles the former SFLG than the restrictive Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) as more than one million small businesses will be heavily indebted and unable to borrow to invest in future growth opportunities.

METHODS: From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 total n-5,111 numbers of HCV real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were performed in Gujrat. For extinction analysis we used 2 different models, the first model was seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and the second linear regression (LR) model. First, we fitted both models then these fitted and valid models were used to predict future HCV percentage in District Gujrat. RESULTS: In District Gujrat, the men HCV infected ratio is high with a higher viral load as compared with women, from year 2016 to 2020 male to female ratio was (53.75:53.19), (45.67:43.84), (39.67:39.36), (41.94:35.88), (37.70:31.38) respectively.

Automatic and accurate COVID-19 detection/evaluation from the computed tomography (CT) scans is of great significance for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. Due to individual variations of patients and the influx of a large number of patients, the current clinical practices remain subject to shortcomings of potential high-risk and time-consumption issues from radiologists. In this paper, we propose a computer aided detection system to relieve the clinical physicians from tediously reading the CT images of COVID-19 patients. Particularly, a COVID-19 detection network (COVIDNet) is proposed using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for patient-level COVID-19 detection to distinguish infected and non-infected patients. The underlying method complementarily and comprehensively extract multi-level interplane volumetric correlation features of typical ground glass opacities (GGOs) lesions using 3D multi-Scale Network (MSN). To cover more GGO lesion features and reduce intra-class differences, a Phase Ensemble (PE) is proposed for aggregation of different phases in one CT scan. The proposed method is evaluated on a clinically established COVID-19 database with five-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves classification performance with the specificity of 1.0000, sensitivity of 0.9700, accuracy of 0.9850, precision of 1.0000, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9980.

The introduction of different targeted agents closely followed the increase in knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms. The identification of IL-23 as a master regulator of pathogenic inflammation and the consequent efficacy of IL-23 blocking agents were first proofed in psoriasis and then in other inflammatory diseases such as psoriatic arthritis and Crohns disease. METHODS: We reviewed all available results from anti-Il-23 clinical trials for psoriasis, focusing on data of IBDologists interest. Regarding guselkumab, we analysed data from phase III clinical trials VOYAGE1, VOYAGE2, and NAVIGATE. For risankizumab, we reported efficacy and safety results from UltIMMa-1, UltIMMa-2, and IMMvent clinical trials, and tildrakizumab was evaluated by analysing data from reSURFACE1 and reSURFACE2 studies. RESULTS: Data from all the clinical trials that we reported showed both the efficacy of all three anti-IL-23 drugs in psoriasis and the safety of this class; in particular, no gastrointestinal side effects were observed in those studies. IL-23 blockers have shown promising short- and long-term results in psoriasis, with a major safety profile and no negative interactions with gastrointestinal system. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-IL-23 indication for psoriatic arthritis is very recent and for IBD is still to come.

We hypothesized that clinical prognosis tools could be derived from objectively measured COVID-19 cough time patterns to rapidly identify patients at high risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes. Methods: Between December 2020 and June 2021, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled at University of Florida Health Shands (n=98) and the Centre Hospitalier de lUniversit de Montral (n=25). Patients cough was continuously monitored digitally along with clinical severity of disease until hospital discharge, intubation, or death. The natural history of cough in severe COVID-19 disease was described and logistic models fitted on cough time patterns were used to predict clinical outcomes. Findings: In both cohorts, higher coughing rates were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes. The transitional cough rate, or maximum cough rate per hour predicting unfavorable outcomes, was 340 and the AUC for cough frequency as a predictor of unfavorable outcomes was 0761. The initial 6h (0792) and 24h (0719) post-enrolment observation periods showed similar predictive value. Interpretation: Digital cough monitoring could be used as a prognosis biomarker to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in COVID-19 disease. With early sampling periods showing good predictive value, this digital biomarker could be combined with clinical and paraclinical evaluation and is well adapted for triaging patients in overwhelmed or resources-limited health programs.

The protease exhibits a typical chymotrypsin fold with a Cys...His...Glu catalytic triad; its three-dimensional structure is closely related to that of the 3C(pro) of rhinovirus 2, as well as to that of poliovirus. The phylogenetic position of the EV68 3C(pro) between the corresponding enzymes of rhinoviruses on the one hand and classical enteroviruses on the other prompted us to use the crystal structure for the design of irreversible inhibitors, with the goal of discovering broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. We synthesized a series of peptidic ,-unsaturated ethyl esters of increasing length and for each inhibitor candidate, we determined a crystal structure of its complex with the EV68 3C(pro), which served as the basis for the next design round. To exhibit inhibitory activity, compounds must span at least P3 to P1'; the most potent inhibitors comprise P4 to P1'. Inhibitory activities were found against the purified 3C protease of EV68, as well as with replicons for poliovirus and EV71 (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.5 M for the best compound). Antiviral activities were determined using cell cultures infected with EV71, poliovirus, echovirus 11, and various rhinovirus serotypes. The most potent inhibitor, SG85, exhibited activity with EC(50)s of 180 nM against EV71 and 60 nM against human rhinovirus 14 in a live virus-cell-based assay. Even the shorter SG75, spanning only P3 to P1', displayed significant activity (EC(50) = 2 to 5 M) against various rhinoviruses.","output":"3C protease of enterovirus 68: structure-based design of Michael acceptor inhibitors and their broad-spectrum antiviral effects against picornaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammation syndrome. In adults, secondary HLH is mostly observed. HLH is often triggered by infections, malignancies or autoimmune disorders. However, HLH cases in association with immunotherapies have been described recently. HLH in critically ill patients is often difficult to differentiate from sepsis. Both conditions can also be present at the same time. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of an adequate immunosuppressive therapy are essential for the further course and the prognosis of HLH. Therefore, HLH should represent a differential diagnosis in critically ill patients with persistent fever and additional symptoms (e.g. enlarged spleen, neurologic symptoms) or laboratory parameters (e.g. hyperferritinemia, cytopenia, increased transaminases) compatible with HLH. The diagnosis of HLH is made using the HLH-2004 criteria. The probability of the presence of HLH can be calculated using the HScore. High-dose corticosteroids represent the cornerstone of HLH treatment. Etoposide, immunoglobulins, anakinra or other drugs are added depending on the trigger. The course of HLH is influenced by the time of treatment initiation, the underlying trigger and the response to treatment. Generally, the prognosis of critically ill HLH patients is poor.","output":"Die h?mophagozytische Lymphohistiozytose bei kritisch kranken Patienten"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis is the aetiological agent of swine paratyphoid being a highly invasive zoonotic pathogen. Wild boar natural populations are experiencing a demographical expansion as well as some farms are breeding this species to release for hunting with management sometimes identical to that of domestic pigs, including supplementation, grouping, and antibiotic treatments. This situation increases the chance of contact between wild boars and livestock, and potentially induces stress, with different sanitary consequences. The present work aims to describe the clinical features of recent outbreaks caused by S. Choleraesuis in wild boar from central\\\\western Spain, as well as the antimicrobial resistance and phylogenetic relationships of isolates involved. 28 strains of S. Choleraesuis were isolated from 28 different wild boars belonging to 10 different game states located in central western Spain and submitted to the Clinical Veterinary Hospital (CVH) of the University of Extremadura. Samples were taken from different organs and cultured according to the ISO 6579:2002 procedure. Suspicious colonies were identified by PCR and antimicrobial resistance was evaluated by disc diffusion susceptibility test and the presence of the main resistance genes as well as 18 plasmid replicons frequently found among the Enterobacteriaceae was verified by PCR. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was applied to determine the genetic relationship between isolates. The outbreaks under study were characterized by high mortality (35%C84%) and a septicaemic presentation. S. Choleraesuis was isolated from all the wild boars analysed, and 26 of the 28 isolates presented resistance to at least one antibiotic. The predominant resistances found were against sulphonamide, streptomycin, tetracycline, and doxicicline and sul1, strA\\\\strB, and tetA were the most prevalent resistance genes among isolates. 10 strains carried FIIA, FIB+H/1 or FIIA+H/1 plasmids. PFGE classified the isolates into four different profiles, grouped into two clusters. This results show that prevention against S.

Besides, existing pandemic metrics are sensitive to the detecting policy ( p <0.001), which make them hard to reveal the real infection phenomena, because the fluctuation of these metric values may be an outcome of a suddenly changed detecting policy instead of real infection increase or decrease. Methods: We developed a Benchmark, Amendment and Validation model (BAVM) to make the above complex phenomena clearer, and combined with the hypothesis of potential periodicity of COVID-19 to devote jointly the retreated prediction of pandemic within a broad time-window. Onward, we utilized 113 countries epidemic data from January 21, 2020 to August 31, 2020 and detecting policies to carry out our methodology, then validated the results through statistical tests involving chi -square test, one t-test and independent t test. Results: Results exhibit the 4-month of potential periodicity between two adjacent peaks of pandemic ( t =C1.56, p =12.4%). Besides, whether or not the peak emergence has no effect on COVID-19 dynamic trajectory, but the time to firstly peak affects. Meanwhile, uprising the quarantine rate exhibits the earlier expedition towards the first peak emergence (9.7% vs. 6.2%, p =4.1%).

The model makes use of a unique quarterly data set of coal, natural gas, and oil consumption, output, exchange rates and equity prices, including global fossil fuel prices for 32 major CO2 emitting countries in 1984-2019.

We also simulate the effect of a relative price change in fossil fuels, due to global scale carbon pricing, on consumption and output. Our results predict fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to return to their pre-crisis levels, and even exceed them, within the two-year horizon despite the large reductions in the first quarter following the outbreak. Our forecasts anticipate more robust growth for emerging than for advanced economies. The model predicts recovery to the pre-crisis levels even if another wave of pandemic occurs within a year.

This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fishers exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; p = 0.004; 82% vs 61%; p = 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; p = 0.03; 77% vs 54%; p = 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; p = 0.01; 25% vs 6%; p  0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; p = 0.01; 35% vs 65%; p = 0.02, respectively).

The incidence of reverse triggering is unknown. This study aimed at determining the incidence of reverse triggering in critically ill patients under controlled ventilation. METHODS In this ancillary study, patients were continuously monitored with a catheter measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm. A method for automatic detection of reverse triggering using electrical activity of the diaphragm was developed in a derivation sample and validated in a subsequent sample. The authors assessed the predictive value of the software. In 39 recently intubated patients under assist-control ventilation, a 1-h recording obtained 24 h after intubation was used to determine the primary outcome of the study. The authors also compared patients' demographics, sedation depth, ventilation settings, and time to transition to assisted ventilation or extubation according to the median rate of reverse triggering. RESULTS The positive and negative predictive value of the software for detecting reverse triggering were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98). Using a threshold of 1 V of electrical activity to define diaphragm activation, median reverse triggering rate was 8% (range, 0.1 to 75), with 44% (17 of 39) of patients having greater than or equal to 10% of breaths with reverse triggering. Using a threshold of 3 V, 26% (10 of 39) of patients had greater than or equal to 10% reverse triggering. Patients with more reverse triggering were more likely to progress to an assisted mode or extubation within the following 24 h (12 of 39 [68%]) vs. 7 of 20 [35%]; P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS Reverse triggering detection based on electrical activity of the diaphragm suggests that this asynchrony is highly prevalent at 24 h after intubation under assist-control ventilation.

METHODS: In this study, we performed an online survey to evaluate the psychological effects of quarantine using the Zung Self\\\\rating Anxiety Scale in February 2020 when the outbreak had nearly peaked in China. Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information, such as age, gender, region, education, occupation, and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine, was collected for analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 992 valid questionnaires from 23 provinces in China, clinically significant anxiety symptoms were observed in 9.58% of respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. The specific groups of people showing higher levels of anxiety were (a) adolescents (<18 years); (b) respondents with education lower than junior high school; (c) people with chronic diseases; and (d) frontline medical personnel. Other characteristics, such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID\\\\19, did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents who experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. People undergoing centralized quarantine have higher levels of anxiety.

We address whether, compared to other foods, does consumption of SSB (1) automatically lead to failure to compensate for the energy it contains? (2) fail to elicit homeostatic hormone responses? (3) promote hedonic eating through activation of the brains reward pathways? We followed the evidence to address: (4) Would restriction of targeted marketing of SSB and other unhealthy foods to vulnerable populations decrease their prevalence of obesity? RECENT FINDINGS: The data are lacking to demonstrate that SSB consumption promotes body weight gain compared with isocaloric consumption of other beverages or foods and that this is linked to its failure to elicit adequate homeostatic hormone responses. However, more recent data have linked body weight gain to reward activation in the brain to palatable food cues and suggest that sweet tastes and SSB consumption heightens the reward response to food cues. Studies investigating the specificity of these responses have not been conducted. Nevertheless, the current data provide a biological basis to the body of evidence demonstrating that the targeted marketing (real life palatable food cues) of SSB and other unhealthy foods to vulnerable populations, including children and people of color and low socioeconomic status, is increasing their risk for obesity. SUMMARY: While the mechanisms for the association between SSB consumption and body weight gain cannot be identified, current scientific evidence strongly suggests that proactive environmental measures to reduce exposure to palatable food cues in the form of targeting marketing will decrease the risk of obesity in vulnerable populations.","output":"An Exploration of the Role of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage in Promoting Obesity and Health Disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leadership and management skills are critical for health programs to deliver high-quality interventions in complex systems.

Comorbid cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia, elevated CRP, liver enzyme and D-dimer levels, and higher chest CT score were significantly associated with an increase in oxygen requirement CONCLUSIONS: The expanded CURB-65 score can be a better predictor of an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","output":"Prediction of an increase in oxygen requirement of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia using three different scoring systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With a recent focus on minimizing the visibility of scars, minilaparoscopy has reemerged as an attractive option for surgeons.

This complex selectively trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27. EZH2 is strongly upregulated in septic patients. EZH2 blockage suppresses the activation of inflammatory cells and release of cytokines in circulation and infections sites, replenishes circulating neutrophil and monocyte pools from the bone marrow, and suppresses the progression of lung injury. Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the expression levels of EZH2, CT lung findings, and treatment outcomes in adult newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and COVID-19 disease. Materials and Methods: The present study included 5 de novo AML cases. The following was performed for all patients: complete blood count, bone marrow examination, cytochemical and immunophenotyping studies, and conventional cytogenetic, hepatic, and renal function tests. Detection of EZH2 expression level was achieved by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). COVID-19 diagnosis was based on lung CT and VIASURE SARS-CoV Real-Time PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs (CerTestBiotec, Spain). Results: The median age of our patients was 35 years (60%);3 patients were male. (40%), and 2 patients were female (60%). Three patients were M5. Cytogenetic studies revealed presence of normal cytogenetics in (60%) 3 patients. One case had intermediate/severe disease, while 4 cases were ICU admitted and later died. Lung CT changes were present in all cases. Unexpectedly, EZH2 expression was lower in patients with CT findings consistent with micronodule infiltration and consolidation (2 patients) than patients with ground glass appearance (3 patients). This means that lower EZH2 levels are present in patients with a higher degree of lung injury or perhaps presence of other coexisting infections modifying the results.

Fisher's exact and Spearman's rank correlation tests were used for analysis. Propensity score matching adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Results 687 participants were eligible for analysis (NDBO n=306, DBO n=49, GORD n=132, colonic polyps n=152 and healthy n=48). 53% of NDBO participants reported similarly high cancer worry, comparable to DBO (50%, p=0.933) and colonic polyp participants (51%, p=0.355). Less cancer worry was reported in GORD participants (43.4%, p=0.01 vs NDBO).

Stimulus preference assessments (SPA) are a frequently used method to identify putative reinforcers. Given the fluctuating nature of individual preferences, there is need for efficient training of providers that may regularly implement SPAs. The present study evaluated the utility of a web-delivered training with virtual role play to train SPA implementation. This study builds upon previous literature by utilizing a larger sample and incorporating role-play, a component often omitted from other efficient methods of training. Study 1 trained 40 undergraduate students to implement an SPA via web or in vivo. Results suggest both trainings were equivalently effective, and the web-delivered training reduced trainer time by approximately 25 min. Live role-play and feedback was still necessary with web-delivered training, consistent with suggestions that rehearsal and feedback is a vital component of training. Results also suggest web-delivered training may identify areas of weakness following training. A follow-up clinical pilot showed that the web-delivered training was also effective at training eight novice providers to competently implement the SPA with children with ASD in a special education school. This study demonstrates that web-delivered training with virtual role-play is likely another efficient training method for implementation of behavioral procedures.","output":"Use of an Online Training with Virtual Role Play to Teach Preference Assessment Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We evaluated the results of mediastinoscopy-assisted esophagectomy (MAE), performed for esophageal cancer patients with comorbidities, versus those of thoracoscopic esophagectomy (TSE), performed for esophageal patients with or without comorbidities. METHODS Among 153 patients who underwent esophageal cancer surgery at our hospital, 17 (11.1%) underwent MAE and 37 (24.2%) underwent TSE. RESULTS Many of the MAE group patients had pulmonary (P < 0.001), cardiovascular (P = 0.031), or hepatic (P = 0.0029) diseases preoperatively, and these comorbidities frequently overlapped (P < 0.0001). The %VC and FEV(1)/FVC were lower (P = 0.0099 and P = 0.0057, respectively), and the ICG-R15 and serum level of HbA1c were higher (P = 0.0014 and P = 0.043, respectively) in the MAE group. There were no differences in postoperative complications or in the modified Clavien classification between the groups. There was no mortality in either group. After MAE, 5 (29.4%) patients died of other diseases. The 5-year overall survival rate after MAE was poorer than that after TSE (56.1 vs. 71.8%), but the 5-year cause-specific survival rates were similar in the two groups.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their extended healthspans are poorly understood. To address this question we carried out an eight-year longitudinal study of ageing in long-lived bats (Myotis myotis). We deep-sequenced ~1.7 trillion base pairs of RNA from 150 blood samples collected from known aged bats to ascertain the age-related transcriptomic shifts and potential microRNA-directed regulation that occurred. We also compared ageing transcriptomic profiles between bats and other mammals by analysis of 298 longitudinal RNA sequencing datasets. Bats did not show the same transcriptomic changes with age as commonly observed in humans and other mammals, but rather exhibited a unique, age-related gene expression pattern associated with DNA repair, autophagy, immunity and tumour suppression that may drive their extended healthspans. We show that bats have naturally evolved transcriptomic signatures that are known to extend lifespan in model organisms, and identify novel genes not yet implicated in healthy ageing. We further show that bats' longevity profiles are partially regulated by microRNA, thus providing novel regulatory targets and pathways for future ageing intervention studies. These results further disentangle the ageing process by highlighting which ageing pathways contribute most to healthy ageing in mammals.","output":"Longitudinal comparative transcriptomics reveals unique mechanisms underlying extended healthspan in bats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unanticipated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit global business heavily, disrupting the management of human resources across numerous industries More than 500 articles (indexed in Scopus and the Web of Science) on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on emerging human resources issues and related practices were published from 1 January 2020 to 31 January 2021 In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review on emerging studies in the business and management field to explore what the emerging human resource issues are during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose related practices to solve these issues The analysis of the published literature identifies nine main human resource issues across 13 industries The findings of this study suggest that COVID-19 has enormous impact on conventional human resource management and requires the theoretical and empirical attention of researchers The propositions nominate related human resource practices to deal with emerging human resources issues and identify several research venues for future studies in this field","output":"Risk Management: Exploring Emerging Human Resource Issues during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe aim of this project was to implement the new pathway Transforming the care of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the secondary care Gastroenterology Clinic with a view to reducing the number of patients requiring medical review, meet waiting time targets and promote supported self-managementNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver pathology, strongly associated with obesity and diabetes. Lifestyle change aimed at weight loss through diet and physical activity is the mainstay of clinical management guidelines for NAFLD (NICE 2016). Only 34% of people link being overweight to liver disease (versus over 80% understanding the link between ex cess weight and heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes).Evidence highlights just providing NAFLD patients with information and advice to change behaviour is an insufficient intervention. Readiness to change weight-related behaviours (both physical activity and eating habits) is often low and not associated with severity of liver disease. Being diagnosed with NAFLD is insufficient to propel people into the preparation/action stage of change. This is not surprising given that NAFLD is often asymptomatic. Patients do not see their condition. (Stewart et al 2014).A multi-disciplinary approach promoting supported self-management is recommended. A review by Taylor et al (2014) stated that all healthcare organisations should be providing self-management as an integral component of care.MethodsLocal health intelligence data was reviewed to justify rationale for establishing a new pathway for patients with NAFLD. According to health intelligence figures, 862 patients were admitted to hospital with NAFLD and NASH as either their main reason for admission or a secondary reason during a 12 month period (1st October 2018 - 30 September 2019).Prior to the new pathway the majority of patients with abnormal Liver Function Test (LFT) were referred to hospital and saw medical staff at their first appointment. Due to the volume of patients this led to a long waiting list to be seen. GPs were unsure when to refer patients and which bloods/investigations should be performed beforehand. There was no dedicated input from Health Psychology or Diabetes Specialists.The Lead Clinician and Lead Hepatology Nurse Specialist led on development of a new pathway. They agreed input and way forward for a multidisciplinary approach with General Practitioners, dietetic and psychology departments. It was agreed GPs would perform chronic liver disease screen, ultrasound and FIB4. If ultrasound suggested NAFLD patients would be referred to the new multi-disciplinary clinic. Each patient was seen by a Liver Nurse for a fibroscan and if required they also saw a Consultant in the same clinic. All appropriate patients were referred for psychology assessment in the same clinic slot. Dietetic support was available asynchronously.Following the initial clinic appointment all review appointments were offered by psychology (4-8 review virtual review appointments).Repeat bloods were done at blood hubs set up locally. Patients were only brought back into clinic if they required more tests, a repeat fibroscan and for 6 month review.Over a 15 month period 101 patients received a brief low intensity psychology intervention. Participants were encouraged to change their health behaviour. Each participant was seen for an assessment (and up to 8 weekly follow-up consultations via email, telephone or video call). Each patient was reviewed by the Health Psychologist at three and six months. At each contact participants were asked to complete A Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs) fourteen item scale (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a person is experiencing.Each participant was provided with a Fitbit Inspire fitness tracker at their baseline appointment and were asked to record and report back their seven day average step count to the Health Psychologist. A goal setting booklet and four week walking plan was provided to assist with this.Results101 patients, (53% Males and 47% Females) agreed to participate. The BMI of patients assessed was 40.1 (113.5kg). Almost all patients were not meeting guidelines of 150mins of physical activity per week. Baseline step count was 1635. The majority presented with two or more long term conditions alongside NAFLD. Most common being Type 2 Diabetes (44%) and anxiety/depression (27%). Average Fib 4 score was 1.4, KPa 14.4. HbA1c 58.8, Cholesterol 5.0, ALT 81.4, AST 58.4.91% of patients were followed up (9% drop out). Average weight loss 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). 82% increased daily step count (1635 to 5958). Anxiety scores (HADs) decreased from (7.4 to 6) and Depression scores reduced 6.3 to 3.3.Due to Covid 19 restrictions we dont have repeat measures on medical markers for all patients. However some case studies are encouraging.At the end of their 6 month follow-up appointment, participants were asked to provide free text qualitative feedback on their thoughts about the new pathway and multi-disciplinary approach.Questions asked included What happened?, How did you feel?, What was good? and What could be improved?Comments received includedGreat service Kept in touch- keeps your mind on itFound the health psychology input helpful. Having someone to talk to who was interested in me cheered me up Really useful to have someone to report back to in terms of achieving weight loss goals Extremely helpful in terms of explaining why weight loss was so importantThink it is really helped having someone who is supportive and willing to listen is a big help. You dont feel youre achieving anything if youve got nobody to bounce it off.I feel more confident that I can make changesFirst Class Service C, I feel a lot more positiveThe support I received at the NAFLD clinic was useful, it was good to talk about weight and why it was important to change things. Made me realise I needed to start making changes for myself and my family. We have all lost weightFelt supported from the team. Telephone support really worked for me. Made me feel good and realise the progress I had madeConclusionsThe results have identified that patients who attended the multi-disciplinary clinic made substantial improvements to their lifestyle. Average daily step count increased over the 6 month period, from 1635 to 5958. 82% patients reported an increase in activity levels;27% patients had been shielding but reported doing home based exercise programmes. Average self-reported weight loss at 6 months was 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). There were also a reduction in the average anxiety and depression scores using HADS, from 7.4 to 6 for anxiety and 6.3 to 3.3 for depression.The majority of patients, who engaged reported an increase in self-efficacy in terms of achieving weight loss. An important outcome (measured via patients qualitative feedback) was around self-confidence and recognition that small changes were a great step in the right direction.A learning point when we are able to fully resume normal service delivery is to try and increase the number of patients benefitting from this service. We see scope to potentially access patients earlier in primary care before they are referred to the Gastroenterology Team thus reducing waiting times and freeing up secondary care medical staff for more complex cases.Although the Liver Nurse Specialist team were fully on board with identifying suitable patients, not all eligible patients took the service up. We are not sure the reason for this, although we are aware that the cohort of patients with NAFLD are often considered the hard to reach patients, faced with multiple challenges, which may mean health can slip down their priority list. It is worth noting that the majority of patients seen had complex long standing issues contributing to their poor health. Aspects of family functioning including conflict and divorce;emotional eating, insomnia, depression, anxiety we e highlighted and in most cases were worked with throughout the support sessions from the psychologist.Overall, it is considered that this new pathway and multidisciplinary clinic has been very worthwhile. There have been noticeable improvements identified through the use of appropriate assessment tools and from positive qualitative patient and clinician feedback. In terms of future plans funding has been secured to work with innovation colleagues to provide a virtual version of supported self-management for less complex patients. This will allow a greater through put of patients and help further implement the new NAFLD pathway and multi-disciplinary approach.","output":"A patient centred pathway to support self management for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute bovine respiratory disease (ABRD) is a respiratory syndrome caused by various infectious agents, and represents a major economic and health problem in cattle herds worldwide. The aim of the study was to present how we can describe the epidemiological characteristics of ABRD in France, including risk factor analysis and spatio-temporal pattern investigation. The data were collected by specialized surveyors during the 2001 animal survey conducted by the French Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries, from a representative sample of cattle herds. The health questionnaire concerned farm characteristics, practice of BRD vaccination, presence of ABRD, time of occurrence and number of affected animals for the period November 2000COctober 2001. After a descriptive analysis of the syndrome, a spaceCtime scan statistic was performed to detect potential clusters, and a logistic regression model was used for analysis of risk factors. The study sample included 16,581 cattle herds as representative of the 260,000 French herds. The ABRD cumulative incidence at farm level was 9.8%, the cumulative incidence at animal level was 2.1%, the cumulative mortality 0.1% and the lethality proportion 6.5%. ABRD occurred mainly during cold months with an epidemic peak in December. Spatial repartition of the syndrome showed that the whole territory was affected, with a higher number of cases in the north-east region, the main bovine production area in France. Three spaceCtime clusters were identified in the period November 2000CFebruary 2001. ABRD was significantly associated with production type, herd size, and BRD vaccination. Beef herds were less affected than dairy herds, and increased herd size increased the risk of ABRD. The outbreak was clustered in space and time, suggesting a common infectious agent for the epidemic in the detected areas.

PDCoV disease caused acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death in piglets, resulted in significant economic loss to the pig industry. However, there is no commercially available vaccine for PDCoV. In this study, we constructed recombinant pseudorabies virus (rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S) expressing PDCoV spike (S) protein and evaluated its safety and immunogenicity in mice. RESULTS: The recombinant strain rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S obtained by CRISPR/Cas gE gene editing technology and homologous recombination technology has genetic stability in baby hamster syrian kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells and is safe to mice. After immunizing mice with rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S, the expression levels of IFN- and IL-4 in peripheral blood of mice were up-regulated, the proliferation of spleen-specific T lymphocytes and the percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes in mice spleen was increased. rPRVXJ-delgE/gI/TK-S showed good immunogenicity for mice. On the seventh day after booster immunity, PRV gB and PDCoV S specific antibodies were detected in mice, and the antibody level continued to increase, and the neutralizing antibody level reached the maximum at 28 days post- immunization (dpi). The recombinant strain can protect mice with 100% from the challenge of virulent strain (PRV XJ) and accelerate the detoxification of PDCoV in mice.

Senior authors realised that in lockdown there was only one option to see a patient: virtual consultation via telecommunication technologies. This paper will discuss the current benefits and considerations of Telemedicine, particularly in plastic surgery, to decipher the next route of action to further validate its use for future implementation. METHOD: A detailed literature review was carried out comparing papers from 1992 to 2020. A survey of 122 consultant plastic surgeons found an encouraging result as 70% positively embraced the suggestion of Telemedicine in their current practice. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine produced equal or improved patient satisfaction. Its utilisation reduced cost for patient, clinic and consultant. With accessibility to a large percentage of the population, Telemedicine enables infection control and adherence to social distancing during COVID-19. Considerations include dependability on internet access, legal aspects, cyber security and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the inability to perform palpation or physical inspection and psychological impacts on the patient. CONCLUSION: In modern times, Telemedicine has become more accessible and COVID-19 has made it more applicable than ever before. More in-depth research is needed for validation of this technique within plastic surgery. While maintaining quality of care and a vital role in social distancing, there is a strong need for standardisation of Telemedicine processes, platforms, encryption and data storage.

The aim of the current study was to confirm the previously proposed concept of coronary remodeling as first described by Glagov who studied postmortem left main coronary arteries (LMCAs). METHODS Using the in-vivo intravascular ultrasound data from the Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree (PROSPECT) study, we evaluated 552 LMCAs in 552 patients. RESULTS External elastic membrane cross-sectional areas (CSAs) increased in proportion to the increase in plaque and media CSAs (r=0.61, P<0.0001), especially when the plaque burden was 20% or lower (r=0.88, P<0.0001). For more advanced atherosclerosis (>40% plaque burden), there was an inverse relationship between lumen CSA and plaque burden (r=-0.57, P<0.0001), whereas this relationship was weak in the presence of less than 40% plaque burden. The frequency of virtual histology derived thin-cap fibroatheroma increased with increasing plaque burden. In contrast, the frequency of pathological intimal thickening decreased.

Moreover, the study discovered that tourists count more on virtual currency and prepare for a future with virtual currency when a factor that has an unstable impact on social economy, such as COVID-19, happens. As to the functions of Bitcoin, tourists appeared to place a great importance on its storage, value, satisfaction, convenience, and investment.

Different mesh materials and different surgical techniques for mesh fixation have been applied to reduce chronic postoperative pain, with controversial, nevertheless, results. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the effect of a relatively new mesh with self-fixating properties, used to repair inguinal hernia with the Lichtenstein technique, on early and chronic postoperative pain. METHODS Between June 2009 and June 2010, 50 patients with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were treated using the Lichtenstein technique. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a polypropylene mesh, fixed with polypropylene sutures (n = 25; group A), or a self-fixating polypropylene mesh with resorbable polylactic acid microgrips (n = 25; group B). Demographic data were recorded. Early and chronic postoperative pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Duration of surgery, complications, length of hospitalization and recurrence were also recorded. RESULTS No statistical difference was found between the two groups in association to demographic data. Operating time was 53.4  12.5 and 44.4  7.2 min in groups A and B, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). No difference was observed between the groups regarding the postoperative complications. The VAS of early postoperative pain was 1.7  1.9 in group A and 1.3  1.6 in group B, with the difference being not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Concerning chronic pain, no remarkable statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups at 3-month, 1- and 2-year follow-up period. At the end of the study, no recurrence was reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS Self-fixating mesh can be safely and effectively used in inguinal hernia repair with the additional advantage of reducing the operative time compared to the classic Lichtenstein technique. However, its use is not accompanied by reduced rates in early or chronic postoperative pain.","output":"Lichtenstein technique for inguinal hernia repair using polypropylene mesh fixed with sutures vs. self-fixating polypropylene mesh: a prospective randomized comparative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of the Chinese province Hubei.

METHODS: Observational pilot study in 5 steps. 1) Recruitment of PCPs. 2) Intervention: training on palliative care competencies and communication skills addressing end-of-life issues. 3) Recruitment of advanced cancer patients by PCPs. 4) Patients follow-up by PCPs, and assessment of their quality of life by a research assistant 5) Feedback from PCPs using a semi-structured focus group and three individual interviews with qualitative deductive theme analysis. RESULTS: Eight PCPs were trained. Patient recruitment was a challenge for PCPs who feared to impose additional loads on their patients. PCPs became more conscious of their role and responsibility during oncologic treatments and felt empowered to take a more active role picking up patients cues and addressing advance directives. They developed interprofessional collaborations for advance care planning. Overall, they discovered the role to help patients to make decisions for a better end-of-life.

METHODS Thirty GPs were enrolled in a short ultrasound training program and taught how to perform 22 selected scanning modalities. In the following 3 months, the GPs registered all performed PoCUS examinations according to the Audit Project Odense method. After 5 months, the GPs were invited to participate in an evaluation seminar, where questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS During the registration period, 1598 patients were examined with PoCUS.

However, it is unknown how competent and confident podiatrists are in administering CPR and how they would respond in an emergency. Having a health professional who has a competent knowledge of CPR and skills in basic life support, can improve survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the aim of this study was to survey New Zealand podiatrists to determine their CPR knowledge and qualifications; beliefs about the application of CPR; and perceptions of their competency in CPR. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a web-based survey. Participants were New Zealand registered podiatrists with a current annual practising certificate. The 31-item survey included questions to elicit demographic information, CPR practice and attitudes, and CPR knowledge. Responses were collected between March and August 2020. RESULTS: 171 podiatrists responded to the survey. 16 % of the podiatrists (n = 28) had performed CPR in an emergency, with a 50 % success rate. Participants were predominantly female (n = 127, 74 %) and working in private practice (n = 140,82 %). Nearly half of respondents were younger than 40 years (n = 75,44 %) and had less than 10 years of clinical experience (n = 73, 43 %). Nearly all (n = 169,97 %) participants had received formal CPR training in the past two years, with 60 % (n = 105) receiving training in the past 12 months. Most respondents (n = 167,98 %) self-estimated their CPR ability as being effective, very effective, or extremely effective. Participants knowledge of CPR was variable, with the percentage of correct answers for CPR protocol statements ranging between 20 and 90 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first insight into New Zealand podiatrists CPR knowledge and perceptions. Podiatrists were found to have high levels of CPR confidence but demonstrated gaps in CPR knowledge. Currently, New Zealand registered podiatrists require biennial CPR re-certification. However, resuscitation authorities in New Zealand and overseas recommend an annual update of CPR skills. Based on this studys findings, and in line with Australia and the United Kingdom, the authors recommend a change from biennial to annual CPR re-certification for podiatrists in New Zealand.

This study aims to characterize the changes in trauma admissions during the first 5-week lockdown period. The hypothesis states that there would be a significant reduction in overall orthopedic trauma admissions, polytrauma, and high-energy outdoor trauma during this COVID-19 period. METHODS: All trauma admissions over nearly a 5-week period from March 23, 2020, to April 26, 2020, were collated as the COVID cohort and compared to the control group of patients from the same hospitals 1 year before between March 23, 2019, and April 26, 2019. Spinal admissions and pediatrics were excluded from the study as they were managed in other regional units. RESULTS: There was a 56% reduction in trauma admissions during the COVID-19 lockdown (133 vs. 304). A majority of the COVID cohort were admitted with fractures (89 vs. 164, P = 0.017, Chi-square test) from home with low-energy falls. Overall, fewer operations were performed than the year before. However, a greater proportion of admitted patients had a surgical orthopedic intervention rather than admission and nonoperative management. CONCLUSIONS: There was a reduction in admissions as well as reductions in high energy and occupational injuries. Elderly patients continued to fall at home or in care, sustaining hip fractures.

While autophagy has been shown to function in host antiviral defense by eliminating intracellular viruses and regulating adaptive immunity, several viruses have evolved molecular mechanisms to get benefits from it. The deltaretrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) has been reported to profit its replication from enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Here, we reported that HLA-DMB (generally referred to here as DMB), the beta chain of the non-classical MHC-II protein HLA-DM, had strong expression in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and could be induced in Hela, PMA-differentiated THP1 (PMA-THP1) or primary human monocytes by HTLV-1 infection. Immunoblot and real-time PCR assays demonstrated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 protein expression while the knockdown of DMB increased HTLV-1 protein expression. Immunoblot and confocal microscopy assays indicated that overexpression of DMB decreased HTLV-1 induced autophagosome accumulation while the knockdown of DMB yielded the opposite effects. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation experiments suggested DMB interacted with autophagy-related gene (ATG) 7 and increased the acetylation of ATG7. Taken together, these results suggested DMB modulated HTLV-1 protein expression through regulation of autophagosome accumulation and our findings suggested a new mechanism by which the host cells defended against HTLV-1 infection.","output":"HLA-DMB restricts human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) protein expression via regulation of ATG7 acetylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite anticipated increased risk of COVID-19 and increased expression of the SARS CoV-2 receptor (ACE2), the relatively low mortality of pregnant women with COVID-19 has been an area of wonder.

Specifically, the accessibility from those countries that were infected by SARS, beginning with China, to other countries was measured using airline schedules. The country\\\\pair accessibility measure, along with other country\\\\level factors relevant to the disease, were tested as determinants of the speed with which SARS arrived in infected countries as well as its failure to arrive in most countries. The analyses indicate that airline network accessibility was an especially influential variable but also that the importance of this variable diminished in the latter weeks of the outbreak. The latter finding is partly attributable to public health measures, particularly health screening in airports. The timing and geography of those measures are reviewed using data from media reports and interim World Health Organization (WHO) documents during the outbreak. The uneven effort to curtail the international diffusion of SARS suggests further planning is needed to develop a concerted response to contain future epidemics.","output":"Airline networks and the international diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweden's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response, initially based largely on voluntary measures, has evoked strong reactions nationally and internationally. In this study, we describe Sweden's national policy response with regard to the general public, the community and the health care system, with a focus on how the response changed from March 2020 to June 2021. A number of factors contributed to Sweden's choice of policy response, including its existing legal framework, independent expert agencies and its decentralized, multi-level health care governance system. Challenges to the health- and elder care system during the pandemic, such as the need to increase intensive care- and testing capacity, and to ensure the safety of the elderly were addressed largely at the regional and local levels, with national authorities assuming a primarily coordinative role. Although the overall response based on voluntary compliance has persisted, the national government started to take a more prominent role in public messaging, and in enacting legally binding restrictions during subsequent waves of the pandemic. This study illustrates that not only policy responses, but also the fundamental structure of the health- and elder care system and its governance should be considered when evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Soft law and individual responsibility: a review of the Swedish policy response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are protein kinases that function in concert with arrestins in the regulation of a diverse class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling.

Physicians managing immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) must complete special authorization (SA) and prescription renewal (Rx) forms for patients on biologic therapy. This adds significant administrative burden potentially leading to delays in therapy initiation and care continuity. Historically, document completion has largely been paper-based, with forms faxed between patient support programs (PSPs) and physician offices. Disruption of normal office processes during the pandemic necessitated the movement of existing paper-based workflows online. The use of secure electronic document signing (SEDS) platforms has allowed physicians to receive and complete documents digitally. Aims: To evaluate the impact of SEDS-based biologic documentation on clinical practice. Objectives were 1) to determine if the use of SEDS platforms increased timeliness of document returns compared to traditional workflows 2) assess whether SEDS usage is acceptable and sustainable and 3) assess MD satisfaction with SEDS platforms. Methods: This was a retrospective audit of SEDS and paper-based biologic document workflows from a single PSP (Abbvie Care). Outcomes of interest were the number of documents completed monthly using SEDS, new monthly users, and the number of active monthly users between April 1, 2020-March 31, 2021. Time (days) to SEDS completion (vs. paper process) was determined by reviewing timepoint data for SA and Rx documents from May 2019-January 2020 (pre- SEDS) and for SEDS documents from May 2020-January 2021(SEDS). The return time (RT) was defined as the time between date sent to a physicians office by the PSP to the date returned to the PSP. Documents in the pre-SEDS cohort with a RT exceeding 30 days were excluded Results: In totally, 5573 SA and Rx documents were completed by 383 physicians using the SEDS platform from April 2020-March 2021. A mean of 14.6 (sd 21.8) documents were signed per physician. The number of monthly electronic documents processed increased from 104 in April 2020 to 800 in March 2021. Active monthly users increased from 24 in April 2020 to 213 in March 2021 (31 new users monthly). A total of 19,387 paper documents were processed during the pre-SEDS period and 3,317 electronic documents processed in the SEDS period. The mean RT in the pre-SEDS period was 8.03 days (Sd 8.2) and the SEDS period was 1.11 days (sd 2.6). Conclusion: This data demonstrates acceptability, appropriateness, and improved processing efficiency of an SEDS platform improving timeliness of patient care.

Monocytes play an important role in the initiation and resolution of inflammation, and their diverse functions can be attributed to specific cellular subsets: pro-inflammatory or classical monocytes (Ly6cHi) and pro-reparative or non-classical monocytes (Ly6cLo). We hypothesized that inherent differences in Ly6cHi classical monocytes and Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes determine susceptibility to perinatal hepatic inflammation in late gestation fetuses and neonates. We found an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile expressed by Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes, and a physiologic abundance of these cells in the late gestation fetal liver. Unlike neonatal pups, late gestation fetuses proved to be resistant to rhesus rotavirus (RRV) mediated liver inflammation. Furthermore, neonatal pups were rendered resistant to RRV-mediated liver injury when Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes were expanded. Pharmacologic inhibition of Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes in this setting restored susceptibility to RRV-mediated disease. These data demonstrate that Ly6cLo monocytes promote resolution of perinatal liver inflammation in the late gestation fetus, where there is a physiologic expansion of non-classical monocytes, and in the neonatal liver upon experimental expansion of these cells. Therapeutic strategies directed towards enhancing Ly6cLo non-classical monocyte function may mitigate the detrimental effects of perinatal liver inflammation.","output":"Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes promote resolution of rhesus rotavirus-mediated perinatal hepatic inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Given the overwhelming worldwide rate of infection and the disappointing pace of vaccination, addressing reinfection is critical. Understanding reinfection, including protection longevity after natural infection, will allow us to better know the prospect of herd immunity, which hinges on the assumption that natural infection generates sufficient, protective immunity. The primary aim of this paper is to provide data on SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over a 10-month period. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to establish the incidence of reinfection of COVID-19 among healthcare employees who experienced a prior COVID-19 infection. Design: This observational cohort study followed a convenience sample of 2,625 participants who experienced a COVID-19 infection for subsequent COVID-19 infection. Setting: Healthcare employees were recruited across a large Midwestern healthcare system. Positive PCR test results were administered and recorded by the system-affiliated lab serving Illinois and Wisconsin. Participants: Adult healthcare system employees who enrolled in a research study focused on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (N = 16,357) and had at least one positive PCR test result between March 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021 were included (N = 2,625). Exposure: Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome is incidence of COVID-19 reinfection, defined by current CDC guidelines (i.e. subsequent COVID-19 infection [] 90 days from prior infection). COVID-19 recurrence, defined as subsequent COVID-19 infection after prior infection irrespective of time, is also described. Results: Of 2,625 participants who experienced at least one COVID-19 infection during the 10-month study period, 156 (5.94%) experienced reinfection and 540 (20.57%) experienced recurrence after prior infection. Median days were 126.50 (105.50-171.00) to reinfection and 31.50 (10.00-72.00) to recurrence. Incidence rate of COVID-19 reinfection was 0.35 cases per 1,000 person-days, with participants working in COVID-clinical and clinical units experiencing 3.77 and 3.57 times, respectively, greater risk of reinfection relative to those working in non-clinical units. Incidence rate of COVID-19 recurrence was 1.47 cases per 1,000 person-days.

Results: 53.6% felt that medical students should not undergo clinical teaching in the ED and 60.7% did not wish to teach medical students during the outbreak. Three themes arose during the analysis of the data - Cognitive Overload of Clinical Teachers, Prioritisation of Clinical Staff Welfare versus Medical Students, and Risk of Viral Exposure versus Clinical Education.

The identified variants were verified in the remaining members. The pathogenicity of candidate variants was predicted using multiple software programmes. A 28-year-old non-consanguineous Chinese woman at 23 weeks' gestation presenting with sustained foetal bradycardia of 100 b.p.m. Immunological disorders and infection were excluded.

METHODS: A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. RESULTS: The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration.

Dyadic analyses were used to determine whether trait anxiety affects the risk of depression and whether a mutual influence process occurs prior and post cancer diagnosis. Cross-sectional analyses were performed at two time-points: before and after receiving the diagnosis. RESULTS A higher level of anxiety among cancer patients resulted in a decreased risk of depression among spousal caregivers. Moreover, a higher anxiety among spousal caregivers increased their own risk of depression, but it didn't influence depression risk among cancer patients. While there is an intra-individual relationship between a higher level of trait anxiety and a greater risk of depression prior to cancer diagnosis, there is no cross-influence between spouses.

In the field of aesthetic surgery, the self-imposed moratorium for all aesthetic surgery procedures recommended by most international scientific societies has been adopted by many surgeons worldwide and resulted in a huge socioeconomic impact for most private practices and clinics. An important question still unanswered in most countries is when and how should elective/aesthetic procedures be scheduled again and what kind of organizational changes are necessary to protect patients and healthcare workers when clinics and practices reopen. Defining manageable, evidence-based protocols for testing, surgical/procedural risk mitigation and clinical flow management/contamination management will be paramount for the safety of non-urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE/PubMed research for all available publications on COVID-19 and surgery and COVID-19 and anesthesia. Articles and referenced literature describing possible procedural impact factors leading to exacerbation of the clinical evolution of COVID-19-positive patients were identified to perform risk stratification for elective surgery. Based on these impact factors, considerations for patient selection, choice of procedural complexity, duration of procedure, type of anesthesia, etc., are discussed in this article and translated into algorithms for surgical/anesthesia risk management and clinical management. Current recommendations and published protocols on contamination control, avoidance of cross-contamination and procedural patient flow are reviewed. A COVID-19 testing guideline protocol for patients planning to undergo elective aesthetic surgery is presented and recommendations are made regarding adaptation of current patient information/informed consent forms and patient health questionnaires. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 crisis has led to unprecedented challenges in the acute management of the crisis, and the wave only recently seems to flatten out in some countries. The adaptation of surgical and procedural steps for a risk-minimizing management of potential COVID-19-positive patients seeking to undergo elective aesthetic procedures in the wake of that wave will present the next big challenge for the aesthetic surgery community. We propose a clinical algorithm to enhance patient safety in elective surgery in the context of COVID-19 and to minimize cross-contamination between healthcare workers and patients. New evidence-based guidelines regarding surgical risk stratification, testing, and clinical flow management/contamination management are proposed. We believe that only the continuous development and broad implementation of guidelines like the ones proposed in this paper will allow an early reintegration of all aesthetic procedures into the scope of surgical care currently performed and to prepare the elective surgical specialties better for a possible second wave of the pandemic.

PPG data were measured using telemedicine in both groups. Group 1 consisted of healthy people aged 25 to 35 years, and Group 2 consisted of patients between 60 and 75 years of age taking antihypertensive medications.

Neurology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the lungs but can involve any organ. The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease. On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles. The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes. The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community. CASE REPORT: We report on a COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state in a 65-year-old man with no history of comorbid illness. Initially, he presented with right-sided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block. The patients elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction (MI). His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature. But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented. The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes.

Vaccines are in scare supply, however. Current recommendations in the United States are that subjects with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease should receive the full vaccine regimen. This is despite the fact that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection infection confers some degree of protection and that the immune response to the vaccine is not well studied. Methods: The present study compared the time course and magnitude of the humoral immune response to an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2) in subjects with prior infection/COVID-19 disease (n=24) and those without prior infection (n=25). Serum anti-Spike RBD antibody and serum neutralizing activity were assessed longitudinally prior to and at 2-week intervals for 56 days post first dose of vaccine. Subjects received the standard Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine regimen i.e., two doses of 30 mcg, 3 weeks apart. Findings: The cohort with prior COVID-19 achieved robust increases in anti-Spike IgG antibody and serum neutralizing activity compared to the SARS-CoV-2 naive cohort at day 14 post vaccine. Thereafter, the COVID-19 cohort showed relatively little further increase in humoral immunity even after the second dose such that anti-Spike IgG and neutralizing activity were similar in the 2 groups from day 28 through day 56. Conclusions: In contrast to the responses of SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects in whom a 2 dose regimen appears to be required to achieve robust immune protection, subjects with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit immune memory and have a robust response to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine. They may require only a single dose of vaccine.","output":"Heightened COVID-19 Vaccine Response following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to identify facilitating factors in cultivating a linguistically and culturally diverse virtual Community of Practice (CoP) and techniques in tailoring such support for international graduate teaching assistants (ITAs) at a US university while assessing indications for ITAs' self-perceptions in four key areas: social connectedness, confidence teaching in English, pedagogical support and self-efficacy in teaching Design/methodology/approach: This mixed-methods case study qualitatively analyzes open-ended responses utilizing a Grounded Action Research approach along with follow-up interviews of ITAs Quantitative measures of key perception areas between three Experience Groups were conducted to identify potential correlations with involvement in the CoP Findings: Calculations using the KruskalCWallis test of differences yielded no statistically significant results However, qualitative analyses highlight ITAs' needs, classified into four general concepts and 16 specific core categories Evaluation of CoP communications suggests COVID-19 and a sudden transition to online teaching represented recognizable shared problems that invigorated the CoP and overshadowed diversity-related factors Research limitations/implications: These findings have implications for culturally and linguistically diverse CoPs and particularly for ITA training programs worldwide, allowing universities to enhance support of ITAs and bolster development of undergraduate programs especially during times of crisis and transitions to online learning Originality/value: The first study to investigate an international, multilingual ITA population in a virtual CoP regardless of academic discipline, this contributes by addressing several common CoP criticisms, including cultivation in distributed contexts and in further guiding expectations for its adoption into culturally and linguistically diverse communities ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Facilitating factors in cultivating diverse online communities of practice: a case of international teaching assistants during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 response, nonclinical essential workers usually worked overtime and experienced significant work stress, which subsequently increased their risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and pre-existing conditions. Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the trends and characteristics of deaths related to overwork among the frontline nonclinical essential workers participating in nonpharmaceutical interventions during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming. Policies for occupational health protection against work hazards should therefore be prioritized and enforced.","output":"The Uncounted Casualties of a Hidden COVID-19 Epidemic in China: Cross-sectional Study on Deaths Related to Overwork"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical advances have allowed people to live longer and this has presented different challenges to support them to keep living independently at home. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the situation with less care staff and resources available for the elderly, which have also been spending more time at their homes without external contact.

The model considers more than 7 million people, 3 million indoor environments, and 2566 public transport routes in Hong Kong. Smallpox, which could be spread through airborne routes, is studied as an example. The simulation is based on people's daily commutes and indoor human behaviors, which were summarized by mathematical patterns. We found that 59.6%, 18.1%, and 13.4% of patients become infected in their homes, offices, and schools, respectively. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1000, an infectious disease will be effectively controlled after 2 months. The peak number of infected people will be reduced by 25% compared to taking no action, and the time of peak infections will be delayed by about 40 days if 90% of the infected people go to hospital during the infectious period. When ventilation rates in indoor environments increase to five times their default settings, smallpox will be naturally controlled.

Our understanding of that question has been dictated by holism, as defined by the biopsychosocial model, since the late twentieth century. Unfortunately, holism was characterized at the start with confused definitions of 'dualism' and 'reductionism', and that problem has led to a deep, unrecognized conceptual split in the medical professions. Some insist that holism is a nonreductionist approach that aligns with some form of dualism, while others insist it's a reductionist view that sets out to eradicate dualism. It's important to consider each version. Nonreductive holism is philosophically consistent and clinically unproblematic. Reductive holism, however, is conceptually incoherent-yet it is the basis for the common idea that the boundary between medical and mental health disorders must be vague. When we trace that idea through to its implementation in medical practice, we find evidence that it compromises the safety of patient care in the large portion of cases where clinicians grapple with diagnosis at the boundary between psychiatry and medicine. Having established that medicine must embrace some form of nonreductionism, I argue that Chalmers' naturalistic dualism is a stronger prima facie candidate than the nonreductive alternatives.

Inpatient or full-day outpatient rehabilitation are some of the standard therapies. For sustainable rehabilitation, continuation of rehabilitation after discharge from a rehabilitation centre is vital. Besides medical exercise therapy (MET), home-based physical exercise programmes are used. To monitor exercise quantity and quality, AGT-Reha, a health-enabling technology for home rehabilitation, has been developed and evaluated in a pilot study for technical feasibility and acceptance. To integrate the digital therapeutic AGT-Reha into regular healthcare processes, an efficacy evaluation is required. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: AGT-Reha-WK is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomised, unblinded non-inferiority trial. Primary objective is to investigate whether AGT-Reha enhanced home-based exercise training is non-inferior to MET as standard aftercare. Secondary objective is to compare the costs of both therapies. Efficacy as medical success (primary outcome) is examined with regard to ability to work, return to work and sustainability of training (secondary outcomes). The outcome measure for non-inferiority is shoulder function (pain and disability) assessed by the standardised Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The non-inferiority margin is set to 10 points on SPADI score using a 95% CI. Subjects will be recruited at the Rehabilitation Center Bad Pyrmont, Germany. The total number of subjects should be 84 (42 per group). Treatment takes 6 months per patient. Subjects will be assessed at four time points: pre-baseline (admission to rehabilitation centre), baseline (discharge from rehabilitation centre), post-therapy and follow-up (3 months post-therapy).

Within our department, a multidisciplinary tracer team prospectively monitored all patients under investigation, tracking their test status, treatment delays, clinical outcomes, employee exposures and quarantines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort tested for SARS-COV-2 infection over 35 consecutive days of the early pandemic (03/19/2020-04/22/2020). RESULTS: A total of 121 Radiation Oncology patients underwent RT-PCR testing during this timeframe. Of the 7 (6%) confirmed-positive cases, 6 patients were admitted (including 4 warranting intensive care), 2 of whom died from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Radiotherapy was deferred or interrupted for 40 patients awaiting testing. As the median turnaround time for RT-PCR testing decreased from 1.5 (IQR: 1-4) to 1-day (P<0.001), the median treatment delay also decreased from 3.5 (IQR: 1.75-5) to 1 business day (IQR: 1-2) [P<0.001]. Each patient was an exposure risk to a median of 5 employees (IQR: 3-6.5) through prolonged close contact. During this timeframe, 39 care-team members were quarantined for a median of 3 days (IQR: 2-11), with a peak of 17 employees simultaneously quarantined. Following implementation of a dual PPE policy, newly quarantined employees decreased from 2.9 to 0.5 per day. CONCLUSION: The severe adverse events noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are vulnerable to COVID-19. Active tracking, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive source control can mitigate the adverse effects on treatment delays, workforce incapacitation, and ideally outcomes.","output":"Mitigating the Impact of COVID-19 on Oncology: Clinical and Operational Lessons from a Prospective Radiation Oncology Cohort Tested for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in adults on the autistic spectrum, and more recently, the challenges related to aging in this population.

RESULTS: Deceased patients were more like to have dementia, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and balance difficulties; higher heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and absolute neutrophils; lower oxygen saturation and absolute lymphocytes; and shorter length of hospitalization. Logistic regression based on three mortality predictors (ARDS, AMS, and length of hospitalization) correctly predicted 87% of the outcome (89% sensitivity at 85% specificity).

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in China in late December 2019 and is indeed referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. The whole globe was hit within several months. As millions of individuals around the world are infected with COVID-19, it has become a global health concern. The disease is usually contagious, and those who are infected can quickly pass it on to others with whom they come into contact. As a result, monitoring is an effective way to stop the virus from spreading further. Another disease caused by a virus similar to COVID-19 is pneumonia. The severity of pneumonia can range from minor to life-threatening. This is particularly hazardous for children, people over 65 years of age, and those with health problems or immune systems that are affected. In this paper, we have classified COVID-19 and pneumonia using deep transfer learning. Because there has been extensive research on this subject, the developed method concentrates on boosting precision and employs a transfer learning technique as well as a model that is custom-made. Different pretrained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used to extract deep features. The classification accuracy was used to measure performance to a great extent.

Repair mechanisms induced following virus infection can restore the protective barrier through wound healing. Then, cells from the epithelial basal layer repopulate the damaged area, followed by cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as changes in gene expression. METHODS: Using Beas-2B cells and SP, we investigated whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) contributes to restoration of the bronchial epithelial layer. ACE2 expression was measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. SPCACE2 interaction was analyzed by flow cytometry and visualized through immunostaining. Cell migration was assessed using single cell path tracking and wound healing assay. RESULTS: Upon ACE2 overexpression in HeLa, HEK293T, and Beas-2B cells following the transfection of pCMV-ACE2 plasmid DNA, SP binding on each cell was increased in the ACE2 overexpression group compared to pCMV-transfected control cells. SP treatment delayed the migration of BEAS-2B cells compared to the control. SP also reduced cell migration, even under ACE2 overexpression; SP binding was greater in ACE2-overexpressed cells than control cells. CONCLSION: UDCA interfered significantly with the binding of SP to ACE2 under our experimental conditions. UDCA also restored the inhibitory migration of Beas-2B cells induced by SP treatment. These results suggest that UDCA can enhance the repair mechanism, to prevent damage caused by SPCACE2 interaction and enhance restoration of the epithelial basal layer.","output":"Ursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates cell migration retarded by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure are the key features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the involvement of other organs such as the kidney has also been reported.

In this study, we report our unique experience with AKI in COVID-19 patients in a low socioeconomic and predominantly ethnic minority group and provide its incidence, risk factors, and prognosis to expand the current understanding of this complication. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we analyzed the data of 469 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, from March 18 through April 23, 2020. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory data, and outcomes was collected from the electronic medical records. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of AKI with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 25C75; range 19C101 years), and 268 (57.14%) patients were male. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation was low (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) in 207 (44.1%) patients. During hospitalization, 128 (27.3%) patients developed AKI, and the incidence was significantly higher in those patients presenting with a low eGFR (N = 81, 39.1%; p < 0.001). Male sex, hypertension, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, hemodynamic instability, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and admission elevated ferritin, creatinine kinase, brain natriuretic peptide, and troponin 1 were identified as the risk factors for in-hospital AKI. Ninety-seven (28.45%) patients died in the non-AKI group versus 91 (71.1%) in the AKI group (p < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, hemodynamic status, and PF ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2]/fractional inspired oxygen [FiO2]) determined that on admission, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23C2.48), a low eGFR (HR 1.43; CI 1.1C2.03), AKI stage 1 (HR 1.14; CI 0.64C2.03), AKI stage 2 (HR 1.86; CI 1.03C3.56), and AKI stage 3 (HR 2.1; CI 1.3C2.81) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality.

The comparator was any test used as a comparison to the index test. In order not to limit the study inclusion, the comparator was not defined a priori. ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF BIAS: Four investigators independently extracted data, rated risk of bias, and assessed the quality using QUADAS-2. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The measures of diagnostic test accuracy were calculated with 95% CI. RESULTS: A total of 421 studies addressed at least one point-of-care test. The diagnostic performance of molecular tests was higher compared with that of rapid diagnostic tests for all the pathogens studied. The accuracy of stand-alone signs and symptoms or biomarkers was poor. Lung ultrasound showed high sensitivity and specificity (90% for both) for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae had sub-optimal sensitivity (range 49%-84%) but high specificity (>80%). DISCUSSION: Physical examination and host biomarkers are not sufficiently reliable as stand-alone tests to differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia. Lung ultrasound shows higher accuracy than chest X-ray for bacterial pneumonia at emergency department. Rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests cannot be considered fully reliable because of high false-negative rates.

N appears to be a multifunctional protein since data also suggest that the protein may be involved in viral RNA replication and translation. All of these functions presumably involve interactions between N and viral RNAs. As a step toward understanding how N interacts with viral RNAs, we mapped high-efficiency N-binding sites within BCV- and MHV-defective genomes. Both in vivo and in vitro assays were used to study binding of BCV and MHV N proteins to viral and nonviral RNAs. NCviral RNA complexes were detected in bovine coronavirus (BCV)-infected cells and in cells transiently expressing the N protein. Filter binding was used to map N-binding sites within Drep, a BCV-defective genome that is replicated and packaged in the presence of helper virus. One high-efficiency N-binding site was identified between nucleotides 1441 and 1875 at the 3 end of the N ORF within Drep. For comparative purposes N-binding sites were also mapped for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV)-defective interfering (DI) RNA MIDI-C. Binding efficiencies similar to those for Drep were measured for RNA transcripts of a region encompassing the MHV packaging signal (nts 3949C4524), as well as a region at the 3 end of the MHV N ORF (nts 4837C5197) within MIDI-C. Binding to the full-length MIDI-C transcript (5500 nts) and to an 1-kb transcript from the gene 1a region (nts 935C1986) of MIDI-C that excluded the packaging signal were both significantly higher than that measured for the smaller transcripts. This is the first identification of N-binding sequences for BCV.

From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. RESULTS: Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16 g/kg.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are established interventions to improve cardiovascular health, despite asymmetries in referral. With covid 19 outbreak, cardiac rehabilitation home based (CR-HB) programs emerged as an alternative. However, its adherence and implementation may vary greatly with socio-demographic factors. PURPOSE: To assess adherence to the various components of a CR-HB program. METHODS: Prospective cohort study which included patients (pts) who were participating in a centre-based CR program and accepted to participate in a CR-HB after the centre-based CR program closure due to COVID-19. The CR-HB consisted in a multidisciplinary digital CR program, including: 1.patient clinical and exercise risk assessment; 2.psychological tele-appointments; 3. online exercise training sessions; 4.structured online educational program for patients and family members/caregivers; 5. follow-up questionnaires; 6. nutrition tele-appointments; 7. physician tele-appointments ADHERENCE TO THE PROGRAM WAS ASSESSED BY: drop-out rate; number of exercise sessions in which each patient participated; number of educational sessions attended and a validated questionnaire on therapeutic adherence (composed of 7 questions with minimum punctuation of 7 and maximum of 40 points). RESULTS: 116 cardiovascular disease (CVD) pts (62.6  8.9 years, 95 males) who were attending a Centre-based CR program were included in a CR-HB program. Almost 90% (n = 103) of the participants had coronary artery disease; 13.8% pts had heart failure; the mean LVEF was 52  11%. Regarding risk factors, obesity was the most common risk factor (74.7 %) followed by hypertension (59.6%), family history (41.8%), dyslipidaemia (37.9%), diabetes (18.1%), and smoking (12.9%). Ninety-eight pts (85.5%) successfully completed the program. Almost half (46.9%) of the participants did at least one online exercise training session per week. Among the pts who did online exercise training sessions, 58% did 2-3 times per week, 27% once per week and 15% more than 4 times per week. The pts participated, on average, in 1.45  2.6 education sessions (rate of participation of 13,2%) and therapeutic adherence was high (39,7  19; min 35-40). Regarding educational status of the pts, 33 pts (45,2%) had a bachelor degree. These pts tended to participate more in exercise sessions (1,7  1,7 vs 1,2  1,4 sessions per week) and in education sessions (2.13 vs 1.6), although this difference was not statistically significant. The therapeutic adherence did not vary with patients level of education. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that a high percentage of patients completed the program and almost half were weekly physically active. However, in regard to educational sessions, the degree of participation was much lower. Educational status seemed to correlate with a higher degree of participation and, in the future, patient selection might offer better results in these kinds of programs.","output":"Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation: the patients claim for new strategies but do they adhere?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United Nations have described the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as the worst global crisis since the second world war.

Compared to standard care, continuous glucose monitoring can provide detailed information about glycaemic variability in an internationally standardised ambulatory glucose profile, enabling more informed user and clinician decision-making. We aimed to review the evidence, user experience, and cost-effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring. METHODS A literature search was conducted by combining subject headings \\"continuous glucose monitoring\\" and \\"flash glucose monitoring\\", with key words \\"type 1 diabetes\\" and \\"type 2 diabetes\\", limited to \\"1999 to current\\". Further evidence was obtained from relevant references of retrieved articles. RESULTS There is strong evidence for continuous glucose monitoring use in people with type 1 diabetes, with benefits of reduced glycated haemoglobin and hypoglycaemia, and increased time in range. While the evidence for continuous glucose monitoring use in type 2 diabetes is less robust, similar benefits have been demonstrated. Continuous glucose monitoring can improve diabetes-related satisfaction in people with diabetes and parents of children with diabetes, as well as the clinician experience. However, continuous glucose monitoring does have limitations including cost, accuracy and perceived inconvenience. Cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that continuous glucose monitoring is a cost-effective adjunct to type 1 diabetes management that is associated with reduced diabetes-related complications and hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS Continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionising diabetes management.

Even though several primary studies have been conducted on the incidence of tuberculosis among HIV-infected individuals in Ethiopia, national-level tuberculosis incidence is unknown. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess the TB incidence rate and its predictors among HIV-infected individuals after the initiation of ART in Ethiopia. METHODS: We conducted an extensive search of literature as indicated in the guideline of reporting systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA). The databases used were PubMed, Google Scholar, and HINARI literature. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument for critical appraisal of studies. The meta-analysis and Meta regressions were conducted using STATA 14 software. Met-analysis and meta-regression were computed to present the pooled incidence rate and predictors of tuberculosis among HIV-infected patients after initiation of ART with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Among a total of 189 studies, 11 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated pooled incidence rate of TB per 100-person year observation (PYO) among HIV-infected patients after initiation of ART therapy was 4.8(95% CI 3.69C5.83). In subgroup analysis, the estimated pooled incidence of tuberculosis showed a slight difference between adults and children after initiation of ART treatment, which was 4.3 (95% CI 2.96, 5.71) and 5.0 (95% CI 3.51, 6.50), respectively. Significantly pooled estimates of predictors of TB incidence by a meta-analysis were being anemic (2.30, 95% CI 1.75, 3.02); on clinical stages III and IV (2.26, 95% CI 1.70, 3.02); and not on cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) (2.16, 95% CI 1.23, 3.72). Besides, a meta-regression revealed that CD4 <200 cells/mm(3) (2.12, 95% CI 1.17, 3.86) was a positive significant predictor of TB among HIV patients after the initiation of ART. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that the pooled incidence of TB among HIV patients was found to be lower than the WHO 2018 national estimate. Being anemic, WHO stages III and IV, not on CPT, CD4<200cells/l, and being male were significant predictors of tuberculosis. Therefore, the existing strategies to decrease TB should be strengthening.

RESULTS: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed >99% sequence identity with the reference strain. CONCLUSION: HBoV detection was infrequent.

The lockdown and pandemic crisis caused new issues and placed us in an entirely new context, changing our way of life, work time and conditions, and habits. Coping with such an unprecedented situation may have stimulated creativity. However, the situation also restricted our liberties and wellbeing and triggered health or psychological difficulties. Worrying, concerns, challenging conditions of confinement may have hampered creativity or its expression. Hence, wellbeing factors related to affective experience, living conditions, social interactions, as well as workload or available free time, may have impacted creativity during the lockdown. We carried out an online survey based on a self-administered questionnaire to examine whether the first lockdown period related to the COVID-19 pandemic (spring 2020) was associated with creativity changes and explore the role of several factors in these changes. We measured self-reported creativity changes using two approaches: changes in creative self-efficacy and creative activities and achievements. We related them to several variables estimating time availability, conditions of confinement, social interactions, and affective experience of the situation. Despite a global negative subjective experience of the situation, individuals who participated in our survey (n=380) reported that they were on average more creative during the lockdown than before and engaged in more creative activities. The converging results from self-perceived and activity-based measures showed that this positive change could be linked with more time availability, feeling more motivated or inspired, or the need to solve a problem. However, when negative changes in creativity were experienced, they were instead related to negative affective experiences, including stress and anxiety, a low mood, a feeling of pressure, or a lack of resources or opportunities.

PURPOSE: To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus. Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk-of-bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). DATA SYNTHESIS: 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders. A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very-low-certainty evidence). Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence). Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs. LIMITATION: Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported. CONCLUSION: Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.

To improving diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), we assessed the value of combining clinicopathological, conventional ultrasound, SWE features in the cT1-2N0 breast cancer patients. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 285 patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer who underwent preoperative ultrasound examination of the lesion and axillary, with shear wave elastography (SWE) of the lesions. According to the postoperative pathological results, they were divided into 2 metastatic ALNs group (low nodal burden, LNB) and > 2 metastatic ALNs group (high nodal burden, HNB). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent risk factors and establish prediction models. The best cut-off value of continuous variables is determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the performance of the prediction model is evaluated. RESULTS Presence of lymphovascular invasion (OR = 7.966, P = 0.010), tumor size (OR = 2.485, P = 0.019), Emean of intratumor (OR = 0.939, P = 0.002) and cortical thickness of lymph node (OR = 9.277, P < 0.001) were independent risk predictors for HNB of cT1-2N0 Group.

To be effective in the digital environment, school teachers have to master new transprofessional competences (TPCs), enabling them to use the skill sets of other careers, gain new skills and abilities and find non-standard solutions to professional and pedagogical problems using digital technologies. This study investigated education employers opinions (61 principals and deputy principals from 31 Russian secondary schools) about the comparative importance of TPCs for school teachers working in the digital environment and their perceptions of what barriers prevent teachers from developing TPCs. The survey used a three-item questionnaire asking the respondents to rank the TPCs and the TPC clusters in order of importance for teachers working with the digital and to describe the obstacles to teachers TPC development. The findings revealed that the employers attached the greatest importance to psychological TPCs while assigning the least importance to digital citizenship TPCs. The major barriers to TPC development, in the respondents opinion, lay in teachers fear of new trends and their excessive workload. Based on the survey results, we designed a model of school teachers transprofessional competences in digital teaching and learning that can be used as an assessment tool in different professional settings.

Inspite of extensive research efforts and scientific advancements, the worldwide emergence of microbial tolerance continues to plague survivability. The innate property of microbe to resist any antibiotic due to evolution is the virtue of intrinsic resistance. However, the classical genetic mutations and extrachromosomal segments causing gene exchange attribute to acquired tolerance development. Rampant use of antimicrobials causes certain selection pressure which increases the resistance frequency. Genomic duplication, enzymatic site modification, target alteration, modulation in membrane permeability, and the efflux pump mechanism are the major contributors of multidrug resistance (MDR), specifically antibiotic tolerance development. MDRs will lead to clinical failures for treatment and pose health crisis. The molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are diverse as well as complex and still are exploited for new discoveries in order to prevent the surfacing of superbugs. Antimicrobial chemotherapy has diminished the threat of infectious diseases to some extent. To avoid the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, the new ones licensed for use have decreased with time.

This work determines whether the sensitivity of Ag-RDTs designed for nasal sampling is altered with use of self-administered throat swabs in self-perceived asymptomatic individuals. This investigation compared results of a common Ag-RDT (i.e. Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device) using three sampling sites: nasal swab; throat swab and; combined nasal/throat. All Ag-RDT results were confirmed with molecular testing. Compared to RT-PCR, samples from nasal or throat swabs each detected 64.5% of SARS-CoV-2 cases; however, combining the contributions of each swab increased sensitivity to 88.7%. This trend was also evident with the Rapid Response Ag-RDT (BTNX), which uses a more flexible swabs than Panbio. When nasal swab collection was compared to paired sampling of the nasal/throat using a single swab with the Panbio Ag-RDT, the sensitivity of each was 68.4% and 81.6%, respectively. No false-positive results were observed with nasal, throat, or combined nasal/throat sampling. Self-administered throat and nasal/throat swabs both had >90% acceptability.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 69-100%. Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for PE (6 [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and 2 [25%] by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy). In 2 (25%), CTA demonstrated a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (US and CT) included small volume ascites (6; 38%), hepatomegaly (6; 38%), echogenic kidneys (5; 31%), bowel wall thickening (3; 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3; 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2; 13%), splenomegaly (1; 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1; 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were: cardiomegaly (12; 75%), pleural effusion (10; 63%) and atelectasis (10; 63%). 15 patients (94%) were discharged home (length of hospital stay 3-20 days). There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, though also solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process.

Molecular adjuvants are a specific subclass of adjuvants where ligands of known immune-modulatory receptors are directly fused to an antigen. Co-stimulation of the B cell receptor (BCR) and immune-modulatory receptors through this strategy can augment downstream signaling to improve antibody titers and/or potency, and survival in challenge models. AREAS COVERED: C3d has been the most extensively studied molecular adjuvant and shown to improve immune responses to a number of antigens. Similarly, tumor necrosis superfamily ligands, such as BAFF and APRIL, as well as CD40, CD180 and immune complex ligands can also improve humoral immunity as molecular adjuvants. EXPERT OPINION: However, no single strategy has emerged that improves immune outcomes in all contexts. Thus, systematic exploration of molecular adjuvants that target B cell receptors will be required to realize their full potential as next-generation vaccine technologies.","output":"B cell targeting by molecular adjuvants for enhanced immunogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are one of the largest groups of positive-sense RNA virus families within the Nidovirales order, which are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has unleashed a global threat to public health and the economy. Coronaviruses are extensively present in birds and mammals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), being the reservoir for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 that seems to have resulted from a zoonotic spillover to the human host, causing respiratory infections, lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS). About six coronavirus serotypes are linked with the disease in humans, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh CoV to infect humans. We analyzed the genome sequence of CoV-2 from isolates derived from China as well from India and encountered minute variations in their sequence. A cladogram analysis revealed the predominant strain circulating in India belongs to the A2a clad. We took one such strain (MT012098) and performed a rigorous in-silico genotypic and antigenic analysis to identify its relatedness to other strains.

METHODS: We surveyed a sample (convenience sampling) of 5 groups of people: general population, people with epilepsy, people with diabetes mellitus (DM), people with cardiac problems, and people with psychiatric problems. The survey included 4 general questions (age, sex, education, and medical/psychiatric problem) and 4 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific questions (contracting COVID-19, relatives with COVID-19, wearing a face mask while in crowded places, and the frequency of daily hand washings). RESULTS: A total of 582 people (153 people with epilepsy, 127 patients with DM, 98 people with cardiac problems, 96 patients with psychiatric disorders, and 108 healthy individuals) participated. Twenty-eight (4.8%) people expressed that they do not wear a face mask when at crowded places. A lower education and less frequent daily hand washings had associations with mask wearing hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: Mask wearing hesitancy is a concern during a respiratory viral disease pandemic. Paying attention to personal variables, especially if they are modifiable (eg, education and hygiene), is probably productive and practical in promoting mask wearing culture.","output":"Mask Wearing Hesitancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the analysis of cumulative counts of SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as deaths or cases, common parametric models based on log-logistic growth curves adapt well to describe a single wave at a time.

One of the major benefits which favours this examination, is that this is a non-invasive, low-cost and radiation-free imaging modality which allows repeated imaging. LUS plays an important role in a wide range of pathologies, including cardiogenic oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and fibrosis. Specific LUS findings have proved useful and predictive of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is of particular relevance in the suspicion and monitoring of patients with lung disease. Furthermore, several studies have confirmed the role of LUS in the screening of interstitial lung diseases in connective tissue diseases. Given these data, LUS will likely play an important role in the management of COVID-19 patients from identification of specific abnormalities corresponding to definite pneumonia phases and CT scans findings. In addition, LUS could allow reduction in the exposure of health-care workers to potential infection.

Despite improved availability and coverage of home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (HBPM, ABPM), both are infrequently used to confirm diagnoses. We used the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework, a multi-step process for mapping barriers to theory-informed behavior change techniques, to develop a multi-component implementation strategy for increasing out-of-office BP testing for hypertension diagnosis. Informed by geographically diverse provider focus groups (n = 63) exploring barriers to out-of-office testing and key informant interviews (n = 12), a multi-disciplinary team (medicine, psychology, nursing) used rigorous mixed methods to develop, refine, locally adapt, and finalize intervention components. The purpose of this report is to describe the protocol of the Effects of a Multi-faceted intervention on Blood pRessure Actions in the primary Care Environment (EMBRACE) trial, a cluster randomized control trial evaluating whether a theory-informed multi-component strategy increased out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis. METHODS/DESIGN: The EMBRACE Trial patient sample will include all adults &#8805; 18 years of age with a newly elevated office BP (&#8805; 140/90 mmHg) at a scheduled visit with a primary care provider from a study clinic. All providers with scheduled visits with adult primary care patients at enrolled ACN primary care clinics were included. We determined that the most feasible, effective implementation strategy would include delivering education about out-of-office testing, demonstration/instruction on how to perform out-of-office HBPM and ABPM testing, feedback on completion rates of out-of-office testing, environmental prompts/cues via computerized clinical decision support (CDS) tool, and a culturally tailored, locally accessible ABPM testing service. We are currently comparing the effect of this locally adapted multi-component strategy with usual care on the change in the proportion of eligible patients who complete out-of-office BP testing in a 1:1 cluster randomized trial across 8 socioeconomically diverse clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The EMBRACE trial is the first trial to test an implementation strategy for improving out-of-office testing for hypertension diagnosis.

In addition, it maintains the ploidy level consistency in eukaryotic cells, hence, mutations or alteration of this protein could result in the disintegration of the fine-tuned molecular machinery that can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Moreover, MCM2 has been found to be an important marker for progression and prognosis in different cancers. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the MCM2 expression and the associated outcome in breast cancer (BC) patients based on the publicly available online databases. In this study, server-based gene expression analyses indicate the upregulation of MCM2 (p < 10(?6); fold change>2.0) in various BC subtypes as compared to the respective normal tissues. Besides, the evaluation of histological sections from healthy and cancer tissues showed strong staining signals indicating higher expression of MCM2 protein. The overexpression of MCM2 was significantly correlated to promoter methylation and was related to patients' clinical features. Further, mutation analysis suggested missense as the predominant type of mutation (71.4%) with 18 copy-number alterations and 0.2% mutation frequency in the MCM2 gene. This study revealed a significant correlation (Cox p  0.05) between the higher MCM2 expression and lower patient survival. Finally, we identified the co-expressed genes with gene ontological features and signaling pathways associated in BC development.

Analyses were stratified by patient demographic characteristics, patient outcomes, treatments, time, and comorbidities. RESULTS Controlling for inflation, there was no difference in SLNI total costs between 2005 and either 2007 or 2010, suggesting that while SLNI provided an increased level of services, any additional expenditures were offset by efficiencies. SLNI total costs were slightly lower than published benchmarks. Consistent with previous stroke care cost estimates, the median overall differential between total hospital costs and payments for all ischemic stroke cases was negative. CONCLUSIONS SLNI total costs remained consistent over time and were slightly lower than previously published estimates, suggesting that a focused, streamlined stroke program can be implemented without a significant economic impact.

METHODS: We used a test-negative caseCcontrol design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the omicron and delta (B.1.617.2) variants in England. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated after primary immunization with two doses of BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and after a booster dose of BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. RESULTS: Between November 27, 2021, and January 12, 2022, a total of 886,774 eligible persons infected with the omicron variant, 204,154 eligible persons infected with the delta variant, and 1,572,621 eligible test-negative controls were identified. At all time points investigated and for all combinations of primary course and booster vaccines, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was higher for the delta variant than for the omicron variant. No effect against the omicron variant was noted from 20 weeks after two ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 doses, whereas vaccine effectiveness after two BNT162b2 doses was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9 to 67.0) at 2 to 4 weeks, dropping to 8.8% (95% CI, 7.0 to 10.5) at 25 or more weeks. Among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 62.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 63.0) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before decreasing to 39.6% (95% CI, 38.0 to 41.1) at 10 or more weeks. Among BNT162b2 primary course recipients, vaccine effectiveness increased to 67.2% (95% CI, 66.5 to 67.8) at 2 to 4 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster before declining to 45.7% (95% CI, 44.7 to 46.7) at 10 or more weeks. Vaccine effectiveness after a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 primary course increased to 70.1% (95% CI, 69.5 to 70.7) at 2 to 4 weeks after an mRNA-1273 booster and decreased to 60.9% (95% CI, 59.7 to 62.1) at 5 to 9 weeks. After a BNT162b2 primary course, the mRNA-1273 booster increased vaccine effectiveness to 73.9% (95% CI, 73.1 to 74.6) at 2 to 4 weeks; vaccine effectiveness fell to 64.4% (95% CI, 62.6 to 66.1) at 5 to 9 weeks.

A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials.

In this retrospective cohort study, we included adult in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 with definite outcomes (discharged hospital or deceased) from Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. We included 350 patients (205 males, 145 females) with a mean age of 63.24 years (SD = 17.4, range: 21C96 years). Seventy-two patients died in the hospital and 278 were discharged. The four most common comorbidities were hypertension (184, 52.6%), chronic cardiac disease (110, 31.4%), obesity (96, 27.8%) and diabetes (95, 27.1%). Ninety-three participants (26.6%) received a long-term prescription for FIASMAs. Among these, 60 (64.5%) received amlodipine.

However, the role of STAT3 in EV71 infection remains unknown. This study found that the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 (pY705-STAT3) are closely related to EV71 infection. Further experiments revealed that STAT3 exerts an anti-EV71 activity. However, the antiviral activity of STAT3 is partially antagonized by EV71-induced miR-124, which directly targets STAT3 mRNA. Similarly, IL-6R, the -subunit of the IL-6 receptor complex, exhibits anti-EV71 activity and is directly targeted by the virus-induced miR-124. These results indicate that EV71 can evade host IL-6R- and STAT3-mediated antiviral activities by EV71-induced miR-124.

RESULTS: Of 252 screened subjects, 17 (6.7%) had definite and 14 (5.5%) probable COVID-19. The percentage of PWE with definite COVID-19 was much higher than the percentage of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 in Polish general population (3.65%).

It was underestimated assuming no lag days from symptom onset to deaths while many CFR formulas have been proposed, the estimation on Bays theorem is worthy of interpretation. Hence, it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak (LSBHRS) may increase the CFR. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 14, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains information on confirmed cases in >30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The pros and cons were compared among the 5 formula of CFR, including [A] deaths/confirmed; [B] deaths/(deathsa+arecovered); [C] deaths/(cases x days ago); [D] Bayes estimation based on [A] and the outbreak (LSBHRS) in each country/region; and [E] Bayes estimation based on [C] deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CVa=athe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR across each region. RESULTS: The Bayes based on (A)[D] has the lowest CV (=0.10) followed by the deaths/confirmed (=0.11) [A], deaths/(deathsa+arecoveries) (=0.42) [B], Bayes based on (C) (=0.49) [E], and deaths/(cases x days ago) (=0.59) [C]. All final CFRs will be equal using the formula (from, A to E). A dashboard was developed for the daily reporting of the CFR. The CFR (3.7%) greater than the prior CFR of 2.2% was evident in LSBHRS, increasing the CFR. A dashboard was created to present the CFRs on COVID-19.

Specifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency constraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing the same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work, producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the learned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for embodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring real-world human demonstrations to a simulated robot, we find that XIRL is more sample efficient than current best methods.

Recently, it was found to be a potential medicine in the effective treatment of COVID-19. In addition to the positive effects of this API, genotoxic sodium azide is used in the synthesis of cilostazol that can appear in the API. In this work, a method was developed for the determination of sodium azide (as azide anion) in cilostazol API at 7.5 ppm limit level by using ion chromatography (IC) and liquidCliquid extraction (LLE) sample preparation. The liquidCliquid extraction allows the application of high sample concentrations. Because of the low limit concentration (7.5 ppm), 500 mg sample was dissolved in 5 mL solvent. By using LLE for sample preparation, the huge amount of cilostazol was omitted and column overload was avoided. The developed method was validated in accordance with the relevant guidelines. Specificity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection and limit of quantification parameters were evaluated. The calculated limit of detection was 0.52 ppm (S/N:3) and the limit of quantification was 1.73 ppm (S/N:10) for sodium azide.

Our aim is to evaluate children diagnosed with non-retentive fecal incontinence (NRFI) using 3D-HRAM. Methods In all children diagnosed with NRFI, manometric parameters and 3-dimensional reconstructions of the anal canal subdivided into 8 segments were recorded. All data were compared to raw data that were obtained from asymptomatic children, collected in our laboratory and published previously (C group). Results Forty children (31 male; median age, 8 years; range, 5-17) were prospectively included in the study. Comparison of the NRFI group and C group revealed lower values of mean resting pressure (74.4 mmHg vs 89.2 mmHg, P > 0.001) and maximum squeeze pressure (182 mmHg vs 208.5 mmHg, P = 0.018) in the NRFI group. In the NRFI group, the thresholds of sensation, urge and discomfort (40 cm3, 70 cm3, and 140 cm3, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the C group (20 cm3, 30 cm3, and 85 cm3, respectively; P > 0.001). In the NRFI group, 62.5% presented a mean resting pressure above the fifth percentile, and 82.5% of patients presented a maximum squeeze pressure above the fifth percentile. The comparisons between segments obtained from these patients and those obtained from the C group revealed several segments with significantly decreased pressure values in the NRFI group. Conclusions Our study demonstrated lower pressure parameters in children with NRFI. In patients with normal resting pressures, 3D-HRAM may reveal segments with decreased pressures, which may play a potential role in the pathomechanism of incontinence.","output":"Three-dimensional High-resolution Anorectal Manometry in Children With Non-retentive Fecal Incontinence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the complex boundaries between 'fake news', speculation, hypothesis, gossip and whistleblowing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Effective assessment of biomarker performances are needed to evaluate their clinical usefulness and translation. We defined a realistic ground-truth scenario and compared the effectiveness of different biomarkers alone and combined to localize epileptogenic tissue during surgery. We investigated the performances of univariate, bivariate and multivariate signal biomarkers applied to 1 min inter-ictal intra-operative electrocorticography to discriminate between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic locations in 47 drug-resistant people with epilepsy (temporal and extra-temporal) who had been seizure-free one year after the operation. The best result using a single biomarker was obtained using the phase-amplitude coupling measure for which the epileptogenic tissue was localized in 17 out of 47 patients. Combining the whole set of biomarkers provided an improvement of the performances: 27 out of 47 patients. Repeating the analysis only on the temporal-lobe resections we detected the epileptogenic tissue in 29 out of 30 combining all the biomarkers. We suggest that the assessment of biomarker performances on a ground-truth scenario is required to have a proper estimate on how biomarkers translate into clinical use. Phase-amplitude coupling seems the best performing single biomarker and combining biomarkers improves localization of epileptogenic tissue.

METHODS: Anonymous surveys were emailed to members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on gynecologic oncology care in terms of alterations to normal treatment patterns and anticipated challenges were assessed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine risk factors for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of 331 gynecologic oncology providers. COVID-19 is present in 99.1% of surveyed communities with 99.7% reporting mitigation efforts in effect. The infection rate differs significantly between regions (p?0.001) with the Northeast reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Practice volume has dropped by 61.6% since the start of the pandemic with most cancellations being provider initiated. A majority of responders (52.8%) believed that ovarian cancer will be the most affected cancer by COVID-19. >94% of responders are proceeding with gynecologic cancer surgeries with exception of grade 1, endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (36.3%).

Even so, frailty has not been considered in studies of COVID-19 vaccines to date, leading to concerns that the vaccines have not been optimally tailored for and evaluated in this population even as vaccination programs are being implemented.

Tracing trends and events with the potential to alter drug futures are seen as ways of becoming more prepared. This challenge is made complex in fast evolving drug markets which entangle with shifting social and material relations at global scale. In this analysis, we argue that drugs policy research orientates to detection and discovery based on the recent past. This narrows future-oriented analyses to the predictable and probable, imagined as extensions of the immediate and local present. We call for a more speculative approach; one which extends beyond the proximal, and one which orientates to possibilities rather than probabilities. Drawing on ideas on speculation from science and technology and futures studies, we argue that speculative research holds potential for more radical alterations in drugs policy. We encourage research approaches which not only valorise knowing in relation to what might happen but which conduct experiments on what could be. Accordingly, we trace how speculative research makes a difference by altering the present through making deliberative interventions on alternative policy options, including policy scenarios which make a radical break with the present.

Objective This study aimed to assess the reach and effectiveness of the programmatic changes instituted by WA WIC during the COVID-19 pandemic; the processes, facilitators, and challenges involved in their implementation; and considerations for their continuation in the future. Design A mixed-methods design, guided by the RE-AIM framework, including virtual, semi-structured focus groups and interviews with WA WIC staff and WA WIC participants, and quantitative programmatic data from WIC agencies across the state. Participants/Setting: This study included data from 52 state and local WIC staff and 40 WIC participants across the state of Washington and from various WA WIC programmatic records (2017-2021); The research team collected data and conducted analyses between January 2021 and August 2021. Analysis An inductive thematic analysis approach with Dedoose was used to code qualitative data, generate themes, and interpret qualitative data. Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative programmatic data, including total participant count, percent increase and decrease in participation, percent of food benefits redeemed monthly, and appointment completion rates. Results All WA WIC participants (n= 125,279 in May 2020) experienced the programmatic changes. Participation increased by 2% March to December 2020, after WA WIC adopted programmatic changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain. Refocusing policy priorities from disease control to prevention will improve international coordination efforts in pandemic prevention. Implementing such proactive actions will cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets. However, the expected benefits of the food-safety approach will include preventing global economic losses due to pandemics.","output":"Pandemics and food systems - towards a proactive food safety approach to disease prevention & management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EP2, a G-protein-coupled prostaglandin-E2 receptor, has emerged as a seminal biological target for drug discovery. EP2 receptor activation is typically proinflammatory; therefore, the development of EP2 antagonists to mitigate the severity and disease pathology in a variety of inflammation-driven central nervous system and peripheral disorders would be a novel strategy. We have recently developed a second-generation EP2 antagonist TG8-260 and shown that it reduces hippocampal neuroinflammation and gliosis after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in rats.

TG8-260 (2f) showed Schild K B = 13.2 nM (3.6-fold more potent than the previous lead TG8-69 (1c)) and 500-fold selectivity to EP2 against other prostanoid receptors. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that TG8-260 has a plasma half-life of 2.14 h (PO) and excellent oral bioavailability (77.3%). Extensive ADME tests indicated that TG8-260 is a potent inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. Further, we show that TG8-260 displays antagonistic activity on the induction of EP2 receptor-mediated inflammatory gene expression in microglia BV2-hEP2 cells; therefore, it can serve as a tool for investigating anti-inflammatory pathways in peripheral inflammatory disease animal models.","output":"Second-Generation Prostaglandin Receptor EP2 Antagonist, TG8-260, with High Potency, Selectivity, Oral Bioavailability, and Anti-Inflammatory Properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from the Hubei province in China in late 2019 demonstrates the epidemic potential of coronaviruses.

In this study, it was aimed to determine the risk assessment and the factors associated with risk status of an university hospital healthcare workers after risky COVID-19 contact. The data of the descriptive study were obtained from 773 follow-up records of 555 healthcare workers who applied with COVID-19 risky contact between 06.04-10.05.2020. Employees who were positive for RT-PCR evaluated as \\"patients\\" and others as \\"risky contact\\". Risk assessment was classified as no risk, low, medium and high risk contact according to the \\"Algorithm of Assessment of Health Workers with COVID-19 Contact\\" of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between the risk levels of the participants and their demographic and workplace characteristics and their usage of personal protection were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the data. The average age of the healthcare workers was determined as 34.4  7.6 years. It was determined that 56.2% of those who had contact were female, 62.9% were married and 17.5% had an additional disease. It was determined that 45.6% of the risky contacts were nurses, 18.4% were supportive personnel and 16.9% were doctors. While 46.5% of the contacts were found as medium, 28.0% low, 17.1% high risk and 8.4% risk free. 38.2% of risky contacts occurred while working in internal/surgical clinics. While 66.0% of the employees had risky contact during patient care and treatment, 25% had risky contact with colleagues in social settings. High-risk contact was higher in social relations between employees. The source of the contact was a colleague in 73.2% of the employees. The average age of high-risk employees was smaller than those of low-risk. While 54.5% of the employees wore surgical masks during contact, 67.8% of the patients did not have a mask. Of 555 employees followed, 37 (6.7%) were diagnosed as COVID-19; 48.6% of the patients were nurses and 18.9% were doctors. It was determined that 48.6% of the healthcare workers were working in the COVID-19 service, outpatient clinic or intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. The source of the infection was thought to be a colleague in 51.6% of the patients. COVID-19 was more common in nurses and doctors. It was determined that risky contact also occurred in services other than the units where COVID-19 patients were treated and risky contact often took place while providing healthcare to the patients and during social relations between the employees. Unprotected contact of the employees with each other in the workplace was identified as an important risk source. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers led to an increase in medium and high risk contacts. The use of masks by patients and their relatives during the health service delivery and the proper use of personal protective equipment by healthcare professionals will reduce the risk. With the physical improvement of the rest areas of the employees and the arrangement of the breaks, the risky contact between colleagues in the social areas will be reduced.","output":"[Assessment of COVID-19 Risky Contact of Healthcare Workers in an University Hospital]./ Bir niversite Hastanesindeki Saglik ?alisanlarinin COVID-19 Riskli Temas Durumlarinin Degerlendirilmesi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim Healthcare utilization of the population changed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Patients older than 18-years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Dokuz Eyll University Hospital-Turkey in November and December 2020 (n = 3597) were included in this retrospective cohort study. In total, data from 2978 patients were analyzed. Data were collected through telephone interviews. Dependent variables were patient-reported general healthcare use and COVID-19 related healthcare use within 3 months of follow-up. Age, gender, chronic disease history, number of initial symptoms, and hospitalization status were independent variables. Chi-square was used to compare categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate (backward elimination method) logistic regression models were conducted to identify predictive factors. Results In total, 32% of the cases sought healthcare within three months of diagnosis while 11.4% of the visits were due to COVID-19. The most common outpatient visits related to COVID-19 included chest diseases (30.3%), the emergency room (29.1%), and internal medicine (16.2%).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at four hospitals from March 2020 to January 2021 to evaluate lung POCUS and clinical outcomes of COVID\\\\19. Inclusion criteria included adult patients hospitalized for COVID\\\\19 who received lung POCUS with a 12\\\\zone protocol. Each image was interpreted by two reviewers blinded to clinical outcomes. Our primary outcome was the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission versus no ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included intubation and supplemental oxygen usage. RESULTS: N = 160 patients were included. Among critically ill patients, B\\\\lines (94 vs 76%; P < .01) and consolidations (70 vs 46%; P < .01) were more common. For scans collected within 24 hours of admission (N = 101 patients), early B\\\\lines (odds ratio [OR] 4.41 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.71C14.30]; P < .01) or consolidations (OR 2.49 [95% CI: 1.35C4.86]; P < .01) were predictive of ICU admission. Early consolidations were associated with oxygen usage after discharge (OR 2.16 [95% CI: 1.01C4.70]; P = .047).

Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying its protective action remains to be fully elucidated. Recently, increased attention has been focused on Notch1 signalling for ameliorating cardiac ischaemic injury. Here, we hypothesised that oestrogen receptor  activation attenuates myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac damage by modulating the Notch1 signalling pathway. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish an MI model through the ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Two chemical drugs, 2,3-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a specific inhibitor of Notch1 signalling) were administered via intraperitoneal injection to change oestrogen receptor  and Notch1 activities. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) assessment and echocardiography were used in this study to analyse cardiac oxidative stress, apoptosis, infraction volume, fibrosis and cardiac function. RESULTS: DPN-mediated oestrogen receptor  activation effectively protected cardiomyocytes from MI-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, oestrogen receptor  activation reduced the infarct size and lowered the levels of myocardial enzymes in the serum, thereby leading to greater overall cardiac function improvement. Ischaemic injuryCinduced myocardial fibrosis was attenuated by oestrogen receptor  activation. Nevertheless, all of these cardioprotective effects of oestrogen receptor  activation were almost abrogated by DAPT administration, i.e. DAPT attenuated the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects and the decrease in infarct and fibrotic areas and reversed cardiac functional recovery. The levels of phospho-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-protein kinase B (Akt) were increased after DPN administration, and this change was reversed after DAPT was administered. CONCLUSIONS: All of these new findings indicate that oestrogen receptor  activation is effective in ameliorating MI-induced cardiac dysfunction by enhancing Notch1 signalling and that PI3K/Akt signalling is the downstream mediator.

Respiratory PCR samples and COVID-19 samples were taken simultaneously. Only RSV positive and COVID-19 positive infants were compared. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic information system medical records. The chest radiographs at the admission were evaluated by using standard definitions for normal chest X-ray, atelectasis, bronchopenumonia, peribronchial thickening and hyperinflation in various lung volumes. RESULTS A total of 30 infants were enrolled in the study and RSV was identified in 20/30 infants (66%). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of general characteristics. Comparing to the infants with Covid-19 infections, infants with RSV infections had significantly higher rates of having oxygen support (p = .03). Total NICU duration time was 6.7  1.6 days in COVID positive group and 11.1  5.1 days in the RSV group (p = .01). Infants with COVID-19 had more normal chest X-rays.

Per-capita user-reported SARS-CoV-2 positive tests closely matched government-reported per-capita case counts in provinces with high user engagement. DISCUSSION: The COVID Radar app allows voluntarily self-reporting of COVID-19 related symptoms and social distancing behaviors. Symptoms and risk behavior increase prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and user-reported case counts match closely with nationally-reported case counts in regions with high user engagement. These results suggest the COVID Radar may be a valid instrument for future surveillance and potential predictive analytics to identify emerging hotspots.","output":"COVID RADAR app: Description and validation of population surveillance of symptoms and behavior in relation to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we further observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore \`probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for \`exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\\\\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_1$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance.

In sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), several prioritizations of zoonoses and transboundary animal diseases (TADs) have been implemented at different scales to characterize potential disease impacts. Method and principal findings: In this systematic review, we analyze the methodologies used, outcomes, and their relevance by discussing criteria required to align decision-makers perceptions of impacts to those of other stakeholders for different prioritization in SSA. In general, the sectorial representativeness of stakeholders for processes implemented with the support of international partners showed slight differences with the absence of local stakeholders. Whatever the tool prioritized, zoonoses were similar in general because of the structured nature of those tools in assessing decision-makers preferences through value trade-offs between criteria while ensuring transparency and reproducibility. However, by involving field practitioners and farmers, there were different outcomes with processes concerning only decision makers and experts who were more sensitive to infectious TADs, while the former raised parasitic disease constraints. In this context, multicriteria decision analysis-based zoonoses and TADs prioritizations involving a balanced participation of stakeholders might contribute to bridging these divergences, whatever the scale.

METHODS: Prospective cohorts of 3,975 healthcare personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing during December 14 2020--April 10 2021. Self-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs were tested by qualitative and quantitative reverse-transcription--polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). VE was calculated as 100%x (1-hazard ratio); adjusted VE was calculated using vaccination propensity weights and adjustments for site, occupation, and local virus circulation . RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 (5.1%) participants; 16 were partially ([]14 days post-dose-1 to 13 days after dose-2) or fully ([]14 days post-dose-2) vaccinated, and 156 were unvaccinated; 32 with indeterminate status (<14 days after dose-1) were excluded. Adjusted mRNA VE of full vaccination was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]=76%--97%) against symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection; VE of partial vaccination was 81% (95% CI=64%-90%). Among partially or fully vaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean viral RNA load (Log10 copies/mL) was 40% lower (95% CI=16%-57%), the risk of self-reported febrile COVID-19 was 58% lower (Risk Ratio=0.42, 95% CI=0.18-0.98), and 2.3 fewer days (95% CI=0.8-3.7) were spent sick in bed compared to unvaccinated infected participants.

METHODS: A retrospective survey on consecutive patients (n = 63) was conducted over the telephone by independent interviewers. Group I (n = 36) consisted of patients who had telephone consultations and Group II (n = 27) of patients who had face-to-face appointments. Patient satisfaction was recorded using the Generic Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (G-MISS) questionnaire as it has been validated for use in General Surgery. Statistical analysis was performed to assess for any differences between the two groups in the cumulative satisfaction scores and the three dimensions of the G-MISS questionnaire, relief, compliance and communication. RESULTS: Median, Q1-Q3 of the satisfaction score in Group I (77.3, 62.1-93.3) did not statistically differ compared with Group II (76.5, 62.5-93.3, p = 0.91).

However, not every patient who is admitted requires close monitoring or specific therapeutics. Mild cases could be managed in the outpatient setting. OBJECTIVE Our study aimed to analyze the accuracy of the oxygen saturation/respiratory rate (sat/RR) index, NEWS2, CURB65, and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores to predict supplemental oxygen requirement and prolonged hospital stay in patients with mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS A prospective cohort study in an academic medical center. We compared the values of these scores according to the occurrence or not of each outcome. When differences between groups were statistically significant, the discriminatory capacity of the score for that outcome was analyzed. RESULTS We included 271 patients. Of them, 11.07% required supplemental oxygen, showing significantly higher values of NEWS2 score and qSOFA score, and lower values of Sat/RR index. About 38% presented prolonged hospital stay, with significantly higher values of NEWS2 score and lower values of sat/RR index. The ROC curve area under the curve (AUC) of sat/RR index to discriminate the requirement of supplemental oxygen was 0.72 (CI 95% 0.61-0.84). The ROC curve of NEWS2 and qSOFA for the same outcome was 0.75 (95% [95% CI 0.65-0.85]) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.76), respectively. The ability of the Sat/RR index to discriminate the requirement of prolonged hospitalization showed an AUC of 0.67 (95% [95% CI 0.60- 0.73]). The NEWS2 score showed an AUC of 0.63 (CI 95% 0.56-0.70) for the same outcome.

This paper emphasizes the importance of industrial structure for a regions resistance to the recessionary shock. Two significant factors that may determine the regional industrial structures in this ongoing recession include the relative composition of essential/non-essential sectors and the intensity of face-to-face interactions. Considering these factors, we focus on two groups of industries: essential industry with low interpersonal interactions and non-essential industry with high interpersonal interactions. The specialization in these industries is associated with the regional economic resistance to the COVID-19 induced recession. Estimation results from the ordinal logistic regression models show that essential industries with low interpersonal interactions, especially the retail and service sectorsCCfor instance, non-store retailers and financial and professional serviceCCare significantly related to regional economic resistance, and their relationship intensifies compared to other sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, states specialized in the non-essential industries with high interpersonal interactions are less likely to resist economically during the lockdown-COVID and until the stabilizing-COVID period. In addition, a state that quickly recovered from the 2001 recession is more likely to resist the pandemic shock during early- and lockdown-COVID periods.

Despite a plethora of information on the internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patients' resistance and compliance. It is not clear whether volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of resistance-compliance imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and imputed pH. METHODS: Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control and volume control ventilation modes. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in resistance and compliance (6 pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, EELV, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS: Depending on differences in resistance and compliance, differences in VT ranged from 1% (with equal resistance and compliance) to 79%. Differences in EELV ranged from 2% to 109%, whereas differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive VT (ie, > 8 mL/kg) did not occur, but failure due to excessive EELV difference (ie, > 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between volume control and pressure control ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the 2 patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP.

As a consequence, viral capsids have developed astonishing mechanical properties that are crucial for viral function. These remarkable properties have started to be unveiled in single-virus nanoindentation experiments, and are opening the door to the use of viral-derived artificial nanocages for promising bio- and nano-technological applications. However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a Virtual AFM (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsids structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.","output":"Viral nanomechanics with a virtual atomic force microscope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review Cytokine storm caused by viral respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 results in failure of human organs The mechanism of the cytokine storm, indications of plasma exchange, effects of the plasma exchange and application of plasma exchange in treatment of viral respiratory infectious diseases were reviewed","output":"Effect of plasma exchange for cytokine storm treatment of viral respiratory infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wireless sensors networks (WSNs) are characterized by flexibility and scalability in any environment. These networks are increasingly used in agricultural and industrial environments and have a dual role in data collection from sensors and transmission to a monitoring system, as well as enabling the management of the monitored environment. Environment management depends on trust in the data collected from the surrounding environment, including the time of data creation. This paper proposes a trust model for monitoring humidity and moisture in agricultural and industrial environments. The proposed model uses a digital signature and public key infrastructure (PKI) to establish trust in the data source, i.e., the trust in the sensor. Trust in data generation is essential for real-time environmental monitoring and subsequent analyzes, thus timestamp technology is implemented here to further ensure that gathered data are not created or changed after the assigned time. Model validation is performed using the Castalia network simulator by testing energy consumption at the receiver and sender nodes and the delay incurred by creating or validating a trust token. In addition, validation is also performed using the Ascertia TSA Crusher application for the time consumed to obtain a timestamp from the free TSA. The results show that by applying different digital signs and timestamps, the trust entity of the WSN improved significantly with an increase in power consumption of the sender node by up to 9.3% and receiver node by up to 126.3% for a higher number of nodes, along with a packet delay of up to 15.6% and an average total time consumed up to 1.186 s to obtain the timestamp from the best chosen TSA, which was as expected.","output":"Trustworthy Wireless Sensor Networks for Monitoring Humidity and Moisture Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread and have grave health and socioeconomic consequences worldwide.

Study designSurvey MethodsRoutine public health surveillance identified a marked increase in the numbers of University of Cambridge students with respiratory illness and SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the 10 days after a national lockdown was announced in the UK on 5 November 2020. Cases were identified both through symptom-triggered testing and a universal asymptomatic testing program. An online questionnaire was sent to all University of Cambridge students on 25 November to investigate risk factors for testing positive in the period after 30th October 2020. This asked about symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, in-person teaching settings, other aspects of University life, and attendance at social events in the period just prior to lockdown, from 30th October and 4th November 2020. Univariate and multivariable analyses were undertaken evaluating potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 positivity. ResultsAmong 3,980 students responding to the questionnaire, 99 (2.5%) reported testing SARS-CoV-2 positive in the period studied; 28 (28%) were asymptomatic. We found strong independent associations with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were attendance at two social settings in the City of Cambridge (adjusted odds ratio favouring disease 13.0 (95% CI 6.2,26.9) and 14.2 (95% CI 2.9,70)), with weaker evidence of association with three further social settings. By contrast, we did not observe strong independent associations between disease risk and type of accommodation or attendance at, or participation in, a range of activities associated with the University curriculum. ConclusionsAttendance at social settings can facilitate widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission in University students.

We analyzed correlations between serum and urinary CC16, CC16 levels and Wainwright score, immediate morbidity due to bronchiolitis, causal viruses, and recurrent wheezing 1 year after inclusion. In 166 infants, serum CC16 did not correlate with acute bronchiolitis severity (P = .49), but urinary CC16 did (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, urinary CC16 correlated mainly with urinary retinol binding protein (RBP; r = 0.70; P < .001). The logCC16u/logRBPu ratio correlated significantly with severity (P = .02). CC16 levels were not correlated with recurrent wheezing at 1 year. Urinary CC16 could be a useful biomarker in acute bronchiolitis for specific indications.

This study aimed to share the learning experience of an oral pathology laboratory course using either the virtual microscopy with digitalized virtual slides (virtual slide learning) or real microscopy using traditional glass slides (glass slide learning) among dental students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight undergraduate dental students who took the compulsory course entitled oral pathology in the School of Dentistry, National Taiwan University were included in this study. The questionnaires were filled and final test was taken by these students after finishing the teaching of oral pathology laboratory course using either virtual or glass slide learning. The data were collected and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Our results showed a significantly higher acceptance rate (all P-values < 0.001) and a significantly better histopathological diagnosis ability (P < 0.01) among dental students using the virtual slide learning than those using the glass slide learning for the oral pathology laboratory course. CONCLUSION: Virtual microscopy has many advantages over real microscopy in oral pathology laboratory course teaching. Based on the results of our study, we believe that the virtual microscopy with digitalized virtual slides may gradually replace the real microscopy with glass slides for the learning of oral pathology laboratory course.

The observation function plays a critical role in the EnKF framework, connecting the unknown system variables with the observed data.

In this work, we present a novel computational analysis demonstrating the effects of observation function selection when using the EnKF for state and parameter estimation in this setting. In examining the use of four epidemiologically-inspired observation functions of different forms in connection with the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, we show how incorrect observation modeling assumptions (i.e., fitting incidence data with a prevalence model, or neglecting under-reporting) can lead to inaccurate filtering estimates and forecast predictions. Results demonstrate the importance of choosing an observation function that well interprets the available data on the corresponding EnKF estimates in several filtering scenarios, including state estimation with known parameters, and combined state and parameter estimation with both constant and time-varying parameters.

METHODS: Thirty individuals between the ages of 18C45, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR at least one month ago, and had no pre-COVID-19 hearing loss complaints, constituted the test group. Thirty individuals aged between 18 and 30 years and who had no history of hearing loss constituted the control group. Audiological evaluations of all participants were made with pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements.

Simulations were used to investigate the relative reduction in mortality and morbidity of vaccinate allocation strategies based on prioritizing different age groups, and the interactions of these strategies with several concurrent non-pharmacologic interventions (i.e., social distancing, mandated masks, lockdowns). Given the uncertainty associated with current COVID-19 vaccine development, we also varied several vaccine characteristics (i.e., efficacy, type of immunity conferred, and rollout speed) in the modelling simulations. Results: In nearly all scenarios, prioritizing COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older populations (i.e., >60yrs old) led to the greatest relative reduction in deaths, regardless of vaccine efficacy, control measures, rollout speed, or immunity dynamics. However, preferential vaccination of this target group often produced higher total symptomatic infection counts and more pronounced estimates of peak incidence than strategies which targeted younger adults (i.e., 20-40yrs or 40-60yrs) or the general population irrespective of age. Vaccine efficacy, immunity type, target coverage and rollout speed all significantly influenced overall strategy effectiveness, with the time taken to reach target coverage significantly affecting the relative mortality benefit comparative to no vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings support global recommendations to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation for older age groups. Including younger adults in the prioritisation group can reduce overall infection rates, although this benefit was countered by the larger mortality rates in older populations. Ultimately an optimal vaccine allocation strategy will depend on vaccine characteristics, strength of concurrent non-pharmaceutical interventions, and region-specific goals such as reducing mortality, morbidity, or peak incidence.","output":"Comparing COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategies in India: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) undergoes rapid inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) suggesting that target receptors may be activated by locally produced GLP-1.

MethodsWe performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and determined the impact of the Lambda variant on infectivity and immune escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from two centers in Santiago, Chile who received the two-doses scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac. ResultsWe observed an increased infectivity mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the Alpha variant. ConclusionsOur results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac.

METHODS: All the epidemiological data used in this study were collected manually from the official website of the Yangzhou Municipal Health Committee from 28 July to 26 August 2021, and then were analyzed systematically and statistically in this study. RESULTS: A total of 570 COVID-19 cases were reported during the short-term outbreak in Yangzhou City. The ages of infected individuals ranged from 1 to 90 years with the average age at 49.47  22.69 years. As for gender distributions, the ratio of male- to-female patients was 1:1.36 (242:328). Geographic analysis showed that 377 patients (66.1%) were in Hanjiang District while 188 patients (33.0%) were in Guangling District. Clinical diagnosis showed that 175 people (30.7%) had mild symptoms, 385 people were in moderate conditions (67.5%), and 10 people were in severe situations (1.8%). Significant age differences were found among the three groups (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was identified in terms of gender ratio (P > 0.05). Based on the transmission chain formed by 6 generations of infected persons with a clear transmission relationship, the age showed a gradually decreasing trend, while the median time of diagnosis in 2 adjacent generations was 3 days. In addition, the estimated basic reproduction number R(0) of the Delta variant was 3.3651 by the classical Susceptible, Infectious, and/or Recovered (SIR) model.

An accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential for the treatment and control of the disease. The use of computed tomography (CT) has shown to be promising for evaluating patients suspected of COVID-19 infection. The analysis of a CT examination is complex, and requires attention from a specialist. This paper presents a methodology for detecting COVID-19 from CT images. We first propose a convolutional neural network architecture to extract features from CT images, and then optimize the hyperparameters of the network using a tree Parzen estimator to choose the best parameters. Following this, we apply a selection of features using a genetic algorithm. Finally, classification is performed using four classifiers with different approaches. The proposed methodology achieved an accuracy of 0.997, a kappa index of 0.995, an AUROC of 0.997, and an AUPRC of 0.997 on the SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan dataset, and an accuracy of 0.987, a kappa index of 0.975, an AUROC of 0.989, and an AUPRC of 0.987 on the COVID-CT dataset, using our CNN after optimization of the hyperparameters, the selection of features and the multi-layer perceptron classifier. Compared with pretrained CNNs and related state-of-the-art works, the results achieved by the proposed methodology were superior.

Dumping syndrome is an expected and desired part of the behavior modification caused by gastric bypass surgery; it can deter patients from consuming energy-dense food. In this study we assessed the role dumping has in weight loss and its relationship with the patient's eating behavior. METHODS Fifty patients who underwent gastric bypass between January 2008 and June 2008 were enrolled. Two questionnaires, the dumping syndrome questionnaire and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), were used to record the patients' responses. The diagnosis of dumping syndrome was based on the Sigstad scoring system, where a score of 7 and above was considered positive. TFEQ evaluated the patients' eating behavior under three scales: cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. The results were analyzed with descriptive and parametric statistics where applicable. RESULTS The prevalence of dumping syndrome was 42 %, with 66.7 % of the subjects being women. The nondumpers were observed to have a greater mean decrease in body mass index than the dumpers at 1 and 2 years (18.5 and 17.8 vs. 14.4 and 13.7 respectively). There was no definite relationship between the presence of dumping syndrome and the eating behavior of the patient. However, the cognitive restraint scores, greater than 80 %, were associated with an average decrease in BMI of 19 and 20.8 at 1 and 2 years compared with 14.6 and 12.4 in those with scores less than 80 % (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively).

We aimed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities and medications in addition to determining the association between AKI, antibiotics against coinfections (AAC) and outcomes of patients. We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Our primary outcomes were the incidence rate of AKI based on comorbidities and medications. The secondary outcome was to determine mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospitalization by AKI and AAC. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression method was used to explore predictive effects of AKI and AAC on outcomes. Out of 854 included participants, 118 patients developed AKI in whom, 57 used AAC and 61 did not. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities in patients developed AKI.

Aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND RESULTS: in this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 COVID-19 patients admitted to dedicated COVID-19 medical units. Hs-Troponin was assessed in n = 103 patients and NP in n = 82 patients on admission; subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38% and 56% of the cases respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and D-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP only (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03 respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and D-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B=-0.212, p = 0.013 and B = 0.179, p = 0.037 respectively), and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001 and B = 0.253, p = 0.001 respectively). In patients with in-hospital mortality (n = 23, 21%) hs-Troponin and NP were both higher (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively), while increasing hs-troponin and NP were associated with worse in-hospital prognosis [OR 4.88 (95% CI 1.9-12.2), p = 0.001 (adjusted OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.2-8.5), p = 0.025) and OR 4.67 (95% CI 2-10.8), p < 0.001 (adjusted OR 2.89 (95% CI 1.1-7.9), p = 0.04) respectively]. Receiver operator characteristic curves showed good ability of hs-Troponin and NP in predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.869 p < 0.001 and AUC = 0.810, p < 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia and associated to worse prognosis, suggesting a role for cardiac biomarkers assessment in COVID-19 risk stratification. Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point towards existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting.","output":"265 Incidence, determinants and prognostic relevance of HS-troponin and natriuretic peptides elevation at admission in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: High-sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) and N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are known markers of cardiac injury. However, the role of these markers in predicting severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains to be investigated. Objectives: To analyze an association between hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, with emphasis on those with concomitant chronic heart failure (CHF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1,729 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Demographic data, laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes (discharged or death) were analyzed. ROC curves and logistic regression analyses for hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP values and the risk of death were performed. RESULTS: Hs-cTnT was determined in 1,041 patients, while NT-proBNP was assessed in 715. CHF was present in 179 cases (10.4% of the cohort). The median of hs-cTnT, NT-proBNP values and in-hospital mortality were higher in CHF patients in comparison to those without CHF. In patients without CHF, the mortality was highest in those with the 4 th quartile of hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP values. In the ROC analysis, hs-cTnT  142 ng/ml, and NT-proBNP  969 pg/ml predicted in-hospital death. In cases without CHF, each 10 ng/L increase in hs-cTnT or 100 pg/mL increase in NT-proBNP was associated with risk of death: OR 1.01 and OR 1.02 (P<0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Hs-cTnT or NT-proBNP predicts in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Both Hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP should be routinely measured at admission in all patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 for early detection of subjects with an increased risk of in-hospital death, even if they do not have concomitant heart failure.","output":"Cardiac biomarkers on admission and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients with or without concomitant heart failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of COVID-19 has led to a wide range of pandemic response measures, heterogeneous between countries, varying mostly in time and duration of implementation.

Many of these studies are devoid of a methodological basis and semantic grounds because not enough time has passed for a fundamental understanding of what and how to study. For the correct understanding of the essence and real state of the social well-being of medical workers, a system of both internal and external control is required. Internal control is a key task of state health policy at the federal, regional, and municipal levels. External control is the prerogative of third-party public and scientific organizations capable of representing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of social processes in the health care sector, giving them a neutral and objective assessment. A rational form of external control is the sociological diagnosis of the effects of the pandemic, both for public health and for the social and mental health of certain professional groups. The task of modern sociology is to quantitatively and qualitatively measure components of social health of the professional medical community, the integral criterion of which is social well-being as a subjective perception and assessment by an individual medical worker of the level of their achievements, degree of realization of their needs, and the effectiveness of their life strategy, taking into account the sociocultural context (at the micro- and macrolevel) and objective factors (vectors of social policy of the state, situation in health care and public health, rhetoric of the mass media, and level of education in society). The concept of social well-being is closely related to the phenomenon of social adaptation. Merton's conceptual scheme of social adaptation (with a slight change in the sequence of types with an emphasis on the constructiveness of behavior models, rather than their anomalousness) is used to study the types of behavior of medical workers in a complex epidemiological situation. The theoretical significance of the typologization of social adaptation models is to reduce the conglomerate of behavioral acts and individual life worlds of medical workers to simplified scientific constructs for the correct understanding of the current situation and development of tools for social work with the professional medical community if there is a real need for them. The concept of social adaptation allows considering social well-being not as some kind of artificial objective reality, but as a dynamic characteristic of the actor's professional thinking.","output":"Social Well-being of the Professional Medical Community during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Rostov Oblast (based on the Materials of In-depth Interviews)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may increase transmissibility and/or cause escape from immune responses(1C3), there is an urgent need for the targeted surveillance of circulating lineages.

Forty-three NT1 patients completed a web-survey during Spring 2021 and were compared with 86 matched-controls. Statistical comparisons revealed that: (a) NT1 patients showed greater sleepiness than controls;(b) controls showed higher sleep disturbances than NT1 patients, and this result disappeared when the medication effect in NT1 was controlled;(c) NT1 patients reported higher lucid dream frequency than controls. Focusing on dreaming in NT1 patients, we found that (a) nightmare frequency was correlated with female gender, longer sleep duration, higher intrasleep wakefulness;(b) dream recall, nightmare and lucid dream frequency were positively correlated with sleepiness. Comparisons between low and high NT1 lucid dreamers showed that patients more frequently experiencing lucid dreams reported a greater influence of dreaming during wakefulness, especially concerning problem-solving and creativity. Overall, our results are consistent with previous studies on pandemic dreaming carried out on healthy subjects. Moreover, we confirmed a link between lucidity and creativity in NT1 patients.

Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective review evaluated the outcomes of 158,710 bottles collected between November 2018 and October 2019. The number of positive blood bottles was 13,592 (8.6%); 99% of positive aerobic and anaerobic bottles flagged positive by 91.5 and 108 h, respectively. The mean (median) times to positivity were 18.4 h (15.6 h) for Staphylococcus aureus, 12.3 h (9.5 h) for Escherichia coli, 22.2 h (15.9 h) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 48.9 h (42.9 h) for Candida spp. Only 175 bottles (0.1% of all bottles) flagged positive after 4 days of incubation; 89 (51%) of these bottles grew Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) species. Chart review of blood cultures positive after 4 days (96 h) rarely had a clinical impact and sometimes had a negative impact on patient care. Finally, a seeded study of the HACEK group (i.e., Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella), historically associated with delayed blood culture positivity, demonstrated no benefit to extended incubation beyond 4 days. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that a 4-day incubation time was sufficient for the Virtuo system and media. Implementation of the 4-day incubation time could enhance clinically relevant results by reducing recovery of contaminants and finalizing blood cultures 1 day earlier.","output":"Evaluation of Optimal Blood Culture Incubation Time To Maximize Clinically Relevant Results from a Contemporary Blood Culture Instrument and Media System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway induces innate immunity by activating the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Recently, studies revealed that self-DNA from by-products of chromosome instability and tumors could activate the cGAS-STING pathway, and subsequently promote or inhibit tumor development. However, the prognostic value and correlations with immune infiltrates of the cGAS-STING pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In the present study, we used the Molecular Signatures Database, Oncomine, UALCAN, Human Protein Atlas, Kaplan-Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource databases. Overexpression of XRCC5, IRF3, TRIM21, STAT6, DDX41, TBK1, XRCC6, TREX1, PRKDC, and TMEM173 was markedly correlated with clinical stages and pathological grades in HCC. Moreover, higher mRNA expression of XRCC5, XRCC6, and PRKDC was significantly related with shorter overall survival. However, higher mRNA expression of IFI16, STAT6, NLRC3, and TMEM173 was associated with favorable overall survival. Our results suggested that the kinase targets of the cGAS-STING pathway included the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (LCK and LYN), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family kinases (ATM and ATR), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). Furthermore, we identified significant correlations among the expression of cGAS-STING pathway and infiltration of B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in HCC. The expression of the cGAS-STING pathway also exhibited strong relationships with diverse immune marker sets in HCC.

In Greece, all sports activities were closed, and restrictions in public places could lead to a decrease in PA. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate how these restriction measures affected the frequency of physical activity, related to gender, age, body weight, and physical condition, in members of a Greek university. Results An online survey, which concerned sports activity prior the onset of SARS-CoV-2 virus and during the restriction measures, was conducted during the 2nd lockdown in Greece (November C December 2020). A questionnaire was sent to members of a Greek university. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, version 26. Frequencies, descriptive analysis, and chi square were calculated. The difference between, before, and during the period were accessed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. There was an increase of frequency in PA behavior during confinements compared with before the restrictions (p&lt;0.001). Females were more likely to participate in individual PA and in online exercise programs (n=316). Most of the responders chose to be involved in more than one form of PA during the confinements. The younger age group (18C25 years old) and older age group (55 +) exercised on a daily basis. In total, 41.9% of participants mentioned they intend to integrate exercise into their daily life when the restrictions eliminate. Conclusions The results are encouraging for participation in different types of PA, including online fitness programs.

The influenza virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since NS1 is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress NS1 function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another RNA virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between NS1 and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon mRNA induction during infection, which is known to be caused by NS1. In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of NS1 protein to inhibit double-stranded RNA-dependent activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to NS1, because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of NS1 can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.","output":"Novel influenza virus NS1 antagonists block replication and restore innate immune function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chest X-ray images are difficult to classify for the radiologists due to the noisy nature.

Our aim was to analyze the incidence, clinical presentation, and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, observational study. We contacted all the patients being treated at our IBD unit to identify those patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, following the World Health Organization case definition. Data were obtained by patient electronical medical records and by phone interview. RESULTS: Eighty-two of 805 patients with IBD (10.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3-12.5) were diagnosed as having confirmed (28 patients, 3.5%; 95% CI, 2.4-5.0) or suspected (54 patients, 6.7%) infection. Patient age was 46  14 years, 44 patients were female (53.7%), 17.3% were smokers, 51.2% had Crohn disease (CD), and 39.0% had comorbidities. Digestive symptoms were reported in 41 patients (50.0%), with diarrhea as the most common (42.7%). One patient (1.2%) was diagnosed with IBD flare-up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twenty-two patients (26.8%) temporarily withdrew from their IBD treatment because of COVID-19. Most of the patients had mild disease (79.3%), and 1 patient died (1.2%). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of dyspnea was associated with moderate to severe infection (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.6-17.7; P = 0.01) and myalgias (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3-17.9; P = 0.02) were related to a milder clinical course. Immunosuppression was not related to severity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD is not rare. Dyspnea is associated with a more severe infection. Therapy for IBD, including immunomodulators and biologic therapy, is not related to a greater severity of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infections do not appear to be related to IBD flare-ups.","output":"Incidence, Clinical Characteristics, and Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Single-Center Study in Madrid, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells [pDCs] represent a rare innate immune subset uniquely endowed with the capacity to produce substantial amounts of type-I interferons.

While IFN-I and select cytokines have been recognized as pDC secreted products, a comprehensive agnostic profiling of the pDC secretome in response to a physiologic stimulus has not been reported. We applied LC-MS/MS to catalogue the repertoire of proteins secreted by pDCs in the unperturbed condition and in response to challenge with influenza H1N1. We report the identification of a baseline pDC secretome, and the repertoire of virus-induced proteins including most type-I interferons, various cytokines, chemokines and granzyme B. Additionally, using single-cell RNA-seq [scRNA-seq], we perform multidimensional analyses of pDC transcriptional diversity immediately ex vivo and following stimulation. Our data evidence preexisting pDC heterogeneity, with subsequent highly specialized roles within the pDC population upon stimulation ranging from dedicated cytokine super-producers to cells with APC-like traits. Dynamic expression of transcription factors and surface markers characterize subclusters within activated pDCs.

Exposures Mean rank for change in 7 markers of economic prosperity between 2 time periods (baseline: 2007-2011 and follow-up: 2012-2016). A higher mean rank indicates a greater relative increase or lower relative decrease in prosperity (range, 5 to 92; mean [SD], 50 [14]). Main Outcomes and Measures Mean annual percentage change (APC) in age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the additional APC associated with a change in prosperity. Results Among 102 660 852 residents aged 40 to 64 years living in these counties in 2010 (51% women), 979 228 cardiovascular deaths occurred between 2010 and 2017.

Traditional indicators of biological age are not always informative and often require extensive and expensive analysis. The study of blood factors is a simple and easily accessible way to assess individual health and supplement the traditional indicators of a persons biological age with new objective criteria. With age, the processes of growth and development, tissue regeneration and repair decline; they are gradually replaced by enhanced catabolism, inflammatory cell activity, and insulin resistance. The number of senescent cells supporting the inflammatory loop rises; cellular clearance by autophagy and mitophagy slows down, resulting in mitochondrial and cellular damage and dysfunction.

Our analysis of social media data from early February and late March 2021 shows that, despite the overall strength of positive sentiment and despite the increasing numbers of Americans being fully vaccinated, negative sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines still persists among segments of people who are hesitant towards the vaccine. In this study, we perform sentiment analytics on vaccine tweets, monitor changes in public sentiment over time, contrast vaccination sentiment scores with actual vaccination data from the US CDC and the Household Pulse Survey (HPS), explore the influence of maturity of Twitter user-accounts and generate geographic mapping of tweet sentiments. We observe that fear sentiment remained unchanged in populous states, whereas trust sentiment declined slightly in these same states. Changes in sentiments were more notable among less populous states in the central sections of the US. Furthermore, we leverage the emotion polarity based Public Sentiment Scenarios (PSS) framework, which was developed for COVID-19 sentiment analytics, to systematically posit implications for public policy processes with the aim of improving the positioning, messaging, and administration of vaccines. These insights are expected to contribute to policies that can expedite the vaccination program and move the nation closer to the cherished herd immunity goal.","output":"Public Perceptions of COVID-19 Vaccines: Policy Implications from US Spatiotemporal Sentiment Analytics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though viruses have generally been characterized by their pathogenic and more generally harmful effects, many examples of mutualistic viruses exist. Here I explain how the idea of mutualistic viruses has been defended in recent virology, and I explore four important conceptual and practical consequences of this idea. I ask to what extent this research modifies the way scientists might search for new viruses, our notion of how the host immune system interacts with microbes, the development of new therapeutic approaches, and, finally, the role played by the criterion of autonomy in our understanding of living things. Overall, I suggest that the recognition of mutualistic viruses plays a major role in a wider ongoing revision of our conception of viruses.","output":"Mutualistic viruses and the heteronomy of life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly affected the psychological well-being of foreign residents. This study examines stress, anxiety, and depression levels in Chinese residents in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies risk factors and the roles of disaster preparedness and social support. An online survey among Chinese residents in Japan was conducted from 22 June to 14 July 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Disaster Preparedness for Resilience Checklist, and Social Support Rate Scale were used to measure psychological symptoms. Multivariable linear regressions identified the risk factors and positive effects of disaster preparedness and social support. Of the total 497 participants, 45.3%, 66.6%, and 54.3% reported severe stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. People with a lower level of education, a higher level of economic influence, the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, and confirmed or suspected family or friends in China were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first survey to reveal the protective role of disaster preparedness in reducing psychological symptoms during the pandemic. It offers unique data for further research on how to promote the mental health of vulnerable populations including foreign residents.","output":"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression for Chinese Residents in Japan during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Out-of-facility multi-month dispensing (MMD) is a differentiated service delivery model which provides antiretroviral treatment (ART) at intervals of up to six monthly in the community. Limited randomized evidence investigating out-of-facility MMD is available. We evaluated participant outcomes and compared out-of-facility MMD models using data from cluster-randomized trials in Southern Africa. SETTING Eight districts in Zimbabwe and Lesotho. METHODS Individual-level participant data from two cluster-randomized trials that included stable adults receiving ART at 60 facilities were pooled. Both trials had three arms: ART collected three-monthly at healthcare facilities (3MF, control); ART provided three-monthly in community ART groups (CAGs) (3MC); and ART provided six-monthly in either CAGs or on an individual provider-patient basis (6MC). Participant retention, viral suppression (VS) and incidence of unscheduled facility visits were compared. RESULTS 10,136 participants were included, 3817 (37.7%), 2893 (28.5%) and 3426 (33.8%) in arms 3MF, 3MC and 6MC, respectively. After 12 months, retention was non-inferior for 3MC (95.7%) vs. 3MF (95.0%) (adjusted risk difference [aRD]=0.3 [95% CI: -0.8 to 1.4]); and 6MC (95.1%) vs. 3MF (aRD= -0.2 [95% CI:-1.4 to 1.0]). Retention was greater amongst intervention arm participants in CAGs versus 6MC participants not in CAGs, aRD= 1.5% (95% CI: 0.2% to 2.9%). VS was excellent (98%) and unscheduled facility visits were not increased in the intervention arms. CONCLUSIONS Three and six-monthly out-of-facility MMD was non-inferior versus facility-based care for stable ART patients. Out-of-facility six-monthly MMD should incorporate small group peer support whenever possible.","output":"Out-of-Facility Multimonth Dispensing of Antiretroviral Treatment: A Pooled Analysis using Individual Patient Data from Cluster-Randomized Trials in Southern Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest global economic and health challenge of the century. Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.","output":"COVID-19 Mobile Positioning Data Contact Tracing and Patient Privacy Regulations: Exploratory Search of Global Response Strategies and the Use of Digital Tools in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meloxicam, a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, has been used in many exotic animals at doses extrapolated from domestic animal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Increasing evidence suggests that significant species differences exist in meloxicam metabolism. Because of this, dose extrapolation from domestic animals may not be appropriate for exotic species. The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in a population of male Malayan flying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, following a single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Using a sparse sampling method based on a pilot study, two blood samples from each of 10 bats were collected over an 8-hr time period. Analysis of meloxicam in plasma samples was conducted using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peak plasma concentration of 598  157.5 ng/ml occurred at 1.0 hr post dosing. The terminal half-life was 1.1  0.1 hr, which indicates that meloxicam is rapidly metabolized in this species. No adverse clinical effects were noted during the study period. A single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg appears safe for use in male Malayan flying foxes, but due to rapid elimination, frequent dosing may be required to maintain plasma concentrations within a therapeutic range. Multidose studies are needed to determine if plasma accumulation of meloxicam occurs.","output":"PHARMACOKINETICS OF MELOXICAM FOLLOWING A SINGLE ORAL DOSE IN MALAYAN FLYING FOXES ( PTEROPUS VAMPYRUS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older people living in care homes deserve access to specialist palliative care in their last months of life, and this has never been more important than during a global pandemic Palliative Care Needs Rounds facilitated by nurse practitioners are cost-effective, reduce avoidable hospital transfers, improve quality of death and dying, and increase the capacity of staff to recognize and plan for care for dying residents in care homes Conducting Palliative Care Needs Rounds via telehealth increases access to specialist palliative care while reducing the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 transmission","output":"Telehealth Palliative Care Needs Rounds During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) has recently proposed a consensus on the criteria to diagnose malnutrition. The validity of the new criteria to detect malnutrition is still being explored. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the validity of the GLIM criteria for malnutrition in hospitalized patients with gastric cancer (GC) using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) as a comparator. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 217 GC inpatients. Nutrition assessment was performed during their hospitalization with both the GLIM criteria and the PG-SGA. Consistency of the assessment results and their correlation with the quality of life in patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A moderate concordance (K = 0.483, P < 0.001) was founded between the two methods for malnutrition diagnosis. Spearman correlation analysis confirmed the significant association (P < 0.05) between most aspects of the quality of life and nutrition status regarding either the GLIM criteria or the PG-SGA. In multivariate linear regression, adjusted for confounding variables, the quality of life was significantly associated with nutrition status by the GLIM criteria (B = 5.63, 95% CI: 0.09-11.16, P = 0.046), and by the PG-SGA (B = 13.53, 95% CI: 7.78-19.27, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a new understanding of the validity of the GLIM criteria in hospitalized GC patients.

Evidence indicates that professional students in health, social care, and teacher education programs receive inadequate training in recognizing and responding to child maltreatment. The aims are to 1) assess the extent to which these students found that their uniprofessional education and a large-scale interprofessional learning (IPL) course had taught them about children in general, childrens rights, and vulnerable/at-risk children; and 2) explore differences in student responses according to age and educational background. METHODS: A cross-sectional study. Students (n=2811) completed questionnaires prior to or after IPL courses held in 2019 and 2020 (hybrid case-based, small-group, on-campus courses targeting children, young people, and their families as end users). FINDINGS: The majority (>90%) agreed that it was important to learn about child-related topics. Only 4.3% disagreed that it was important to learn about vulnerable/at-risk children. Health and social care students enhanced their insight into all the child-related topics (p<0.001) after the IPL course. Teacher education and child welfare students reported decreased insight into children in general (p<0.001 in 2019 and p=0.008 in 2020) but increased insight into vulnerable/at-risk children in 2020 (p=0.001). According to stratified analyses, there was a significantly increased insight into all child-related topics among physiotherapy and Mensendieck physiotherapy students (p<0.001), decreased insight into children in general among teacher education students (p<0.02), and increased insight into vulnerable/at-risk children among teacher education students (p  0.001) in both 2019 and 2020. Age was of minor importance. The response rates ranged from 16.0% to 36.0%. CONCLUSION: After the IPL course, the health and social care students significantly enhanced their insight into child-related topics, whereas the students in teacher education and child welfare gained increased insight into vulnerable/at-risk children.","output":"A Gap Between Childrens Rights and Curricular Content in Health, Social Care, and Teacher Education Programs: An Exploratory Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of methods based on the deep learning have been applied to medical image segmentation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Due to the importance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for state-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting chest x-rays before obtaining mask annotations about this sort of dataset. The dataset for exploring best pre-trained model is from Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the Chest X-ray. However, most of variant U-Net mainly focus on extraction of contextual information and dense skip connection. There is still a large space for improving extraction of spatial feature. In this paper, we propose a dual encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected recurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating context feature extraction. In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation of features, the inception blocks with dilation have been used. The inception blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information by various receptive fields. Meanwhile, the features fusion of two path by summation preserve the context and the spatial information for decoding part. This multi-learning-scale model are benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from two different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net achieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net, modified R2U-Net and modified attention R2U-Net. This model is proved the feasibility for mixed dataset.

The social distancing requirement, with the aim of reducing contact risk in public transit, could exacerbate traffic congestion and emissions. We propose a simulation tool to evaluate the trade-offs between traffic congestion, emissions, and policies impacting travel behavior to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including social distancing and working from home. Open-source agent-based simulation models are used to evaluate the transportation system usage for the case study of New York City. A Post Processing Software for Air Quality (PPS-AQ) estimation is used to evaluate the air quality impacts. Finally, system-wide contact exposure on the subway is estimated from the traffic simulation output. The social distancing requirement in public transit is found to be effective in reducing contact exposure, but it has negative congestion and emission impacts on Manhattan and neighborhoods at transit and commercial hubs. While telework can reduce congestion and emissions citywide, in Manhattan the negative impacts are higher due to behavioral inertia and social distancing. The findings suggest that contact exposure to COVID-19 on subways is relatively low, especially if social distancing practices are followed. The proposed integrated traffic simulation models and air quality estimation model can help policymakers evaluate the impact of policies on traffic congestion and emissions as well as identifying hot spots, both temporally and spatially.","output":"Mobility in post-pandemic economic reopening under social distancing guidelines: Congestion, emissions, and contact exposure in public transit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of a tool diverting low urgency patients eligible for primary care from an emergency department (ED) to the adjacent general practitioner cooperative (GPC). Methods: Unblinded, randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters (three intervention clusters for each control). The intervention was nurse-led triage using a new tool assigning patients to either ED or GPC. During intervention weekends, patients were encouraged to follow this assignment while it was not communicated to the patients during control weekends (they remained at the ED). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients assigned to and handled by the GPC during intervention weekends. The trial was randomised for the secondary outcome: the proportion of patients assigned to the GPC during intervention and control weekends. Additional outcomes were association of these outcomes with possible confounders (study tool parameters, nurse, and patient characteristics), proportion of patients referred back to the ED by the GPC, hospitalisations, and performance of the study tool to detect primary care eligible patients (with the opinion of the treating physician as the gold standard). Results: In the intervention group, 838/6374 patients (13.3%, 95% CI 12.5 to 14.2) were assigned to the GPC (secondary outcome), in the control group 431/1744 (24.7%, 95% CI 22.7 to 26.8). In the intervention group, 599/6374 patients (9.5%, 95% CI 8.8 to 10.3) experienced the primary outcome which was influenced by the chosen MTS presentational flowchart, patient's age, and the nurse. 24/599 patients (4.0%, 95% CI 2.7 to 5.9) patients were referred back to the ED of which three were hospitalised. Positive and negative predictive values of the studied tool during intervention weekends were 0.96 (95%CI 0.94 to 0.97) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.62). Out of the patients assigned to the GPC, 2.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 3.4) were hospitalised. Conclusions: ED nurses using a new tool safely diverted 9.5% of the included patients to primary care.
