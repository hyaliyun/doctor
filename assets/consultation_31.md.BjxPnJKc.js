Moreover, hypocalcemia (a reduced level of serum ionized calcium) has been shown to be strongly positively associated with Covid-19 severity. Both effectiveness of CCBs as antiviral therapy, and positive associations of hypocalcemia with mortality, have been demonstrated for many other viruses as well. We evaluate these findings in the contexts of virus-host evolutionary conflicts over calcium metabolism, and hypocalcemia as either pathology, viral manipulation, or host defence against pathogens. Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that hypocalcemia represents a host defence. Indeed, hypocalcemia may exert antiviral effects in a similar manner as do CCBs, through interference with calcium metabolism in virus-infected cells. Prospective clinical studies that address the efficacy of CCBs and hypocalcemia should provide novel insights into the pathogenicity and treatment of Covid-19 and other viruses.","output":"Conflicts over calcium and the treatment of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: There is a need to hone reproductive health (RH) services for women who sell sex (WSS).

Exonuclease activity enables the RdRp complex to remove wrongly incorporated bases via proofreading, a process not utilized by other RNA viruses. However, it is unclear why the RdRp complex needs proofreading and what the associated trade-offs are. Here we investigate the interplay among the accuracy, speed, and energetic cost of proofreading in the RdRp complex using a kinetic model and bioinformatics analysis. We find that proofreading nearly optimizes the rate of functional virus production. However, we find that further optimization would lead to a significant increase in the proofreading cost. Unexpected importance of the cost minimization is further supported by other global analyses. We speculate that cost optimization could help avoid cell defense responses. Thus, proofreading is essential for the production of functional viruses, but its rate is limited by energy costs.","output":"Theoretical Analysis Reveals the Cost and Benefit of Proofreading in Coronavirus Genome Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus emergency obliged Italy's government to stop production and trade activities to limit the =risk of contagion.

Recent studies have demonstrated that a minimum of 31% of adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and 18% of adults with leukemia who are hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness have a community respiratory virus infection. The temporal occurrence of these infections in immunocompromised patients tends to mirror their occurrence in the community. The clinical illnesses range from self-limited upper respiratory illnesses to fatal pneumonias, depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression. The pneumonias may be viral, bacterial/fungal, or mixed. The highest frequency of progression to fatal viral pneumonia has been reported for RSV infections in recently transplanted BMT recipients and myelosuppressed patients with leukemia. Studies have suggested that early therapy for RSV pneumonia with a combination of aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies will be a challenge, given the diversity of viruses, the wide spectrum of immunocompromised patients with varying vulnerability to serious community respiratory virus disease, and the frequent presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. A combination of antiviral drugs and immunotherapy may need to be considered for their potential additive effect as well as to prevent the emergence of resistant virus, as occurs during monotherapy for influenza with amantadine or rimantadine. The optimal therapies need to be defined in controlled trials; however, it appears that a favorable response will hinge on the initiation of therapy at an early stage of the respiratory illness.","output":"Community Respiratory Virus Infections in Immunocompromised Patients with Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare hypoxemia severity of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that arrive at an emergency department as classified by three oxygenation indexes. Design: Retrospective analysis of pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis obtained at arrival. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital in Mexico City converted early in the pandemic to a COVID-19 center. Patients and measurements: A total of 2,960 patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the emergency department from April 2020 until March 2021. Pulse oximeter saturation and arterial blood gas analysis was obtained in all of them. Pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) to inspired oxygen fraction ratio (FiO2), oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SatO2) to FiO2 ratio, and oxygen pressure in arterial blood to FiO2 ratio were calculated for every patient. Interventions: None. Main Results: A strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.6, p < 0.001), and SatO2/FiO2 & SpO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001), while a very strong correlation was seen between PaO2/FiO2 & SatO2/FiO2 (rho = 0.88, p < 0.001). When classifying severity by quantiles, considerable cross-over was observed when comparing oxygenation indexes, as only 785 (26.5%) patients were in the same quintile across the three indexes.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one major cancer related to the liver and the most difficult to treat malignancies worldwide. The underlying mechanism of nicotine in the stimulation of HCC tumorigenesis is still not studied well. METHODS: Classically, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and induces many downstream cancer-associated signaling pathways. Big data analysis is used to explore the importance of a7nAChR-Jak2 axis in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to determine gene associated with a7nAChR-Jak2 axis of HCC patients. Biological importance of a7nAChR-Jak2 axis was investigated in vitro (Hun7 and HepG2 cell lines), and athymic nude mouse models bearing HepG2-HCC cells xenografts were established in vivo. RESULT: We found that nicotine exposure stimulated the HCC tumorigenicity by inducing the expression of one of the key nAChRs subunit that is 7nAChR as well as the expression of Janus kinase (JAK)-2. In both the in vitro and in vivo studies, the reduced overexpression of 7nAChR and increased sensitization of HCC towards treatment is observed with dehydrocrenatidine (DHCT), a novel and potent JAK family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, DHCT treatment results in the reduction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process which leads to a significant reduction of clonogenicity, migratory, and invasive ability of HCC cells. Moreover, DHCT treatment also inhibits the cancer stem cell phenotype by inhibiting the tumor-sphere formation and reducing the number of ALDH1+ cells population in nicotine-stimulated HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the presented results indicate the positive effect of inhibition of nicotine induced overexpression of 7nAChR and JAK2, unique to HCC. Thus, these findings suggest the nicotine effect on HCC progression via 7nAChR-mediated JAK2 signaling pathways, and DHCT treatment enhances the therapeutic potential of HCC patients via overcoming/reversing the effect of nicotine in HCC patients.","output":"The Natural Compound Dehydrocrenatidine Attenuates Nicotine-Induced Stemness and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Regulating a7nAChR-Jak2 Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the pattern of hospital admissions for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is changing, and increased mortality and morbidity is being noted in these patients Cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 are complex and include STEMI, myocarditis, myocardial injury, and cardiomyopathy The objective of our study was to compare the data of patients with STEMI presenting in COVID-19 versus the non-COVID-19 era Methods We analyzed the clinical and angiographic characteristics of STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at our center The primary outcome variables were admission rate for STEMI, mean total ischemic time (TIT), coronary artery disease burden, mean ejection fraction, and in-hospital mortality for three defined groups Group A consisted of patients who underwent primary PCI from March through April 2020 Group B included patients who underwent primary PCI from January to February 2020 Group C consisted of patients who underwent primary PCI from March to April 2019 We then compared the data among the three groups and calculated any significant p-value (p&lt; 001) Results In Group A, 1139 patients were admitted for primary PCI The mean admission rate was 18 6 +/- 4 36 admissions per day There were 1535 patients in Group B and an admission rate of 26 01 +/- 4 90 (p&lt; 001 compared to Group A) In Group C, there were 1537 patients and an admission rate of 24 8 +/- 4 55 (p&lt; 001, compared to Group A) The mean TIT was 429 25 +/- 272 16 minutes for Group A, 359 78 +/- 148 04 minutes for Group B, and 346 75 +/- 207 31 minutes for Group C (p&lt; 001) A higher mortality rate was noted in Group A (COVID-19 era) versus Group C (non-COVID-19 era;p&lt; 001) Conclusions A lower admission rate, higher TIT, and higher mortality rates were noted in patients with acute STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID era During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians should bear in mind that patients with STEMI have increased mortality and morbidity Where possible, efforts should be made for timely management of these critical patients to decrease mortality","output":"Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: What is the Clinically Significant Difference?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the rapid urbanization, citizenization of migrants is becoming the development tendency in China.

Infection of HeLa cells with the resulting recombinant adenoviruses AdMHVS, AdMHVN and AdMHVM revealed the correct expression of the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, respectively. Intraperitoneal inoculation of BALB/c mice with the recombinant viruses elicited serum antibodies which specifically recognized the respective MHV proteins in an immunoprecipitation assay. Only antibodies to the S protein neutralized MHV-A59 in vitro but titres were low. When analysed by ELISA or by immunofluorescence only the antibody response to the N protein was significant; weak responses or no detectable response at all were found for S and M, respectively. Upon intracerebral challenge with a lethal dose of MHV-A59 we found that a significant fraction of animals vaccinated with adenovirus vectors expressing either the S protein or N protein were protected. This protective effect was significantly stronger when the animals were given a booster immunization with the same vector prior to challenge. No protection was induced by AdMHVM. Interestingly, enhanced protection resulted when AdMHVS and AdMHVN were applied in combination as compared to survival after single immunizations.

The One Health approach is a pathway to synergistically addressing outcomes in term of health and sustainability, but gender issues at the One Health and biodiversity nexus are largely ignored. By examining the roles and responsibilities of Indigenous and Local People, and especially women, in conserving natural resources, and the social costs of living at the Human-Animal-Environment interface under current conservation strategies, we show that women bear a disproportionate health, poverty and climate burden, despite having pivotal roles in conserving biodiversity. To mitigate risks of emerging infectious diseases, food insecurity and climate change impacts, a gender perspective has previously been proposed, but implementation lags behind. Endemic zoonotic diseases, human-wildlife conflict and environmental pollution lack gender-sensitive frameworks. We demonstrate that women can be powerful agents for change at all levels of society, from communities to businesses, and policy-making institutions, but gender inequalities still persist.

Single sport specialization has become increasingly common with a concurrent increase in injury and burnout. Paralleling trends seen in other aspects of health care, disparities in regard to participation in youth sports, and subsequent injury treatment exist as well. Recognition of these disparities amongst coaches, parents, and athletes involved in youth sports are essential to promote the short- and long-term health of pediatric and adolescent athletes. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple barriers exist for youth in regard to sports participation. Youth who come from families without extensive financial means are increasingly finding it difficult to play organized sports, with this trend holding when broken down by insurance status (public versus private). This problem is further exacerbated by the lack of community-based programming in locations where organized (albeit expensive) options do not exist. The lack of athletic trainers increases the divide, as well as the care that injured athletes receive (particularly in public schools within communities of color) is not equivalent to schools with extensive financial resources. Thus, ability to quickly return to play after injury and/or access the health care system is limited. This is further exemplified by inferior outcomes in regard to care for anterior cruciate ligament, meniscus, shoulder instability, and concussions in this population. SUMMARY: Youth sports participation is laden with multiple disparities. This is unfortunately reflective of historical barriers to opportunities/advancements in multiple other areas of society. These disparities place certain groups of children at an uphill battle not only for participation when healthy, but also returning to participation when injured. Larger structural changes in youth sports are necessary to promote life-long, healthy physical activities for individuals most at risk.","output":"Disparities in Youth Sports and Barriers to Participation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper assesses the Granger causality between government spending and gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States at multiple horizons. This paper also analyses the role the real exchange rate plays in the causality measure during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period. Many researchers using theoretical models built in a closed economy suggest that the elasticity between government spending and GDP is very large, when the nominal interest rate is binding. Other researchers, also using theoretical models generally built in an open economy, suggest that the elasticity in the ZLB period is not large. The same conflicting results are reported in the empirical literature mostly using vector auto regressives (VARs), with different restrictions. In this paper, we use a different approach to measure the link between the two variables. The new approach has the advantage of not relying on any restrictions, as is the case with VARs when dealing with causalities. Moreover, our approach is not related to the way the model is built, as is the case with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) types of models. In this paper, we use a Granger causality measure to compare the causality for normal periods with the causality for the ZLB period. We emphasize the role played by the real exchange rate. Our empirical results provide evidence that the causality measures between government spending and GDP are larger and persistent in the ZLB period, but only if the exchange rate is not taken into account. When the exchange rate is taken into account, our measure of causality becomes very small and non-persistent.","output":"Government Spending, GDP and Exchange Rate in Zero Lower Bound: Measuring Causality at Multiple Horizons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: .

Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors-pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"An ancient viral epidemic involving host coronavirus interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Harm reduction services to people who use drugs (PWUD) in Russia are insufficient in terms of quantity, government endorsement, and accessibility. The situation has recently deteriorated even further because of social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several organizations have started to provide some harm reduction services via online platforms by web outreach. However, little is known on how online outreach services are organized and implemented. Drawing on the example of St. Petersburg-based NGO \\"Humanitarian Action,\\" we explored web outreach work in Telegram instant messenger. METHODS: Our data were comprised of 4 semi-structured interviews with the NGO staff and 301 cases of web outreach work with PWUD. We used thematic analysis to study the process of web outreach, harm reduction service provision, and needs of PWUD. RESULTS: Three stages of the process of web outreach work were identified: clients initiating communication, NGO workers addressing clients' needs, and NGO workers receiving clients' feedback. Communication proceeded in group chat or direct messages. Challenges in addressing clients' needs happened when clients turned for help after hours, sent recorded voice messages, sent unclear messages, and/or were unwilling to transition to telephone communication. All web outreach workers reported receiving only positive feedback on their work. The needs of PWUD were categorized into two major themes, depending on whether they can be addressed fully or partially online. In cases of online only provision of services, web outreach workers helped PWUD treat minor injection drug use complications, obtain verified harm reduction information and receive general psychological support. In instances of partial online services provision, PWUD were assisted in getting treatment of severe injection drug use complications, overdoses, and in accessing offline medical, psychological, social, legal and harm reduction services. CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated that web outreach work is a convenient tool for delivering some harm reduction services to PWUD either partially or completely online and for recruiting new clients (including hard-to-reach PWUD that avoid attending brick-and-mortar facilities). Harm reduction organizations should consider incorporating online harm reduction services into their activities. However, further research is needed to explore relative advantages and disadvantages of online harm reduction services.","output":"Harm reduction via online platforms for people who use drugs in Russia: a qualitative analysis of web outreach work"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Violence against health workers has been considered a common issue throughout the world.

Methods: PubMed, Ebsco, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data were searched from their inception to December 2020. Intervention studies with a control group that examined the effects of HIIT interventions on sleep were included in this meta-analysis. The risk of bias was assessed using the tool provided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Effect sizes (ESs), calculated as weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD), were used to examine the effects of objective outcomes and subjective outcomes separately. Results: A large increase in sleep quality (SQ) reflected by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global scores [WMD = ?0.90, 95%CI (?1.72, ?0.07), p = 0.03, n = 8] and a small-to-medium favorable effect on sleep efficiency (SE) [SMD = 0.43, 95%CI (0.20, 0.65), p = 0.0002, n = 10] were found after HIIT intervention. In addition, sub-analyses results suggest that ESs were moderated by the type, duration and frequency, as well as the length of the HIIT intervention.

They are often used interchangeably, but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be. We review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers. RECENT FINDINGS: In many clinical scenarios, the data supports similar efficacy between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, while in a minority of others, there are murky signals from previous trials that suggest ACE inhibitors may be better. However, when reviewing the literature in its entirety, and taking into account recently published pooled analysis and head to head trials, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar efficacy. This is in contrast to data on adverse effects, which consistently favors the use of ARBs. From the available data, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have equal efficacy yet unequal adverse effects. It is in this context that we take the provocative stance that ACE inhibitors should not be used to treat hypertension.","output":"Should Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ever Be Used for the Management of Hypertension?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented disruptions to financial and economic markets around the globe, leading to one of the fastest U.S. stock market declines in history.

Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS Staff working in critical care. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients.

The CGR representation is a mapping technique that assigns each sequence base into the respective position in the two-dimension plane to portray the DNA sequence. Importantly, CGR provides one to one mapping to nucleotides as well as sequence. A coordinate of the CGR plane can tell the corresponding base and its location in the original genome. Therefore, the whole nucleotide sequence (until the current nucleotide) can be restored from the one point of the CGR. In this study, CGR coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced as a new way to represent the genome and to classify intra-coronavirus sequences. A hierarchy clustering study is done to validate the approach and found to be more than 90% accurate while comparing the result with the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding genomes.

Although FDG-PET is not indicated for the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, focally increased glucose metabolism within breast tissue represents a high likelihood for a neoplastic process and requires further evaluation. Focally increased glucose metabolism is not unique to breast cancer. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, metastases from solid tumors as well as inflammatory changes also may demonstrate increased glucose metabolism either within the breast or at other sites throughout the body. Importantly, benign breast disease may also exhibit increased glucose metabolism, limiting the specificity of FDG-PET. Breast cancer has a wide range of metabolic activity attributed to tumor heterogeneity and breast cancer subtype. Intracellular signaling pathways regulating tumor glucose utilization contribute to these pitfalls of PET/CT in breast cancer. The evaluation of axillary lymph nodes by FDG-PET is less accurate than sentinel lymph node procedure, however is very accurate in identifying level II and III axillary lymph node metastases or retropectoral metastases. It is important to note that non-malignant inflammation in lymph nodes are often detected by modern PET/CT technology. Therefore, particular consideration should be given to recent vaccinations, particularly to COVID-19, which can commonly result in increased metabolic activity of axillary nodes. Whole body FDG-PET for staging of breast cancer requires specific attention to physiologic variants of FDG distribution and a careful comparison with co-registered anatomical imaging.

METHODS From 1994 to 2018, 552 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, unilateral in 531 and bilateral in 21 patients (9 females and 12 males). All patients who underwent LBA were approached via a transperitoneal anterior route and form our study population. Indications included: Cushing's disease (n = 11), pheochromocytoma (n = 6), Conn's disease (n = 3) and adrenal cysts (n = 1). RESULTS Mean operative time was 195  86.2 min (range 55-360 min). Conversion was necessary in one case for bleeding. Three patients underwent concurrent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and ductal stone extraction in one. Three postoperative complications occurred in one patient each: subhepatic fluid collection, intestinal ileus and pleural effusion. Mean hospital stay was 6.1  4.7 days (range 2-18 days). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, transperitoneal anterior LBA was feasible and safe. Based on our results, we believe that this approach leads to prompt recognition of anatomical landmarks with early division of the main adrenal vein prior to any gland manipulation, with a low risk of bleeding and without the need to change patient position. Unlike the lateral approach, there is no need to mobilize the spleno-pancreatic complex on the left or the liver on the right.

Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms underpinning CKD is crucial to decelerate its progression towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Renal tubular cells are populated with a high number of mitochondria, which produce cellular energy and modulate several important cellular processes, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium homeostasis, proliferation, and apoptosis. Over the past few years, increasing evidence has implicated renal mitochondrial damage in the pathogenesis of common etiologies of CKD, such as diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome (MetS), chronic renal ischemia, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). However, most compelling evidence is based on preclinical studies because renal biopsies are not routinely performed in many patients with CKD. Previous studies have shown that urinary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers may serve as non-invasive biomarkers of renal mitochondrial dysfunction. Emerging data also suggest that CKD is associated with altered expression of mitochondria-related microRNAs (mitomiRs), which localize in mitochondria and regulate the expression of mtDNA and nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes.

Our study investigated fear of malpractice among Chinese medical workers, assessed its association with burnout, and explored the mediating role of legal consciousness between these factors. DESIGN: A quantitative, cross-sectional study. SETTING: All respondents were investigated using a self-report questionnaire. Demographic characteristics and measurements including a fear of malpractice scale, and a burnout and legal consciousness scale were employed. The effect of fear of malpractice on burnout was examined by carrying out a binary regression analysis. A mediation model was used to test the mediating role of legal consciousness. PARTICIPANTS: The study sample included 1031 doctors and nurses (297 male and 734 female; age = 36.3  8.98). RESULTS: The average score of fear of malpractice was 20.97  5.34. Respondents with higher levels of fear of malpractice were more prone to burnout ([OR] = 2.865; 95% CI 1.942C4.226). Legal consciousness partially and negatively mediated the effect of fear of malpractice on burnout. CONCLUSION: High levels of fear of malpractice were found among Chinese medical workers, and this fear had a significant effect on burnout. Legal consciousness may be a resource that can alleviate burnout.","output":"The association between fear of malpractice and burnout among Chinese medical workers: The mediating role of legal consciousness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with the ability to escape existing humoral protection conferred by previous infection and/or immunization necessitates the discovery of broadly-reactive neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Utilizing mRNA display, we identify a set of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins and characterize the structures of nAbs that recognize epitopes in the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein. These structural studies reveal distinct binding modes for several antibodies, including targeting of rare cryptic epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S that interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate infection, as well as the S1 subdomain 1. Further, we engineer a potent ACE2-blocking nAb to sustain binding to S RBD with the E484K and L452R substitutions found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We demonstrate that mRNA display is a promising approach for the rapid identification of nAbs that can be used in combination to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Rapid Identification of Neutralizing Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Variants by mRNA Display"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, data analysis has become a problem as the amount of data is constantly increasing.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sidedness, recurrence, and survival among patients with localized colon cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of colon cancer (2006-2013) were identified from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Risk for recurrence, overall survival, and survival after recurrence (SAR) were compared between left- and right-sided tumors using the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS We evaluated 673 patients (347 right-sided). There was no difference in overall recurrence rates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.55; P = .75) or overall survival (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75-1.97; P = .42) between right- and left-sided primary tumors. However, right-sided tumors were more likely to develop multi-focal and poor prognostic site recurrence (P = .04). Among the 71 patients who developed recurrence, those with right-sided tumors had significantly lower SAR (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.42-10.62; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection, tumor sidedness was not associated with recurrence risk. However, among patients who developed recurrence, right-sidedness was associated with unique recurrence patterns and inferior SAR.

There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections. Influenza virus, despite causing approximately one billion annual infections globally, has only a few cases of confirmed or suspected intrauterine fetal infections reported. RSV is in an unusual cause of illness among pregnant women, and with the exception of one premature infant with congenital pneumonia, no other cases of maternal-fetal infection are described. Parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus can produce symptomatic maternal infections but do not cause intrauterine fetal infection. In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered an inflammatory response as evidenced by increased IL-6 expression.

One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats.

In December 2019 a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was iden-tified in China, causing a pandemic with devastating effects. For this reason, the State of Emergency (SE) was declared in Portugal for the first time in this pandemic, between 18 March and 2 May 2020, and all non-urgent activity was suspended in our hospital, including the administration of subcutaneous immunotherapy with aeroallergens (SCITA). Objective: Cha-racterize the dose adjustments according to the delay in SCITA administration, verify the safety of the dose administered when resuming SCITA and evaluate the worsening of symptoms of the allergic disease, in patients under SCITA program that inter-rupted it during the SE. Material and methods: An analysis of the SCITA clinical records of the 195 patients who interrupt-ed the maintenance dose during EE was performed. According to the symptoms and the delay interval, the dose was reduced or a new initiation protocol was performed, according to our Allergen Immunotherapy Functional Unit protocol, adapted from international guidelines for this specific time. Results: 7.7% of patients had worsening of allergic symptoms during the interruption period and 6.2% resorted to rescue therapy. 96.4% decreased the dose in SCITA resumption, with a decrease that was mostly greater than predicted, according to our protocol. Immediate local reactions were recorded in 9.2%, with no ana-phylactic reactions. After recovery, 9.7% worsened symptoms and 5.1% resorted to rescue therapy. Conclusions: The pandemic made it very difficult to monitor patients chronic pathologies, including allergic diseases. The majority of patients did not report worsening of symptoms and few had adverse reactions in the resumption of SCITA, demonstrating the safety of the dose adjustment protocol. ? 2021 Sociedade Portuguesa de Alergologia e Imunologia Clnica.

Quantification accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated using serially diluted samples from 60 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Assay performance was evaluated using serum samples from the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and 500 SARS-CoV-2-negative serum samples collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. The system showed high quantification accuracy (range, 10(2)), high reproducibility (within 5%), and no cross-reaction between SARS1- and MERS-S proteins. Detection accuracy was 98.3% and 93.3% for IgG and IgM against spike proteins and 100% and 71.7% for IgG and IgM against nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. Mean antibody levels were > 10 times that in negative samples upon admission and > 100 times that at convalescent periods. Clinical severity upon admission was not correlated with IgG or IgM levels.

The short-term cardiac outcome in survivors of COVID-19 is not known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the heart of patients who survived COVID-19 and to compare the cardiac outcome between patients who recovered from mild-to-moderate or severe illness. METHODS: With use of ECG and echocardiography, we examined the heart of 105 patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 and were consecutively recruited after hospital discharge while attending follow-up visits. Survivors of COVID-19 were compared with 105 matched controls. We also compared the cardiac outcome and lung ultrasound scan between COVID-19 patients who had mild-to-moderate or severe illness. RESULTS: Cardiac data were collected a median of 41 days from the first detection of COVID-19. Symptoms were present in a low percentage of patients. In comparison with matched controls, no considerable structural or functional differences were observed in the heart of survivors of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound scan detected significantly greater residual pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients who had recovered from severe than mild-to-moderate illness. No significant differences were detected in ECG tracings nor were found in the left and right ventricular function of patients who had recovered from mild-to-moderate or severe illness. CONCLUSIONS: In a short-term follow-up, no abnormalities were identified in the heart of survivors of COVID-19, nor cardiac differences were detected between patients who had different severity of illness.

Two of the mechanisms of balancing selection currently thought to explain the long-term persistence of polymorphisms are the evolution of alternative phenotypic optima through correlational selection on suites of traits including color and heterosis. Both of these mechanisms can generate differences in offspring viability and fitness arising from different morph combinations. Here, we examined the effect of parental morph combination on fertilization success, embryonic viability, newborn quality, antipredator, and foraging behavior, as well as inter-annual survival by conducting controlled matings in a polymorphic lacertid Podarcis muralis, where color morphs are frequently assumed to reflect alternative phenotypic optima (e.g., alternative reproductive strategies). Juveniles were kept in outdoor tubs for a year in order to study inter-annual growth, survival, and morph inheritance. In agreement with a previous genome-wide association analysis, morph frequencies in the year-old juveniles matched the frequencies expected if orange and yellow expressions depended on recessive homozygosity at 2 separate loci. Our findings also agree with previous literature reporting higher reproductive output of heavy females and the higher overall viability of heavy newborn lizards, but we found no evidence for the existence of alternative breeding investment strategies in female morphs, or morph-combination effects on offspring viability and behavior. We conclude that inter-morph breeding remains entirely viable and genetic incompatibilities are of little significance for the maintenance of discrete color morphs in P. muralis from the Pyrenees.","output":"Viability, behavior, and color expression in the offspring of matings between common wall lizard Podarcis muralis color morphs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Threatening or obscene messaging is repeated, unwanted texts, emails, letters or cards experienced by the recipient as threatening or obscene, and causing fear, alarm or distress. It is rarely examined as an aspect of intimate partner violence. We describe the prevalence of exposure to threatening/obscene messaging from a current or ex-partner; characteristics of victims; and associations with other forms of violence and abuse, mental disorder, self-harm, and suicidality. METHODS: Cross-sectional probability-sample survey of the general population in England aged 16 + . Multivariable regression modelling tested associations between receipt of threatening/obscene messaging and current common mental disorder, past-year self-harm and suicidality. RESULTS: Threatening/obscene messages were received from a current/ex-partner by 6.6% (95%CI: 5.9C7.3) of adults who had been in a relationship; 1.7% received these in the past year. Victims were more likely to be female, under 35, single or divorced, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and to have experienced other forms of sexual and partner violence and abuse. Those who received threatening/obscene messages in the past year were more likely to experience common mental disorder (adjusted odds ratio 1.89; 1.01C3.55), self-harm (2.31; 1.00C5.33), and suicidal thoughts (2.00; 1.06C3.78). CONCLUSION: Threatening/obscene messaging commonly occurs in the context of intimate partner violence. While often occurring alongside sexual and physical violence, messaging has an additional association with mental disorder and suicidality. Routine enquiry in service settings concerning safety, including those working with people who have escaped domestic violence, should ask about ongoing contact from previous as well as current partners. This should include asking about messaging, as well as other forms of potentially technology-enabled abuse which may become increasingly common.

The current treatments for HCC suffer from drug resistance and poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Phytochemicals have been proposed to treat a range of cancers. Among them, -lipoic acid (-LA), a naturally synthesized antioxidant found in various dietary animal and plant sources, prevents oxidant-mediated cell death in normal cells while inducing apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Previously, we demonstrated that the treatment of hepatoma cells with -LA induced apoptosis, which was preceded by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the p53 protein, a known inducer of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Several studies have shown that ROS-induced apoptosis is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) activation. Herein, we investigated if -LA-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cell lines was ER stress- and UPR-mediated by gene expression profiling analyses. UPR and ER stress pathways were the most up-regulated after treatment with -LA. This finding, which has been confirmed by expression analyses of ER- and UPR-associated proteins, provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-tumoral action of -LA on hepatoma cells.","output":"-Lipoic acid induces Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in hepatoma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative of the COVID-19 disease, which has spread pandemically around the globe within a few months.

In this study, we turn to the ribosome and show computationally that holes can also efficiently migrate within the whole ribosomal small subunit (SSU). The potential sites of charge localization in SSU are revealed, and it is shown that most of them are located in the functionally important areas of the ribosomeintersubunit bridges, Fe(4)S(4) cluster, and the pivot linking the SSU head to its body. As a result, we suppose that hole localization within the SSU can affect intersubunit rotation (ratcheting) and SSU head swiveling, in agreement with the scenario of electronic coordination of ribosome operation.

As of November 2020, COVID-19 vaccines became available following Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued by the FDA. Recent longitudinal studies published as of March 2021 demonstrated that vaccine hesitancy remains high despite improvements compared to 2020. This study sought to explore the perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge surrounding COVID-19 and identify determinants uniquely associated with vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey was created based on CDC & IDSA recommendations. The survey was distributed from March 2021 until June 2021 randomly to faculty members, healthcare workers, and students (18 years old) across 3 major academic centers (Case Western Reserve University, Spectrum Health, and the American University of Beirut Medical Center [AUBMC]). Data collected included socio-economic characteristics, demographics, knowledge, and attitudes pertaining to COVID-19 and vaccination. A multivariable regression model was utilized to evaluate for independent associations between variables and vaccination willingness/hesitancy as the primary outcome. RESULTS: In total, 7,197 participants completed the survey with an overall response rate of 94%. Females constituted 75.7% of the study population. Overall, 87.8% of the study cohort indicated willingness to get vaccinated. Factors associated independently with vaccination hesitancy included: younger age, lower attained education, lower knowledge score, physician recommendation against vaccination, not receiving the influenza vaccine annually, and other beliefs and attitudes as reported in table 1. Table 1. Independent predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among study respondents [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most survey respondents indicated willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The perception or belief that vaccination is more harmful than COVID-19 disease represented an especially robust barrier against vaccination. Since recommendations made by healthcare providers were strongly associated with either vaccination hesitancy or willingness to get vaccinated, developing educational strategies at this level could enhance vaccine acceptance in an effort to curb the pandemic.

This has been attributed to a milder postoperative inflammatory response by the innate immune system potentially mediated through immune mediators released by the visceral adipose tissue (VAT).

METHODS Male Wistar rats (N = 24) underwent standardized surgical procedures of conventional cecum resection (CCR), conventional sham operation, laparoscopic cecum resection (LCR), or laparoscopic sham operation. Cytokine expression of leptin, resistin, and IL-6 was analyzed in VAT before and after resection by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS Postoperative leptin gene expression was reduced in the CCR and LCR groups, while expression was not significantly affected in both sham groups compared to the preoperative levels. In contrast, IL-6 expression was not affected in the LCR group, but was significantly elevated in the CCR cohort. The IL-6 expression was significantly higher in CCR compared to LCR. Resistin expression levels did not differ between all groups. CONCLUSIONS Our study underlines the role of immunological involvement of VAT in the postoperative phase. Low leptin levels seem to act as a stimulator for energy uptake in order to cope with postoperative stress.

The opportunities for Med I and Med 2 students for bedside teaching have been a particular challenge. During the Cardiology clinical skills unit at Dalhousie University there was a shift in Public Health recommendations necessitating a quick change in teaching strategy during the second wave of the pandemic. With medical students no longer able to enter the hospital for practice histories and physicals on real cardiac patients, an effort was made to provide a similar experience using a virtual platform. METHODS AND RESULTS Bedside teaching for cardiology at Dalhousie (Halifax site) involves three 4-week rotations of roughly 28 students per group. One of these groups was provided with a virtual experience using a hospitalized patient with cardiac disease on week one, followed by in-person clinical skills teaching with a standardized patient without cardiac disease in weeks 2-4. For the virtual experience the history portion was conducted using Zoom, and the physical examination was demonstrated using an iPhone connected to an electronic stethoscope which allowed broadcast of heart sounds to the students over the Zoom platform. The stethoscope used was the Thinklabs OneTM digital. The three in-person sessions were provided in groups of 4 students to one standardized patient along with a cardiologist. At the end of the four-week session the students were asked to evaluate the experience of the virtual history and physical examination with the real patient in a short survey and compare it to the standardized patient experience. Of the 28 students, 16 completed the evaluation survey (57%). All students (100%) selected either Agree or Strongly agree on a 5-point Likert scale when asked if the virtual session provided a valuable learning experience for both history taking and physical examination. The majority of students (87.5%) also felt that the virtual bedside teaching was either equivalent or preferable to the in-person learning experience with the standardized patient. CONCLUSION Virtual clinical skills teaching using a Zoom platform and an electronic stethoscope was both feasible and provided a valuable alternative learning experience for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"VIRTUAL CARDIOLOGY CLINICAL SKILLS TEACHING FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS USING AN ELECTRONIC STETHOSCOPE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: FEASIBILITY AND FEEDBACK."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The official data for the time evolution of active cases of COVID-19 pandemics around the world are available online.

Recently however they have been discovered in Archaea, diverse Bacteria, and Mammals. The biological factors underlying lifes ability to create overlapping genes require more study, and may have important applications in understanding evolution and in biotechnology. A previous study claimed that protein domains from viruses were much better suited to forming overlaps than those from other cellular organisms - in this study we assessed this claim, in order to discover what might underlie taxonomic differences in the creation of gene overlaps. RESULTS: After overlapping arbitrary Pfam domain pairs and evaluating them with Hidden Markov Models we find OLG construction to be much less constrained than expected. For instance, close to 10% of the constructed sequences cannot be distinguished from typical sequences in their protein family. Most are also indistinguishable from natural protein sequences regarding identity and secondary structure. Surprisingly, contrary to a previous study, virus domains were much less suitable for designing OLGs than bacterial or eukaryotic domains were. In general, the amount of amino acid change required to force a domain to overlap is approximately equal to the variation observed within a typical domain family. The resulting high similarity between natural sequences and those altered so as to overlap is mostly due to the combination of high redundancy in the genetic code and the evolutionary exchangeability of many amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic overlapping genes which closely resemble natural gene sequences, as measured by HMM profiles, are remarkably easy to construct, and most arbitrary domain pairs can be altered so as to overlap while retaining high similarity to the original sequences. Future work however will need to assess important factors not considered such as intragenic interactions which affect protein folding. While the analysis here is not sufficient to guarantee functional folding proteins, further analysis of constructed OLGs will improve our understanding of the origin of these remarkable genetic elements across life and opens up exciting possibilities for synthetic biology.

In the current COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a lack of reliable clinical tools to assist clinicians to perform accurate triage. Host response biomarkers have recently shown promise in risk stratification of disease progression; however, the role of these biomarkers in predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Here, we present a protocol outlining a prospective validation study to evaluate the biomarkers performance in predicting clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective validation study assesses patients infected with COVID-19, in whom blood samples are prospectively collected. Recruited patients include a range of infection severity from asymptomatic to critically ill patients, recruited from the community, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and hospitals. Study samples consist of peripheral blood samples collected into RNA-preserving (PAXgene/Tempus) tubes on patient presentation or immediately on study enrolment. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be performed on total RNA extracted from collected blood samples using primers specific to host response gene expression biomarkers that have been previously identified in studies of respiratory viral infections. The RT-PCR data will be analysed to assess the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers in predicting COVID-19-related outcomes, such as viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or bacterial pneumonia. Biomarker performance will be evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol aims to study the host response gene expression biomarkers in severe respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential (COVID-19). It has been approved by the local ethics committee with approval number 2020/ETH00886. The results of this project will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.","output":"Prospective validation study of prognostic biomarkers to predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19: a study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF) is a heat-stable pentapeptide from Entamoeba histolytica.

Microglia/macrophage polarization has been proven to be vital in the pathology of ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, whether MLIF is able to modulate microglia/macrophage polarization remains unclear. We performed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on C57BL/6J male mice and induced cultured BV2 microglia by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), respectively. Immunfluorescence was utilized to detect the M1/2 markers, such as CD206 and CD16/32. qPCR and ELISA were used to detect the signature gene change of M1/2. The MAPK and NF-B pathway associated proteins were measured by Western blot. To identify the protein target of MLIF, a pull-down assay was performed. We found that MLIF promoted microglia transferring from a sick M1 phenotype to a healthy M2 phenotype in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, we proved that eukaryotic elongation factor 1A1 (eEF1A1) was involved in the modulation of microglia/macrophage polarization. Knocking down eEF1A1 by siRNA exhibited the M1 promotion effect and M2 inhibition effect.

This pandemic has not only adversely affected the health systems but has also disrupted the manufacturing and industrial sectors and thus leading to low CO2 emissions. Reduction in the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission has been noticed nearly everywhere in the world due to shutdown of industries and lockdown imposed by governments as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year 2019, around 37 billion tons of CO2 emitted globally that has been reduced by 9% in the same period (January to July) for the year 2020 as consequence of COVID-19 pandemic. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) of a country reflects the economic damages caused by per ton increase in the CO2 emissions. Economic and environmental benefits are associated with the reduction of CO2 emissions as a result of COVID-19 and their estimation is the main theme of the study. Coupling reduction in the CO2 emissions to the Social Cost of Carbon gives economic benefit for a country. The research presented investigates the long term economic and environmental benefits associated with the reduction in the CO2 emissions for various regions of the world. The economic benefit due to the reduction in the of the CO2 emissions as consequence of the COVID-19 to global economy is estimated as 650 billion US Dollars for the period of 6 months (from January to July). The study mainly focuses on the countries that contribute the high percentage of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The first half of year 2020 (from January 2020 to July 2020) is taken into consideration because lockdown was mainly followed in that period.

We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of echocardiographic parameters in patients with COVID-19 infection and underlying CVD. Methods: One hundred fifty-seven consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) structure and function were assessed using bedside echocardiography. Results: Eighty-nine of the 157 patients (56.7%) had underlying CVD. Compared with patients without CVD, those with CVD had a higher mortality (22.5 vs. 4.4%, p = 0.002) and experienced more clinical events including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injury, or deep vein thrombosis. CVD patients presented with poorer LV diastolic and RV systolic function compared to those without CVD. RV dysfunction (30.3%) was the most frequent, followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (9.0%) and LV systolic dysfunction (5.6%) in CVD patients. CVD patients with high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TNI) elevation or requiring mechanical ventilation therapy demonstrated worsening RV function compared with those with normal hs-TNI or non-intubated patients, whereas LV systolic or diastolic function was similar. Impaired RV function was associated with elevated hs-TNI level. RV function and elevated hs-TNI level were independent predictors of higher mortality in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 infection and underlying CVD displayed impaired LV diastolic and RV function, whereas LV systolic function was normal in most patients.

Mice were bred as the genetically heterogeneous progeny of a cross between CB6F1 mothers and C3D2F1 fathers. Half of the mice were fed ad libitum (AL group), and the other half were subjected to 60% calorie restriction (CR group). Each mouse was tested at about 9 months of age using age-sensitive tests of immune status, and then again at about 12 months of age using age-sensitive tests of muscle function. The data were then analyzed using the method of partial least squares to determine the combinations of test weights that maximize the covariance of the weighted sum of immune measures with the weighted sum of muscle function measures. Both AL and CR mice exhibited a statistically significant relation between the immune status tests and the muscle function tests. Maximal covariance was obtained with a set of weighting coefficients consistent with our working hypothesis: mice with high levels of CD4 memory T cells (which increase with age) also had relatively low levels of muscle strength and endurance. Low strength was associated with low CD8 cells in the AL mice, with high numbers of CD8 memory cells in the CR mice and with low CD3 cells in both diet groups. The partial least squares method generates composite indices of immune status and muscle function that can be evaluated as biomarkers of aging rate in these mice.

The blockage of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to downstream consequences such as increased vascular tone, extensive fibrosis and pronounced immune reactions. Different approaches to tackle the adverse viral effects by compensating the lost ACE2 function have been suggested. Here, we use an unequal-arm lever model to describe a simplified version of the biased regulation exercised by the angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) hormones, which are the substrate and the product of ACE2, respectively. We reason upon the lever dynamics and its disruptions caused by the virus, and propose that a combination of RAS modulators will most efficiently compensate the imbalance due to the excess of angiotensin II and the scarcity of angiotensin-(1-7). Specifically, we focus on the possible benefits of the simultaneous application of two agents, a MAS-receptor agonist and an angiotensin-II-type-2-receptor agonist. We conjecture that this combination has the potential to introduce a beneficial synergistic action that promotes anti-hypoxic, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative effects, thereby improving the clinical management of acute and chronic CoViD-19 pathologies.","output":"Strengthening CoViD-19 therapy via combinations of RAS modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that the odds of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with celiac disease (CeD) is similar to that of the general population. However, how patients with CeD perceive their COVID-19 risk may differ from their actual risk. AIM: To investigate risk perceptions of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and determine the factors that may influence their perception. METHODS: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac conditions, respiratory conditions, and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 10737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD perceived an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 when compared to infections in general due to their CeD (56.1% vs 26.7%, P < 0.0001). Consequently, 34.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations were less likely to perceive an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, P < 0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.99 to 0.99, P < 0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76 to 0.93, P = 0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82 to 0.96, P = 0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk and the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.22 to 1.54, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, high levels of risk perceptions, such as those found in patients with CeD, may increase an individual's pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences. Therefore, it is encouraged that public health officials maintain consistent communication with the public and healthcare providers with the celiac community. Future studies specifically evaluating mental health in CeD could help determine the consequences of increased risk perceptions in this population.","output":"Risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19 in patients with celiac disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, telemedicine and HIV self-testing were adopted by Brazilian Public Health services to minimize disruptions in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access and delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study has been conducted in SLE patients (supplemented and not supplemented patients), matched to healthy controls by age and gender. The 25[OH]D serum level was measured by chemiluminescence assay and CYP27B1-1260 genetic polymorphism was carried out using PCR-RFLP methods. Statistical analysis was made using Shesis and SPSS.20 Software. RESULTS Controls and Vit D not supplemented patients' groups presented the highest percentage of hypovitaminosis D. A significant difference in the mean level of circulating 25[OH]D between Vit D supplemented SLE patients and controls was observed (23.91 ng/ml and 7.18 ng/ml, respectively p = 3.4 105 ). Our results showed a correlation of high 25[OH]D level with complement component 3 levels and prednisolone drug.

In an attempt to control its spread and reduce its health impacts, several countries including those in the African continent imposed restrictive measures that was termed lockdown. The outcomes of this lockdown have been reported to be beneficial to air quality worldwide. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels over six major cities in Nigeria. Maps extracted from satellite (Sentinel-5P) were used to indicate the significant reduction in the level of NO2 in the selected cities in Nigeria during two time-intervals, pre-lockdown (December, 2019) and during lockdown (April, 2020). The results show a significant reduction in NO2 levels during the lockdown period compared with its levels during the pre-lockdown period in 2019. The reduction in NO2 concentration levels during lockdown is likely due to less traffic, social distancing and restrictions on business and human activities. There could be an element of uncertainty in the results due to seasonality, as the comparison is done with a different season. However, the magnitude of change due to lockdown is probably much higher than the seasonal variability. Although COVID-19 has negatively impacted the health and economic status of all regions worldwide, it has benefited some aspects of air quality in most countries including Nigeria.

Redondoviruses were detected in approximately 60% of study participants, including 33% (30/91) of samples collected during episodes of acute respiratory disease and in 50% (29/58) of baseline samples (with no respiratory symptoms). Vientovirus (73%; 24/33) was detected more frequently in samples than brisaviruses (27%; 9/33).

Given the increasing use of genomics in virus discovery and the otherwise sparse knowledge of the biology of newly discovered viruses, we developed machine learning models that identify candidate zoonoses solely using signatures of host range encoded in viral genomes. Within a dataset of 861 viral species with known zoonotic status, our approach outperformed models based on the phylogenetic relatedness of viruses to known human-infecting viruses (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.773), distinguishing high-risk viruses within families that contain a minority of human-infecting species and identifying putatively undetected or so far unrealized zoonoses. Analyses of the underpinnings of model predictions suggested the existence of generalizable features of viral genomes that are independent of virus taxonomic relationships and that may preadapt viruses to infect humans. Our model reduced a second set of 645 animal-associated viruses that were excluded from training to 272 high and 41 very high-risk candidate zoonoses and showed significantly elevated predicted zoonotic risk in viruses from nonhuman primates, but not other mammalian or avian host groups.

However, extant interventions to tackle loneliness have had only modest success, and none have been trialled under conditions of such threat. METHOD: 174 young people with depression and loneliness were randomised to one of two evidence-based treatments: cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or Groups 4 Health (G4H), an intervention designed to increase social group belonging. Depression, loneliness, and well-being outcomes were evaluated at one-year follow-up; COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed partway through follow-up assessments. This provided a quasi-experimental test of the utility of each intervention in the presence (lockdown group) and absence (control group) of a threat to social connectedness. RESULTS: At one-year follow-up, participants in lockdown reported significantly poorer wellbeing than controls who completed follow-up before lockdown, t(152)=2.41, p=.017. Although both CBT and G4H led to symptom improvement, the benefits of G4H were more robust following an unanticipated threat to social connectedness for depression ((2)(16)=31.35, p=.001), loneliness ((2)(8)=21.622, p=.006), and wellbeing ((2)(8)=22.938, p=.003). LIMITATIONS: Because the COVID-19 lockdown was unanticipated, this analysis represents an opportunistic use of available data. As a result, we could not measure the specific impact of restrictions on participants, such as reduced income, degree of isolation, or health-related anxieties. CONCLUSIONS: G4H delivered one year prior to COVID-19 lockdown offered greater protection than CBT against relapse of loneliness and depression symptoms.

The possible use of smallpox as a bioterrorism agent as well as the continuous occurrence of zoonotic pox virus infections document the relevance to deepen the understanding for virus host interactions. Since the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response, it directly depends on the hosts proteome set. In this report the proteome of HEK293 cells infected with Vaccinia Virus strain IHD-W was analyzed by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS in a bottom-up approach. RESULTS: The cellular and viral proteomes of VACV IHD-W infected HEK293 cells, UV-inactivated VACV IHD-W-treated as well as non-infected cells were compared. Derivatization of peptides with 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC) carried out on ZipTip-C18 columns enabled protein identification via the peptides' primary sequence, providing improved s/n ratios as well as signal intensities of the PSD spectra. The expression of more than 24 human proteins was modulated by the viral infection. Effects of UV-inactivated and infectious viruses on the hosts' proteome concerning energy metabolism and proteins associated with gene expression and protein-biosynthesis were quite similar. These effects might therefore be attributed to virus entry and virion proteins. However, the modulation of proteins involved in apoptosis was clearly correlated to infectious viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The proteome analysis of infected cells provides insight into apoptosis modulation, regulation of cellular gene expression and the regulation of energy metabolism. The confidence of protein identifications was clearly improved by the peptides' derivatization with SPITC on a solid phase support. Some of the identified proteins have not been described in the context of poxvirus infections before and need to be further characterised to identify their meaning for apoptosis modulation and pathogenesis.","output":"Proteome analysis of vaccinia virus IHD-W-infected HEK 293 cells with 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-PSD-TOF MS of on solid phase support N-terminally sulfonated peptides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Assessing hospital mortality and its predictors is important as some of these can be prevented through appropriate interventions.

Research was conducted in the middle of April 2020. Participants. 56 people, residents of Russia (8% of men, 92% of women) from 20-23 years old university students of the 2nd (77%) and 5th (23%) courses of psychological specialties (a=21.12, Me=21, SD=1.37). Measurements. The research is based on quantitative and qualitative methodology. We used the method of content analysis for written discourses about the lifestyle in connection with self-isolation and the SAN method, which allows one to draw conclusions about the degree of psycho-emotional state. Results. Lifestyle changes were recorded by 93% of respondents. The most transformed spheres are activity (educational) and social. The spatio-temporal characteristics of life are of great importance. Assessments of negative and positive changes show parity. Minor manifestations of anxiety and negative emotional states were revealed. The average and medium-high level of psychoemotional state was recorded. Conclusions. Resources for overcoming difficulties are represented by strategies: 1) \\"I\\": comprehension, self-organization, maintaining physical fitness, self-development;2) \\"Others\\": help, emotional support for loved ones and strangers;3) \\"Living space\\": working with the space of the house for arrangement under his \\"I\\", expanding its multifunctionality, maintaining cleanliness. ? 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

Confirmation of viral infections, such as COVID-19, can be achieved through two general approaches: nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) or molecular tests and serological or antibody-based tests. The genetic material of the pathogen is detected in NAAT, and in serological tests, host antibodies produced in response to the pathogen are identified. Other methods of diagnosing COVID-19 include radiological imaging of the lungs and in vitro detection of viral antigens.

The coronial system in England is not suitable for close monitoring of suicide because of the frequent gap of several months before inquests are held. Methods: We used data from established systems of \\"real time surveillance\\" (RTS) of suspected suicides, in areas covering a total population of around 13 million, to examine for any increase after the first national lockdown in England. Outcomes: The average monthly number of suicides in the months before lockdown, January-March 2020, was 1257, compared to 1213 in April-October 2020 (-4%;95% CI -19% to 13%, p=059). Incidence rate ratios did not rise significantly in individual months after lockdown began and were not raised during the 2-month lockdown period April-May 2020 or the 5-month period after the easing of lockdown, June-October 2020 (IRR: 100 [08-125] and 094 [081-108]). Comparison of the suicide rates after lockdown in 2020 for the same months in selected areas in 2019 showed no difference. Interpretation: We did not find a rise in suicide in England in the months after the first national lockdown began in 2020, despite evidence of greater distress. However, a number of caveats should be noted. These are early figures and may change. Any effect of the pandemic may vary by population group or geographical area.

We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases to identify COVID-19-associated TTS case reports and evaluated patient-level demographics, clinical attributes, and outcomes. There are 12 cases reported of TTS associated with COVID-19 infection with mean age of 70.8  15.2 years (range 43C87 years) with elderly (66.6% > 60 years) female (66.6%) majority. The time interval from the first symptom to TTS was 8.3  3.6 days (range 3C14 days). Out of 12 cases, 7 reported apical ballooning, 4 reported basal segment hypo/akinesia, and 1 reported median TTS. Out of 12 cases, during hospitalization, data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reported in only 9 of the cases. The mean LVEF was 40.6  9.9% (male, 46.7  5.7%, and female, 37.7  10.6%). Troponin was measured in all 12 cases and was elevated in 11 (91.6%) without stenosis on coronary angiography except one. Out of 11 cases, 6 developed cardiac complications with 1 case each of cardiac tamponade, heart failure, myocarditis, hypertensive crisis, and cardiogenic shock in 2. Five patients required intubation, 1 patient required continuous positive airway pressure, and 1 patient required venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The outcome was reported in terms of recovery in 11 (91.6%) out of 12 cases, and a successful recovery was noted in 10 (90.9%) cases. COVID-19-related TTS has a higher prevalence in older women.

One of the groups that is considered high risk in this pandemic are cancer patients as they are treated with a variety of immune system suppressor treatment modalities and this puts them in a great risk for infectious disease (including COVID-19). Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic. Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever. This article provides the recommendations and possible actions that should be considered by patients, their caregivers and families, physician, nurses, managers and staff of medical centers involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment. We pursued two major goals in our recommendations: first, limiting the exposure of cancer patients to medical environments and second, modifying the treatment modalities in a manner that reduces the probability of myelosuppression such as delaying elective diagnostic and therapeutic services, shortening the treatment course, or prolonging the interval between treatment courses.","output":"COVID19 Prevention & Care; A Cancer Specific Guideline."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an empirical case study of impacts of COVID\\\\19 on Australias wine sector.

The scope includes QALYs lost to symptoms, but not deaths, due to acute COVID-19 and long COVID. Methods The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19, encompassing acute symptoms and long-COVID symptoms, was modelled using a decay function. Permanent injury as a result of COVID-19 infection, was modelled as a fixed prevalence. Both parts are combined to calculate QALY loss due to COVID-19 symptoms. Results Assuming a 60% final attack rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population, we modelled 299,719 QALYs lost within 1 year of infection (90% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 10% permanent injury) and 557,754 QALYs lost within 10 years of infection (49% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 51% due to permanent injury). The UK Government willingness-to-pay to avoid these QALY losses would be {pound}17.9 billion and {pound}32.2 billion, respectively. Additionally, 90,143 people were subject to permanent injury from COVID-19 (0.14% of the population). Conclusion Given the ongoing development in information in this area, we present a model framework for calculating the health economic impacts of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model framework can aid in quantifying the adverse health impact of COVID-19, long COVID and permanent injury following COVID-19 in society and assist the proactive management of risk posed to health.

Mental health is assessed by the validated PHQ-4 instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety. About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential implications of the virus for respondents' own health and social distancing also predicted increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic in the US, albeit less strongly. Our findings point towards the possibility of a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic, with economic concerns being a key driving force of this crisis. These results highlight the likely importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response.","output":"Predictors of mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic in the US: Role of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, which causes coronavirus disease 2019, there is a recognized need to expand critical care services and beds beyond the traditional boundaries. There is considerable concern that widespread infection will result in a surge of critically ill patients that will overwhelm our present adult ICU capacity. In this setting, one proposal to add surge capacity has been the use of PICU beds and physicians to care for these critically ill adults. DESIGN: Narrative review/perspective. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENTS: Not applicable. INTERVENTIONS: None.

Identifying factors that protect against the onset of psychopathology in the face of these stressors is critical. We examine a wide range of factors that may protect youth from developing psychopathology during the pandemic. We assessed pandemic-related stressors, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and potential protective factors by combining two longitudinal samples of children and adolescents (N = 224, 7C10 and 13C15 years) assessed prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home orders, and six months later. We evaluated how family behaviors during the stay-at-home orders were related to changes in psychopathology during the pandemic, identified factors that moderate the association of pandemic-related stressors with psychopathology, and determined whether associations varied by age. Internalizing and externalizing psychopathology increased substantially during the pandemic. Higher exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms early in the pandemic and six months later. Having a structured routine, less passive screen time, lower exposure to news media about the pandemic, and to a lesser extent more time in nature and getting adequate sleep were associated with reduced psychopathology. The association between pandemic-related stressors and psychopathology was reduced for youths with limited passive screen time and was absent for children, but not adolescents, with lower news media consumption related to the pandemic. We provide insight into simple, practical steps families can take to promote resilience against mental health problems in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic and protect against psychopathology following pandemic-related stressors.","output":"Promoting youth mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To report our experiences screening and managing patients with suspected or confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease using a hospital-specific protocol.

Sustained inflations (SI) and dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were assessed in clinical and animal studies to define the optimal level. Our working hypothesis was that very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) < 32 weeks gestation require an individualized lung recruitment based on combining both manoeuvers. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 91 and 72 inborn VLGAI, requiring a respiratory support beyond a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) = 5 cmH2O, were enrolled before and after introducing these manoeuvers based on progressive increase in SI up to 15 s, with simultaneous gradual increase in PEEP up to 15 cmH2O, according to the cardiorespiratory response. Retrospective comparisons of the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) < 72 h of life, short-term and before discharge morbidity were then performed. RESULTS: Among extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) < 29 weeks gestation, the following outcomes decreased significantly: intubation (90 to 55%) and surfactant administration (54 to 12%) in the delivery room, MV (92 to 71%) and its mean duration < 72 h of life (45 h to 13 h), administration of a 2nd dose of surfactant (35 to 12%) and postnatal corticosteroids (52 to 19%), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 to 5%). Among VLGAI, all of these results were also significant. Neonatal mortality and morbidity were not different.

We performed a retrospective study analyzing the serum levels of the cardiovascular biomarkers N-terminal pro-B natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) and pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), in 84 patients with COVID-19. Methods: Patients were divided in three groups according to their RT-qPCR and IgG values in acute infection (n=35), early infection (n=25) or control subjects (n=24). Levels of biomarkers were analyzed in patients serum samples by commercially available ELISA kits. Results: Multivariate analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showed that IMA and PAPP-A, had an excellent discrimination value for the early stage of COVID-19. Serum levels of IMA in early SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly higher than in the control group with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.881- 0.999). Likewise, the serum level of PAPP-A was significantly higher in patients with early infection than in controls [AUC = 0.801 (95% CI: 0.673C0.929)]. The combined use of IMA and PAPP-A enhanced the sensitivity for total SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to 93%. Conclusions: These results suggest that the levels of PAPP-A and IMA might be used as efficient biomarkers for the early stage of COVID-19 with high sensitivity and specificity.

METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized.

Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals. Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing. All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT). Olfactory evaluations (SniffinSticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course. Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study. Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline SniffinSticks tests.

The increase of SniffinSticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p &lt;0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months. Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients. This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p &lt;0.001). There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms.

A validation PheWAS was conducted in 2,247 white individuals from the CATHGEN. ResultsFour of the ten tested genetic loci showed significant phenotypic associations in UK Biobank after FDR adjustment. Vascular dementia significantly associated with rs7271165 near TMEM65 on 8q24.13 in individuals with the C risk allele (OR 5.66 [95% CI 2.21-11.85], q=0.049).

Despite decades of telemedicine in clinical practice, it is rare to find it used in small-metro and academic settings. Following the decision to limit face-to-face care, we tracked our practice's transition to telemedicine. METHODS: This was a prospective quality improvement project following Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to optimize the use of telemedicine (both telephone and video in this practice) encounters. Central to the PDSA cycles was the use of a post-encounter questionnaire to track patient, appointment, and physician factors. Throughout the cycles, inferential statistics were used to inform process improvement. RESULTS: In Cycle 2, a logistic regression model showed length of encounter, need for physical examination, and physician satisfaction correctly predicted a physician's preferred medium (&#967;2(3) = 40.56, P < .001). In Cycle 3, a &#967;2 test showed the reason for visit predicted the preferred medium (&#967;2(4) = 47.30, P < .001). In cycle 4, week of telemedicine, need for physical examination, length of encounter and physician satisfaction predicted the preferred medium (&#967;2(9) = 172.52, P < .001). DISCUSSION: Using the variables that predicted preference for telemedicine, we were able to adjust our processes through PDSA cycles. CONCLUSION: Early use of the PDSA cycle allows for informed quality improvement at the local level. Our findings highlight factors to consider when implementing telemedicine such as need for physical examination and type or length of encounter. In addition, physician satisfaction can encourage use of telemedicine, and tools for learning and practicing telemedicine should be available.","output":"A Stepwise Transition to Telemedicine in Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on a comparative analysis of gated communities in Shanghai, China and in Bogot, Colombia, this chapter investigates weaknesses and patterns of urban resilience against the current COVID-19 outbreak, arising from the functional and spatial organization of these residential settlements.

METHODS: A cohort study was conducted that included patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated with negative RNA conversion. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR) 17-32 days). The shortest duration was 9 days and the longest was 58 days. Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA were symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath (hazard ratio (HR) 0.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.401-0.897) and face mask use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228).

Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the process-from administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicine's lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers.

In order to address the challenges in analyzing this complex process, we developed a competing risk compartmental model framework with and without vaccination compartment. This framework separates instantaneous risk of removal for an infectious case into competing risks of cure and death, and when vaccinations are present, the vaccinated individual can also achieve immunity before infection. Computations are performed using a simple discrete time algorithm that utilizes a data driven contact rate. Using population level pre-vaccination data, we are able to identify and characterize three wave patterns in the U.S. Estimated mortality rates for second and third waves are 1.7%, which is a notable decrease from 8.5% of a first wave observed at onset of disease. This analysis reveals the importance cure time has on infectious duration and disease transmission. Using vaccination data from 2021, we find a fourth wave, however the effect of this wave is suppressed due to vaccine effectiveness.

This work has particular relevance given the pressing public health need to enhance testing capacity for coronavirus disease 2019 and future pandemics, and the need for wide-scale and repeated testing for surveillance under constantly varying conditions. The proposed Bayesian approach allows for dilution effects in group testing and for general test response distributions beyond just binary outcomes. It is shown that even under strong dilution effects, an intuitive group testing selection rule that relies on the model order structure, referred to as the Bayesian halving algorithm, has attractive optimal convergence properties. Analogous look-ahead rules that can reduce the number of stages in classification by selecting several pooled tests at a time are proposed and evaluated as well. Group testing is demonstrated to provide great savings over individual testing in the number of tests needed, even for moderately high prevalence levels. However, there is a trade-off with higher number of testing stages, and increased variability. A web-based calculator is introduced to assist in weighing these factors and to guide decisions on when and how to pool under various conditions.

The aim of this survival study is to evaluate pure (totally) transvaginal NOTES bacterial contamination compared with laparoscopy in pigs. METHODS Twelve adult female pigs underwent peritoneoscopy with liver and peritoneal biopsies, using either laparoscopy (Glap, six animals) or pure transvaginal (GNOTES) access, and were maintained alive for 7 days. In all animals, blood cultures were taken at baseline, and after 24 h and 7 days postoperatively. Swab cultures from vagina (GNOTES) and skin (Glap) were obtained pre- and post-antisepsis. Peritoneal fluid culture was obtained at necropsy. For statistical analysis, Glap and GNOTES were compared for presence of positive bacterial cultures (qualitative bacterial analysis) using Fisher's test, with level of significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS All animals had good postoperative outcome. One animal had transient perioperative bleeding from a transvaginal access. Two animals in Glap and one in GNOTES had positive blood cultures after the procedure. All animals from GNOTES and Glap presented with mixed flora pre-antisepsis. After antisepsis, one animal (GNOTES) presented with a positive vaginal swab culture (a single bacterial strain was identified). There was no positive skin swab culture in Glap. There were no signs of intra-abdominal infection at necropsy. In two animals, one from Glap and another from GNOTES, intra-abdominal culture was positive for Corynebacterium spp. and Escherichia coli, respectively. There was no correlation between the bacterial flora found at the access site and in the peritoneal cultures. CONCLUSIONS Pure transvaginal peritoneoscopy with liver and peritoneal biopsy in swine is feasible and associated with bacterial contamination comparable to laparoscopy.

Early and structured rehabilitation has been associated with improved outcomes for patients requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, but at present no data are available to describe similar interventions or outcomes in COVID-19 populations. Objectives: To describe the demographics, clinical status, level of rehabilitation, and mobility status at ICU discharge of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Adults admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and mechanically ventilated for >24 hours were included. Rehabilitation status was measured daily using the Manchester Mobility Score to identify the time taken to first mobilize (defined as sitting on the edge of the bed or higher) and highest level of mobility achieved at ICU discharge. Results: A total of n = 177 patients were identified, of whom n = 110 survived to ICU discharge and were included in the subsequent analysis. While on ICU, patients required prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 19  10 d), most received neuromuscular blockade (90%) and 67% were placed in the prone position on at least one occasion. The mean  standard deviation time to first mobilize was 14  7 days, with a median Manchester Mobility Score at ICU discharge of 5 (interquartile range: 4C6), which represents participants able to stand and step around to a chair with or without assistance. Time to mobilize was significantly longer in those with higher body mass index (P < 0.001), and older patients (P = 0.012) and those with more comorbidities (P = 0.017) were more likely to require further rehabilitation after discharge. Conclusions: The early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom resembles the experience in other countries, with high acuity of illness and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation required for those patients admitted to the ICU. Although the time to commence rehabilitation was delayed owing to this severity of illness, rehabilitation was possible within the ICU and led to increased levels of mobility from waking before ICU discharge.

However, given the prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B in many countries and the incidence of new cases of acute Hepatitis B, the task is not easy. This study investigates the trends and determinants of the incidence of acute Hepatitis B in Poland in 2005C2019. Materials and Methods: Data on the incidence of acute hepatitis B (AHBV) were obtained from the National Institute of Public Health. A case definition for AHBV was consistent with the EU definition. The incidence trends were determined by considering the sex, age and place of residence. Due to the exponential dependence model, the computations were based on the logarithm of the incidence rate. This allowed for the transformation to linear form and analysis could be conducted using linear models. Pearsons correlation was used to determine the linear trend of incidence in general and according to sex and place of residence. The values of incidence rates (independent proportions test) and the coefficients illustrating the trends under study were also compared among males and females as well as urban and rural residents. Results: The incidence of AHBV in the Polish population decreased with similar slopes in both sexes. The newly reported cases of AHBV were more frequent in the male population. The incidence of acute Hepatitis B in the urban population was significantly higher than in the rural population. The significant decreasing trends in incidence were observed in all age ranges, with the exception of two age ranges 0C4 and 10C14, where the total incidence during the whole study period was negligible. Conclusion: Despite the significant decrease in the incidence of AHBV in Poland and its position among the European countries with the lowest hepatitis B (HBV) incidence, the alarmingly high proportion of iatrogenic infections requires further improvement in the sanitary condition of health care facilities. It is also necessary to decrease the number of unvaccinated individuals.","output":"Trends in the Incidence of Acute Hepatitis B in the Polish Population and Their Determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines a broad range of driving factors of credit expansion using long-term cross-country panel data from 1994 to 2018 and the System GMM method.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer levels based on presentation in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHOD The study was conducted on patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 11 and April 20, 2020. Patients with diseases that could have caused an increase in D-dimer were excluded from the study. RESULTS The evaluation was made across a total of 1,669 patients, comprising 782 (46.9 %) females and 887 (53.1 %) males. The effects of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and troponin on mortality were evaluated with Enter Logistic Regression Analysis, and the model was found to be significant, with an explanatory coefficient of the model at a very good level of 91.3 %. The D-dimer scores were determined to be higher in patients who did not survive. The risk of mortality was seen to be 7.325-fold higher in cases with D-dimer measurement 0.5. CONCLUSION The study results showed that the D-dimer test was an independent risk factor showing mortality in COVID-19 patients (Tab. 6, Ref. 27).

METHODS Participants were premenopausal women (N = 183). Path models evaluated whether early life trauma predicted early pubertal timing and thereby, adult epigenetic age acceleration (indexed via four epigenetic clocks: Horvath DNAm Age, Hannum DNAm Age, DNAm PhenoAge, and DNAm GrimAge). Secondary analyses explored the effects of type of trauma (abuse and neglect) and adult chronic stress status (caregiver of child with autism and non-caregiver). RESULTS Early life trauma and earlier age at menarche independently predicted accelerated aging based on one of the four epigenetic clocks, DNAm GrimAge, though early life trauma was not associated with age of menarche. Childhood abuse, but not neglect, predicted faster epigenetic aging; results did not differ by chronic stress status. CONCLUSIONS Early trauma and early menarche appear to exert independent effects on DNAm GrimAge, which has been shown to be the strongest epigenetic predictor of mortality risk. This study identifies a potential correlate or determinant of accelerated epigenetic aging-menarcheal age. Future research should address the limitations of this study by using racially diverse samples.","output":"Early life adversity, pubertal timing, and epigenetic age acceleration in adulthood."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND When appropriately selected, a high proportion of patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) will respond to cerebrospinal fluid diversion with a shunt. Extended lumbar drainage (ELD) is regarded as the most accurate test for this condition, however, varying estimates of its accuracy are found in the current literature. Here, we review the literature in order to provide summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive value for this test through meta-analysis of suitably rigorous studies. METHODS Studies involving a population of NPH patients with predominantly idiopathic aetiology (>80%) in which the intention of the study was to shunt patients regardless of the outcome of ELD were included in the review. Various literature databases were searched to identify diagnostic test accuracy studies addressing ELD in the diagnosis of iNPH. Those studies passing screening and eligibility were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool and data extracted for bivariate random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Four small studies were identified. They showed disparate results concerning diagnostic test accuracy. The summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 94% (CI 41-100%) and 85% (CI 33-100%), respectively. The summary estimates of positive and negative predictive value were both 90% (CIs 65-100% and 48-100%, respectively). CONCLUSION Large, rigorous studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of ELD are lacking, and little robust evidence exists to support the use of ELD in diagnostic algorithms for iNPH. Therefore, a large cohort study, or ideally an RCT, is needed to determine best practice in selecting patients for shunt surgery.","output":"Extended lumbar drainage in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a recent, unprecedented interest in the role of gut microbiota in host health and disease.

The ABO blood group antigens are the most frequently studied genetic markers. Reports from China and USA have shown that people with blood group A are more susceptible to COVID- 19 while those with blood group O are least susceptible. METHODS: The ABO blood group of 51 patients with COVID-19 admitted at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Nigeria was determined and compared with the ABO blood group distribution in the general population. RESULTS: Out of the 51 patients, 39 (76.5%) were males and 12 (23.5%) were females, giving a male: female ratio of 3.25:1. Out of the 51 patients, 29 (56.9%) had blood group O, 12 (23.5%) had blood group A, 10 (19.6%) had blood group B and none (0%) had blood group AB. This blood group distribution was comparable to the blood group distribution in the general population. CONCLUSION: Preliminary analysis of the blood group distribution of COVID-19 patients being managed at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Nigeria found no relationship between COVID-19 and ABO blood group.

Our aim was to understand which COVID-19-related questions predicted mental well-being during the outbreak. METHODS: Two cross-sectional datasets were used. The primary dataset was collected in May 2020 (n = 1001), during the initial COVID-19 outbreak, and the secondary in April 2019 (n = 10866), before the pandemic. Mental well-being was assessed with the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. Relationships between mental well-being and COVID-19-related questions were investigated with lasso regression. As an exploratory analysis, two-way ANOVAs were used to compare mental well-being before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: Higher levels of mental well-being were associated with lower levels of academic stress and COVID-19-related worry, along with a higher satisfaction with the procedures and information provided by the higher education institutions and the government. COVID-19-related symptoms and infections did not have an impact on students' mental well-being during the outbreak. Small to moderate effect sizes across the time points were detected, indicating an overall decrease in mental well-being across age and gender during the outbreak.

In recent years, however, the premise that scientific research and knowledge should be free from substantive regulation has increasingly been called into question. Some have suggested that the law should be used as a tool to substantively restrict research which is dual-use in nature or which raises moral objections. There are, however, some problems with using law to restrict or prohibit certain types of scientific research, including (i) the inherent imprecision of law for regulating complex and rapidly evolving scientific research; (ii) the difficulties of enforcing legal restrictions on an activity that is international in scope; (iii) the limited predictability of the consequences of restricting specific branches of scientific research; (iv) inertia in the legislative process; and (v) the susceptibility of legislators and regulators to inappropriate factors and influence.

Although less than 5% of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, one in five cases reported to police are deemed baseless (by police) and therefore coded as \\"unfounded.\\" Police officers are in a unique position to act as gatekeepers for justice in sexual assault cases, given their responsibility to investigate sexual assault reports. However, high rates of unfounded sexual assaults reveal that dismissing sexual violence has become common practice amongst the police. Much of the research on unfounded sexual assault is based on police perceptions of the sexual assault, as indicated in police reports. Women's perspectives about their experiences with police are not represented in research. This qualitative study explored women's experiences when their sexual assault report was disbelieved by the police. Data collection included open-ended and semi-structured interviews with 23 sexual assault survivors. Interviews covered four areas including the sexual assault, the experience with the police, the experience of not being believed, and the impact on their health and well-being. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVIVO for analysis. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's analytic method, resulting in the identification of four themes, including, (a) vulnerability, (b) drug and alcohol use during the assault, (c) police insensitivity, and (d) police process. The women in this study who experienced a sexual assault and reported the assault to police were hopeful that police would help them and justice would be served. Instead, these women were faced with insensitivity, blaming questions, lack of investigation, and lack of follow-up from the police, all of which contributed to not being believed by the institutions designed to protect them. The findings from this research demonstrate that police officers must gain a deeper understanding of trauma and sensitive communication with survivors of sexual assault.","output":"Unfounded Sexual Assault: Women's Experiences of Not Being Believed by the Police."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erythroferrone is a recently identified erythroid regulator produced by erythroblasts in the mammalian bone marrow and extramedullary sites, known to be induced in conditions of anemia or blood loss. Iron metabolism is affected by erythroferrone through its capacity to inhibit hepcidin production, leading to the increase of iron availability required for erythropoiesis. However, little is known about erythroferrone function in other vertebrates, in particular teleost fish, that unlike mammals, present two different functional types of hepcidin, one type mostly involved in iron metabolism and the other in antimicrobial response. The study of erythroferrone evolution and its biological role in teleost fish can give us valuably new insights into its function. To address these questions, we characterized erythroferrone in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a species presenting two hepcidin types, and evaluated variations in its expression levels in response to different experimental conditions. During experimental anemia, erythroferrone responds by increasing its expression and suppressing hepcidin production, following the pattern observed in mammals, but it is not influenced by iron overload. However, during bacterial infection, erythroferrone is downregulated and hepcidin levels increase. Furthermore, administration of Hamp1 but not of Hamp2 peptides suppresses erythroferrone expression. In conclusion, in dual hepcidin teleost fish erythroferrone seems to only interact with type 1 hepcidin, known to be involved in iron homeostasis, but not with type 2, which has an almost exclusive antimicrobial role.","output":"Characterization of Erythroferrone in a Teleost Fish (Dicentrarchus labrax) With Two Functional Hepcidin Types: More Than an Erythroid Regulator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18C55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5  10(10) viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT(50)]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA(50), MNA(80), and MNA(90)]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon- enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606. FINDINGS: Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<005). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493C1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96C317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360C792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA(80) and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT(50). After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA(80) at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R(2)=067 by Marburg VN; p<0001). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.

Early in the pandemic, our health system created an admission order set which included daily d-dimer, c-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin. Given more available outcomes data, limiting standing order of studies that do not affect daily management could result in significant cost savings to the health system without adverse patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine ordering and utilization patterns of inflammatory markers by physicians caring for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infections. [Image: see text] METHODS: An anonymous 10-question survey was distributed to 125 physicians (Infectious Diseases, Hospitalist, Pulmonary and Critical Care faculty). Responses were tallied and values greater than 50% were identified as the majority of the surveyed group. [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of the 125 physicians surveyed, 77 (62%) responded. A total of 57.1% (44/77) of physicians reported ordering daily inflammatory markers for 3-10 days from admission. Another 31.2% (24/77) ordered markers until clinical improvement or hospital discharge. D-dimer was used for care decisions by 83.1% (64/77) of respondents; 93.8% (60/64) of those reported utilizing it in determining anticoagulation dose. CRP was used by 61% (47/77) of physicians to help identify a secondary infection or determine steroid dose or duration. LDH and ferritin were not used for management decisions by the majority of physicians. Inflammatory markers were not used routinely after isolation precautions had been discontinued, even when ongoing care required mechanical ventilation. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Of the markers studied, both d-dimer and CRP were considered useful by most respondents. LDH and ferritin were used less frequently and were not considered as useful in guiding medical decision making. Discontinuation of standing daily LDH and ferritin orders is believed to have potential to result in cost savings to the health care system with no adverse patient outcomes.

Complete devascularization (n = 10; 91 %) or 95 % devascularization (n = 1; 9 %) led to complete resolution (n = 8; 73 %) or improvement of clinical symptoms (n = 3; 27 %). One minor complication occurred (pain and swelling). During a mean follow-up time of 8 months, one clinically asymptomatic recurrence of AVM was detected.

A systematic scoping review and qualitative analysis of scientific papers (N = 53) described the state of the art in remote public engagement in coastal CS. The analysis revealed unique advantages of remote engagement in coastal CS, including flexibility, social inclusivity, and organised communication management. Challenges, mainly associated with technology, could be solved by simplifying interfaces to streamline communication and participation in CS. The review identified research gaps and confirmed the potentially positive contribution of remote engagement in coastal CS, which could enhance coastal monitoring, management, public participation, and stewardship.","output":"Remote Public Engagement in Coastal Citizen Science: A Systematic Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health is a cross-border issue, recently demonstrated by the COVID-19 public health crisis. Now more than ever, the healthiness of European populations requires the use of the full capacity of the European research community to generate evidence in these uncertain times for better health system preparedness and pragmatic approaches to interventions in the health care system. However, data on population health is fragmented across institutions, projects and research networks.

Some states have not yet started and may still be exploring the feasibility of integrating BMD within their asphalt pavement program, while others have already moved forward with implementation activities and are currently at different stages of the implementation process. The latter have valuable experience and lessons learned that could facilitate the implementation of a BMD program into practice to improve long-term pavement durability and performance. Thus, an effort was initiated to identify and put forward positive practices from state DOTs when implementing BMD and performance testing of asphalt mixtures. To accomplish this objective, information was collected through virtual site visits, and other means made necessary by the coronavirus pandemic, with seven key state DOTs. As a result of this effort, it was identified that five state DOTs out of seven use Approach A for the BMD process as defined in AASHTO PP 105-20, and one state DOT uses a combination of Approach A and Approach B. One state DOT also allows for Approach C while another state DOT allows for Approach D. Eight major tasks for the overall process for implementing BMD as part of mixture design approval and acceptance are established, and positive practices with examples for each task are provided. Those successful efforts used by state DOTs could be considered by other state DOTs in their effort to implement BMD within their asphalt pavement program.","output":"Examples of Successful Practices with State Implementation of Balanced Design of Asphalt Mixtures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research I seek to understand the efficacy of Twitter as a platform for serial transmission of a crisis communications.

My results suggest that systematic differences do exist in the social media presence for state health departments. These differences, as well as the characteristics of the tweets they sent during the pandemic help explain the total number of people exposed to their messages such that short, frequent messages with URLs from departments with high social presence reaching the largest number of users per week.

EMCV VP1 protein was one of the most important structural proteins and played an important role in the protective immunity. In this study, 10 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against EMCV VP1 were screened and identified. RESULTS: Epitope mapping results indicated that McAbs (6E11, 7A7, 7C9) specifically recognized the linear epitopes V(2)ENAEK(7), McAbs (1D1, 2A2, 5A1, 5A11, 5G1) recognized the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25), and McAbs 1G8 and 3A9 recognized P(42)IGAFTVK(49). Protein sequence alignment of VP1 with 16 EMCV isolates indicated that the epitope F(19)VAQPVY(25) was conserved in all the reference strains. The epitopes P(42)IGAFTVK(49) and V(2)ENAEK(7) only had 1 or 2 variable amino acid among the reference strains.

In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","output":"Logistical Considerations and Clinical Outcomes Associated with Converting Operating Rooms into an Intensive Care Unit during the Covid-19 Pandemic in a New York City Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is recent evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19, but it is also possible that this cytokine may have a far more important role in the pathogenesis of viral infection. IL-6 is known to be modulated by Vitamin D, and there is preliminary evidence that deficiency of this vitamin is linked to poorer outcomes. To identify whether IL-6 levels prior to infection might predict outcome, early data on COVID-19 mortality from Italy and the UK were compared with previously published results of mean IL-6 levels from these countries as well as from the USA. There was a highly significant correlation (r = 0.9883; p = 0.00025) between age-stratified mortality rates and IL-6 levels from previously published data on healthy individuals. To determine whether Vitamin D may be beneficial at lowering IL-6 levels in patients, a limited analysis of trials examining the relationship between these entities published since 2015 was undertaken. Eight out of 11 studies described a significant lowering effect of Vitamin D on IL-6. Given that IL-6 likely facilitates viral cell entry and replication, levels prior to infection may predict mortality. This provides a rationale for prophylactic and therapeutic measures directed at lowering IL-6, including Vitamin D prescription.","output":"Correlation between premorbid IL-6 levels and COVID-19 mortality: Potential role for Vitamin D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were: to investigate the capacity of the rare disease healthcare network in Campania to diagnose patients with rare diseases during the outbreak of Covid-19; and to shed light on problematic diagnoses during this period.

Anosmia has been a neglected symptom in the primary healthcare setting until the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted new atypical symptoms of the disease, including anosmia, which has become one of the diagnostic symptoms of the disease, and epidemiological concern. We aimed to detect the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within patients presented with anosmia and to test for other respiratory viruses in the negative COVID-19 patients. We also detected the recovery of anosmia and IgM/IgG against COVID-19. We prospectively included 60 outpatients with the major complaint of anosmia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were done for SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR, and if negative, PCR to other respiratory pathogens was tested. After one month, we inquired about the recovery of smell loss together with testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled in the study. Forty-six patients (76.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 14 (23.3%) were negative. Rhinovirus was the commonest isolated pathogen in the negative cases (5/14). Complete recovery of anosmia occurred in 34 patients (56.7%), while partial recovery in 24 (40.0%), and no recovery in 2 patients (3.3%).

A SPN is defined as a single lung opacity of less than 3cm in size. They present a diagnostic dilemma as differentials are broad and range from benign to malignant. Here, we present a case of a SPN in an patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Description: A 33 year-old female with history of recreational marijuana use presented to the hospital with right-sided flank pain, dysuria, fevers, and nausea for four days. Upon presentation, she was afebrile with stable vital signs and SpO2 97% on ambient air. Physical exam was remarkable only for flank and suprapubic tenderness. A diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made and confirmed with CT of the abdomen which also detected a left lower lobe subpleural nodular consolidation. Follow-up chest CT better characterized the lesion as a 2.2 x 1.2 cm ground glass opacity (GGO) in the posterior left lower lobe without effusion, pneumothorax, or regional lymphadenopathy. Coccidioides serology was negative, however, routine COVID-19 testing found the patient to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. She underwent successful treatment for pyelonephritis and was discharged with instructions to follow up in pulmonology clinic. At follow up, she denied any interval development of respiratory symptoms. Repeat chest CT four months later showed complete resolution of the lesion and she was discharged from pulmonology clinic. Discussion: Since the advent of COVID-19, a plethora of radiologic findings have been noted in patients with known infections. Chest CT offers insight into clinical staging of diseas e and temporal evolutions of CT findings correlate with disease severity. Typical features include bilateral peripheral GGO, crazy paving pattern, airspace consolidations, traction bronchiectasis, and bronchovascular thickening. Atypical findings include mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, multiple small nodules, tree-in-bud, pneumothorax, and cavitation. Though not typical and seemingly underreported, a SPN may also indicate a very early infectious stage in the absence of respiratory symptoms. For our patient, Fleischner guidelines suggest a follow-up CT at 6-12 months but such a strategy would surely fail to detect development of pneumonia given the speed at which COVID-19 progresses, and possibly miss the window on early outpatient interventions and infection prevention. Instead, this case highlights the importance of shorter interval repeat chest imaging in patients with incidental SPN and SARS-CoV-2 infection as a means to monitor for resolution or progression requiring further evaluation and treatment.","output":"An Unusual Case of a COVID19-Associated Solitary Pulmonary Nodule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In present study, it was proposed to compare the physical education teachers' and other branch teachers' stress and anxiety levels. 155 physical education (sport) teachers and 126 teachers from other branch, working in the province of Izmir participated in the study voluntarily.

In this work, we propose a multi-stage attentive transfer learning framework for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. Our proposed framework consists of three stages to train accurate diagnosis models through learning knowledge from multiple source tasks and data of different domains. Importantly, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to learn multi-scale representations for lung CT images. Our method captures semantic information from the whole lung and highlights the functionality of each lung region for better representation learning. The method is then integrated to the last stage of the proposed transfer learning framework to reuse the complex patterns learned from the same CT images. We use a base model integrating self-attention (ATTNs) and convolutional operations. Experimental results show that networks with ATTNs induce greater performance improvement through transfer learning than networks without ATTNs. This indicates attention exhibits higher transferability than convolution. Our results also show that the proposed self-supervised learning method outperforms several baseline methods.","output":"A Multi-Stage Attentive Transfer Learning Framework for Improving COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s11071-021-06320-7.].","output":"Correction to: Modelling personal cautiousness during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study for Turkey and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To date, only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remains conflicting. Methods: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until February 28th, 2021, for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were mortality at 28 days, mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation or mortality and time to discharge. Results: Eight studies (with 6,311 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3,267 patients received tocilizumab, and 3,044 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of mortality at 28 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97, p=0.009) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90, p=0.0002) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo.

However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. OBJECTIVES: The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a childrens hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. RESULTS: Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","output":"Seasonal variations of respiratory viruses and etiology of human rhinovirus infection in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim was to compare the laboratory data of patients with suspected and confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and look for diagnostic predictive and early warning indicators, which will help to better manage the disease.

The suspected group enrolled 23 suspected COVID-19 patients with the negative nucleic acid test result. We collected all patients' clinical characteristics and some laboratory indicators at the time of admission and conducted Logistic regression analysis after comparing the differences between groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, gender, disease duration, fever history, and comorbidities between the suspected and general group (P > 0.05); however, fibrinogen was statistically different (P < 0.05). Compared with the general group, the oxygenation index and lymphocytes were significantly reduced and the Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and total bilirubin were increased in the critical group (P < 0.05). The fibrinogen OR value was 2.52 (95% CI 1.18-5.36, P = 0.017) and the NLR OR value was 2.91 (95% CI 1.36-6.21, P = 0.006).

Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the COVID-19 suspected (positive and negative tested group) with the COVID-19 not suspected (control group) and to compare in the COVID-19 suspected group, the positive and negative tested patients. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either COVID-19 suspected (positive and negative tested group) or COVID-19 not suspected (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed.

Validation was performed for 254 scenes recorded for various cloudy and surface conditions and vapor contents. The overall percentages of false alarms and omissions for these validation images were 5.37% and 7.80%, respectively. Limited to the resolution of Landsat data, cloud, the size and flight altitude of the aircraft, 42.99% flying aircraft were undetected compared with the FlightRadar24. Instead of using the Google Earth Engine, we employed more flexible cloud computing techniques, Google Cloud Storage and Google Calculation Engine, to construct our framework for the larger volume data.

Several genera belong to this family, including the Hepacivirus genus, of which hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the prototype member, and the Flavivirus genus, which contains both dengue virus and Zika virus. Viruses of these genera differ in many respects, such as the mode of transmission or the course of infection, which is either predominantly persistent in the case of HCV or acutely self-limiting in the case of flaviviruses. Although the fundamental replication strategy of Flaviviridae members is similar, during the past few years, important differences have been discovered, including the way in which these viruses exploit cellular resources to facilitate viral propagation. These differences might be responsible, at least in part, for the various biological properties of these viruses, thus offering the possibility to learn from comparisons. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how Flaviviridae viruses manipulate and usurp cellular pathways in infected cells. Specifically, we focus on comparing strategies employed by flaviviruses with those employed by hepaciviruses, and we discuss the importance of these interactions in the context of viral replication and antiviral therapies.

It enables the public health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases from the population, thereby limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people. However, despite the significance of testing in epidemic control, the recent literature on the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this paper, an epidemic model is proposed that incorporates the testing rate as a control input and differentiates the undetected infected from the detected infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading process in the population. After estimating the model on the data corresponding to the beginning phase of COVID-19 in France, two testing policies are proposed: the so-called best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a minimum testing rate that stops the growth of the epidemic when implemented. The COST policy, on the other hand, is a mitigation strategy that provides an optimal value of testing rate minimizing the peak value of the infected population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths for the COVID-19 case of France.","output":"Modeling and Control of Epidemics through Testing Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective management of foreign-imported COVID-19 cases is a new and great challenge for China.

In the past few years, the role of systemic infection and gut dysbiosis in modulating inflammation and stroke risk has been increasingly acknowledged. In this review, we synthesize contemporary literature on the effects of infection and inflammation on stroke risk and outcomes, with a focus on periodontal disease, COVID-19 infection, and gut dysbiosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Chronic and acute infections such as periodontitis and COVID-19 induce systemic inflammation that cause atherogenesis and increase cardiac injury and arrhythmias. These infections also directly injure the endothelium leading to worsened secondary inflammation after stroke. Gut dysbiosis engenders a pro-inflammatory state by modulating intestinal lymphocyte populations that can traffic directly to the brain. Additionally, post-stroke immune dysregulation creates a compounding feedback loop of further infections and gut dysbiosis that worsen outcomes. SUMMARY: Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of how infection and dysbiosis affect the progression of stroke, as well as long-term recovery, have revealed tantalizing glimpses at potential therapeutic targets. We discuss the multidirectional relationship between stroke, infection, and gut dysbiosis, and identify areas for future research to further explore therapeutic opportunities.

Facing this most demanding of campaigns, two main approaches have been undertaken by scientists. First, the classic approach involves the development of relatively small molecules having antiviral properties to serve as drugs. The other approach involves searching for polymers with antiviral properties to be used as prescription medications or viral spread prevention measures. This second approach took two distinct directions. The first, using polymers as antiviral drug-delivery systems, taking advantage of their biodegradable properties. The second, using polymers with antiviral properties for on-contact virus elimination, which will be the focus of this review. Anti-viral polymers are obtained by either the addition of small antiviral molecules (such as metal ions) to obtain ion-containing polymers with antiviral properties or the use of polymers composed of an organic backbone and electrically charged moieties like polyanions, such as carboxylate containing polymers, or polycations such as quaternary ammonium containing polymers. Other approaches include moieties hybridized by sulphates, carboxylic acids, or amines and/or combining repeating units with a similar chemical structure to common antiviral drugs.

Serial lung and/or liver and blood samples were collected using MITS starting soon after death and every 6 hours thereafter for up to 72 hours. Bodies were stored in the mortuary refrigerator for the duration of the study. All specimens were analyzed using customized multipathogen TaqMan? array cards (TACs). RESULTS: We identified a median of 3 pathogens in each childs lung tissue (range, 1C8; n = 20), 3 pathogens in each childs liver tissue (range, 1C4; n = 5), and 2 pathogens in each childs blood specimen (range, 0C4; n = 5). Pathogens were not consistently detected across all collection time points; there was no association between postmortem interval and the number of pathogens detected (P = .43) and no change in TAC cycle threshold value over time for pathogens detected in lung tissue.

The validity and usability of this system in the uncontrolled real-life working environment of physically active workers are still unknown. The objective of this study was to test the discriminant validity of an artificial neural network-based method for load assessment during actual work. Nine physically active workers performed work-related tasks while wearing the sensor system. The main measure representing lumbar load was the net moment around the L5/S1 intervertebral body, estimated using a method that was based on artificial neural network and perceived workload. The mean differences (MDs) were tested using a paired t-test. During heavy tasks, the net moment (MD = 64.3  13.5%, p = 0.028) and the perceived workload (MD = 5.1  2.1, p < 0.001) observed were significantly higher than during the light tasks. The lumbar load had significantly higher variances during the dynamic tasks (MD = 33.5  36.8%, p = 0.026) and the perceived workload was significantly higher (MD = 2.2  1.5, p = 0.002) than during static tasks.

While many investigational, approved, and repurposed drugs have been suggested, preclinical data from animal models can guide the search for effective treatments by ruling out treatments without in vivo efficacy.

In animal models, remdesivir treatment was effective against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.(2,5,6) In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2.(7,8) Here, we investigated the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in arhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection(9). In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages 12hrs after the first treatment administration. Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. At necropsy, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were lower and there was a reduction in damage to the lungs. Thus, therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

We sought to compare the rates of PTB during the COVID pre- and post- vaccination periods with pre-pandemic rate. Study Design: Retrospective cohort comparing all deliveries over 20 weeks at a single tertiary center during early COVID (ECOVID 3/2020-6/2020) vs. late COVID (LCOVID 3/2021C6/2021), and LCOVID vs. pre-COVID (3-6/2014-2019). PTB < 37weeks, < 34weeks and < 28weeks were compared and stratified by race/ethnicity. Results: There were 20334 deliveries including 2647 ECOVID, 2114 LCOVID and 15574 pre-COVID. We noted 87 (0.03%) and 37 (0.02%) COVID infections in pregnancy during ECOVID and LCOVID, respectively. PTB rate during LCOVID (12.1%) was lower compared to ECOVID (14.5%), p=0.02. Rate of PTB < 34 was also lower during LCOVID (4.4% vs 5.7%, p=0.04). PTB < 28 did not differ (Table1). When controlling for prior PTB, LCOVID was associated with a decreased risk of PTB, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83[95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70, 0.99]. Among the small number of American Indian patients, PTB increased during LCOVID vs. ECOVID. There were no other significant differences based on race/ethnicity. Overall, PTB rates did not differ in LCOVID vs. pre-COVID. When stratified by race and ethnicity, White individuals had reduced PTB < 37 during LCOVID compared to pre-COVID, aOR 0.70 [95% CI 0.63, 0.99]. PTB rate was unchanged comparing LCOVID vs. pre-COVID in all other racial groups. Among small numbers of Hispanic Puerto Rican patients, PTB rate increased LCOVID vs. pre-COVID (Table 2).

SETTING AND RESPONDENTS: Data are drawn from a population survey of individuals in the USA and UK conducted in June 2020. BACKGROUND METHODS: Regression models are estimated for 1467 individuals in which reported evidence of infection depends on work-related factors as well as a variety of personal controls. RESULTS: The following themes emerge from the analysis. First, a range of work-related factors are significant sources of variation in COVID-19 infection as indicated by self-reports of medical diagnosis or symptoms. This includes evidence about workplace types, consultation about safety and union membership. The partial effect of transport-related employment in regression models makes the chance of infection over three times more likely while in univariate analyses, transport-related work increases the risk of infection by over 40 times in the USA. Second, there is evidence that some home-related factors are significant predictors of infection, most notably the sharing of accommodation or a kitchen. Third, there is some evidence that behavioural factors and personal traits (including risk preference, extraversion and height) are also important. CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes that predictors of transmission relate to work, transport, home and personal factors. Transport-related work settings are by far the greatest source of risk and so should be a focus of prevention policies. In addition, surveys of the sort developed in this paper are an important source of information on transmission pathways within the community.","output":"Work-related and personal predictors of COVID-19 transmission: evidence from the UK and USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Standard laparoscopic splenic flexure mobilization is often hampered by redundant small bowel and usually necessitates additional ports.

More capable agents often exploit reward misspecifications, achieving higher proxy reward and lower true reward than less capable agents. Moreover, we find instances of phase transitions: capability thresholds at which the agent's behavior qualitatively shifts, leading to a sharp decrease in the true reward. Such phase transitions pose challenges to monitoring the safety of ML systems.

METHODS: Patient evaluations were conducted at the Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin between March 11, 2020 and June 1, 2020. Patient demographics, baseline comorbidities, home medications, presenting symptoms, and outcomes were obtained via electronic medical record. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (88 men, 7 women) tested positive for COVID-19 and were evaluated. Fourteen required mechanical ventilation; 50 and 31 patients were treated in the hospital without ventilation or were discharged to home isolation, respectively. Discharged patients were younger than patients hospitalized. Most patients with COVID-19 were African American (63.2%). Patients whose disease progressed to mechanical ventilation had, on admission, more dyspnea, higher heart and respiratory rates, and lower oxygen saturation than other patients.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether facility-level fluoroquinolone use predicts healthcare facility-associated (HCFA) CDI due to fluoroquinolone-resistant 027 strains. METHODS Using a nationwide cohort of hospitalized patients in the Veterans' Affairs Healthcare System, we identified hospitals that categorized >80% of CDI cases as positive or negative for the 027 strain for at least one-quarter of fiscal years 2011-2018. Within these facilities, we used visual summaries and multilevel logistic regression models to assess the association between facility-level fluoroquinolone use and rates of HCFA-CDI due to 027 strains, controlling for time and facility complexity level, and adjusting for correlated outcomes within facilities. RESULTS Between 2011 and 2018, 55 hospitals met criteria for reporting 027 results, including a total of 5,091 HCFA-CDI cases, with 1,017 infections (20.0%) due to 027 strains. Across these facilities, the use of fluoroquinolones decreased by 52% from 2011 to 2018, with concurrent reductions in the overall HCFA-CDI rate and the proportion of HCFA-CDI cases due to the 027 strain of 13% and 55%, respectively. A multilevel logistic model demonstrated a significant effect of facility-level fluoroquinolone use on the proportion of infections in the facility due to the 027 strain, most noticeably in low-complexity facilities.

A viable alternative in the telemedicine field to guarantee patient nutritional care is telenutrition. Telenutrition involves the interactive use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to implement the nutrition care process with patients at a remote location. Information regarding the experience with this methodology and its potential effect on patients' nutritional goals, does not exist in Peru. The aim of the study was to report the effect of the evaluation type (telenutrition vs. in-person) on anthropometric parameters weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and relative fat mass (RFM) in overweight and obese adult patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 100 eligible patients in a single nutritional center, from January 2019 to March 2021. Results: There was a significant difference in weight, BMI, WC and RFM at the end of the three-month follow-up period, in both evaluation modalities. Patients on the telenutrition group had a mean decrease of 6.80  4.87 cm in their WC, whereas the mean difference observed for the in-person group was 6.74  4.55 cm. There were no statistically significant differences in the changes of any anthropometric parameters when comparing both systems. Reductions were observed in weight (5.93  3.88 kg vs. 4.92  3.29 kg), BMI (2.23  1.39 kg/ m2 vs. 1.83  1.23 kg/ m2), WC (6.80  4.87 cm vs. 6.74  4.55 cm) and RFM (2.43  1.78 vs. 2.63  1.73) in telenutrition and in-person evaluation, respectively. Conclusions: Telenutrition may be regarded as an alternative to in-person evaluation offering anthropometric changes and nutritional goals similar to those reported through the in-person modality, in overweight and obese adult people.","output":"The effects of telenutrition in overweight and obese adults in a nutritional center in Lima, Peru."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a survey dataset describing families conditions during the COVID-19 isolation period obtained from individuals who serve as parents.

The Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (GEAR) Network was organized to identify and prioritize delirium clinical questions. METHODS GEAR identified and engaged 49 transdisciplinary stakeholders including emergency physicians, geriatricians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and patient advocates. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews, clinical questions were derived, medical librarian electronic searches conducted, and applicable research evidence synthesized for ED delirium detection, prevention, and management. The scoping review served as the foundation for a consensus conference to identify the highest priority research foci. RESULTS In the scoping review, 27 delirium detection \\"instruments\\" were described in 48 ED studies and used variable criterion standards with the result of delirium prevalence ranging from 6% to 38%. Clinician gestalt was the most common \\"instrument\\" evaluated with sensitivity ranging from 0% to 81% and specificity from 65% to 100%. For delirium management 15 relevant studies were identified, including one randomized controlled trial. Some intervention studies targeted clinicians via education and others used clinical pathways. Three medications were evaluated to reduce or prevent ED delirium. No intervention consistently prevented or treated delirium. After reviewing the scoping review results, the GEAR stakeholders identified ED delirium prevention interventions not reliant upon additional nurse or physician effort as the highest priority research. CONCLUSIONS Transdisciplinary stakeholders prioritize ED delirium prevention studies that are not reliant upon healthcare worker tasks instead of alternative research directions such as defining etiologic delirium phenotypes to target prevention or intervention strategies.","output":"Delirium Prevention, Detection, and Treatment in Emergency Medicine Settings: A Geriatric Emergency Care Applied Research (GEAR) Network Scoping Review and Consensus Statement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we tried to identify dengue virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell epitopes, which can induce PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) isolated from DF convalescent patients (dengue virus type 1 infection) to secrete IFN-.

We propose a model for testing in a population experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19, and derive an expression for TPP in terms of well-defined parameters related to testing and presence of other pathogens causing COVID-19 like symptoms. In the absence of dramatic shifts of testing practices in time or between locations, the TPP is positively correlated with the incidence of infection. We show that the proportion of tested individuals who present COVID-19 like symptoms encodes similar information to the TPP but has different relationships with the testing parameters, and can thus provide additional information regarding dynamic changes in TPP and incidence. Finally, we compare data on confirmed cases and TPP from US states up to October 2020. We conjecture why states may have higher or lower TPP than average.

In order to monitor ticks and tick-borne pathogens, the Tekenscanner (Dutch for Tick scanner), a citizen science project, was launched in The Netherlands. It is a smartphone application for pet-owners to get ticks from their dog or cat, identified and checked for pathogens for free. At the same time, information about the pet and the geographic location of tick infestation becomes available for research. The application was launched in 2018, and the results of the first 6 months after launch of the app were reported. Ticks were identified based on morphology, and DNA was extracted and amplified by a panel of tick-borne pathogen-specific primers. Next, the amplicons were subjected to reverse line blot with specific probes for important pathogens to determine their presence or absence. The present paper describes the results of 2019 and 2020. There were 2260 ticks collected from 871 dogs and 255 cats (26 ticks were from an unknown host) and all pet owners were informed about the results. Four species of ticks were collected: Ixodes ricinus (90.0%), Ixodes hexagonus (7.3%), Dermacentor reticulatus (2.8%) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.1%). Ixodes ricinus was the tick with the most divergent pathogens: Anaplasma sp. (1.3%), Babesia sp. (0.8%), Borrelia spp. (4.8%), Neoehrlichia sp. (3.7%) and Rickettsia helvetica (12.6%). In I. hexagonus, R. helvetica (1.8%) and Babesia sp. (0.6%) were detected and Rickettsia raoultii in D. reticulatus (16.2%). One of the two nymphs of R. sanguineus was co-infected with Borrelia and R. helvetica and the other one was uninfected. The high numbers of different pathogens found in this study suggest that companion animals, by definition synanthropic animals, and their ticks can serve as sentinels for emerging tick-borne pathogens.

Absenteeism following symptom development and lack of staff trained to obtain samples limit efforts to identify pathogens among infected HCP. METHODS: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial assessed respiratory infection incidence among HCP between 2011 and 2015. Research assistants (RAs) obtained anterior nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from HCP in the workplace following development of respiratory illness symptoms and randomly while asymptomatic. Participants received take-home kits to self-collect swabs when absent from work. Samples mailed to a central laboratory were tested for respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 2,862 participants, 3,467 swabs were obtained from symptomatic participants. Among symptomatic HCP, respiratory virus was detected in 904 of 3,467 (26.1%) samples. Self-collected samples by symptomatic HCP at home had higher rates of viral detection (40.3%) compared to 24% obtained by trained RAs in the workplace (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial, take-home kits were an easily implemented, effective method to self-collect samples by HCP. Other studies have previously shown relative equivalence of self-collected samples to those obtained by trained healthcare workers.

A clinical study was carried out with the participation of 60 patients with CGP (group 1) and 22 patients with cancer of OM (group 2) of the T1-2N0M0 stage, as well as 15 healthy individuals with no revealed periodontal pathology. CGP patients, depending on the depth of periodontal pockets (PC), were divided into two subgroups - with a mild degree (PC depth up to 3.5 mm) and an average degree (PC depth from 4 to 6 mm).

In elderly and immune-compromised patients, an influenza vaccine may be less immunogenic. Hypothesis: A lower post-vaccinal antibody titer (1:16) may be sero-protective against respiratory viral infections in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus24;Rheumatoid Arthritis15;and Sj?grens Syndrome11), who were at least 65 years old or whose relative disease duration (disease duration/age) was greater than 1/8, were examined. Thirty-four of them were vaccinated with a trivalent inactivated non-adjuvant influenza vaccine. The antibody concentration against influenza virus A H1N1 was measured using the standardized hemagglutination inhibition test and patients who got any respiratory viral infection were registered. To test the hypothesis, a correlative analysis was applied, followed by a binary logistic regression that included potential confounding variables, such as age, disease duration and therapy (personal/health-related conditions). Results: Vaccinated patients were significantly less affected by respiratory viral infections (21% vs. 75%). The lower titer considered (1:16) was significantly present more often among vaccinated patients (68% vs. 6%). The correlation between its presence/absence and that of respiratory viral infections was C0.34 (p < 0.05). The binary logistic regression evidenced the relevance of this correlation, confirming the hypothesis. Vaccination was associated with the 87.3% reduction in the likelihood of getting respiratory viral infections, whereas the lower antibody titer (1:16) was associated with the 77.6% reduction in the likelihood of getting respiratory viral infections. The vaccine was well tolerated by all patients and after vaccination no exacerbation of the underlying disease was observed. Conclusions: A lower antibody titer (1:16) against influenza virus A H1N1 could be protective against respiratory viral infections for certain autoimmune rheumatic diseases patients, which confirms the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination.","output":"A Lower Level of Post-Vaccinal Antibody Titer against Influenza Virus A H1N1 May Protect Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases from Respiratory Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 2, 2020, the first Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) case was reported in Jakarta, Indonesia. One and a half months later (15/05/2020), the cumulative number of infection cases was 16,496, with a total of 1076 mortalities. This study investigates the possible role of weather in the early cases of COVID-19 in six selected cities in Indonesia. Daily temperature and relative humidity data from weather stations nearby in each city were collected from March 3 to April 30, 2020, corresponding with COVID-19 incidence. Correlation tests and regression analysis were performed to examine the association of those two data series. Moreover, we analyzed the distribution of COVID-19 referring the weather data to estimate the effective range of weather data supporting the COVID-19 incidence. Our result reveals that weather data is generally associated with COVID-19 incidence. The daily average temperature (T-ave) and relative humidity (RH) present significant positive and negative correlation with COVID-19 data, respectively. However, the correlation coefficients are weak, with the strongest correlations found at the 5-day lag, i.e., 0.37 (? 0.41) for T-ave (RH). The regression analysis consistently confirmed this relation. The distribution analysis reveals that most COVID-19 cases in Indonesia occurred in the daily temperature range of 25C31 C and relative humidity of 74C92%. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 incidence in Indonesia has a weak association with weather conditions. Therefore, non-meteorological factors seem to play a more prominent role and should be given greater consideration in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic has been sweeping all continents, North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and South Asia among others at an alarming rapidity. Here, we provide an estimate of the scale of the pandemic spread under different scenarios of variation in key influencing parameters with a hybrid model. Methods: We developed a new hybrid model of infectious disease transmission based on Cellular Automata (CA)-configured SEIR to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern. A probabilistic contamination network is embedded in the pandemic transmission model to capture the randomness feature of person-to-person spread of the novel virus. We used the improved SEIR model to quantify the population contact state with isolation measures under different continuous time series contact probability via CA. We adjusted the modelling parameters to verify the model performance in accordance to the data from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We simulated several scenarios by varying such key parameters as number of isolation rate, average contact times of the population, number of infected people before taking prevention and control measures, medical level and number of imported cases. Results: In the baseline model, we identified that the isolation control as the most influencing factor that had the largest impact on decreasing the speed of the reproductive number, accelerating the arrival of the \\"inflection point\\" of pandemic prevention and control, and the death rate reduction. We estimated that the probability of people contacts and the number of the onset infected cases before prevention measures also had significant effect on the infection rate reduction with appropriate prevention measures adoption, which partly reflects the impact of timely measure on the severity of the outbreak. We found that imported cases will risk the domestic prevention. Conclusions: Our modelling results clearly indicate that early-stage preventive measures are the most effective way to contain the pandemic spread and a strong interventionist approach needs to be adopted by policymakers vis--vis of the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19. Human resources, intensified isolation and confinement as well as special hospital buildings should be prioritised in countries with large number of infections to constrain the global transmission of the virulent infection. To do so, internationally coordinated actions require to be taken to replicate good practices to less infected countries and regions immediately.","output":"The global COVID-19 pandemic at a crossroads: relevant countermeasures and ways ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Argentinean quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most long-lasting worldwide. We focused on the first 80-days of this quarantine on Argentinean women. Our aims were to analyze differences in general mental health state (MHS) indicators, by the (1) sites of residence with different prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and (2) quarantine duration; (3) to assess multiple relationships between each general MHS indicator and potentially affecting factors. Methods: We used a cross-sectional design with convenience successive sampling (N = 5,013). The online survey included a socio-demographic questionnaire (elaborated ad hoc) with standardized and validated self-reported questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) measuring the MHS indicators: self-perceived health, psychological discomfort, social functioning and coping, and psychological distress. Results: Worse self-perceived health and higher psychological discomfort affected significantly more women residing in sites with high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, compared to those residing in sites with intermediate prevalence, but effect sizes were small. Mean scores of all general MHS indicators were significantly worse for longer quarantine sub-periods (up to 53, 68, and 80-day duration) than for shorter sub-periods (up to seven, 13, and 25-day duration). Being a younger age, having mental disorder history, and longer quarantine durations were associated to worsening MHS, while the lack of previous suicide attempt has a protective effect. Discussion: Our findings show that a worse MHS during quarantine may not be attributed to the objective risk of contagion (measured greater or less), and under quarantine, women MHSas indicated by group central tendency measuresgot worse as time went by. This strongly suggests that special attention needs to be paid to younger women and to women with history of mental disorder. Along with physical health, mental health must be a priority for the Government during and after quarantine and the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"General Mental Health State Indicators in Argentinean Women During Quarantine of up to 80-Day Duration for COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: COVID-19 pandemic has created havoc in every sphere of life and medical education is no exception. To overcome crisis of this pandemic, currently, there is an entire shift in teaching in medical colleges from face-to-face classes to online classes. Virtual teaching requires both technical and pedagogical support and the present study was carried out to assess the perception of medical teachers about this change in medical education. Methods: This analytical, observational, online, and cross-sectional study used newly developed questionnaire that was given to teachers of medical colleges of North India during lockdown period. Answers for the items were read on a five-point Likert-type scale and data was analysed using Descriptive statistics and t-test. Results: A total of 131 participants filled the questionnaire. Out of these 70 (53.4%) were females and 61 (46.6%) were males. Many teachers (33.6%) found online tools to be easier to use and (35.1%) participants were of opinion of possessing sufficient knowledge and skills for conducting online classes but 44.3% of participants want to undergo training for this purpose. Majority of educators (67.2%) did not want to take online classes along with face-to-face classes after COVID pandemic time.

This is frequently difficult to realize due to restricted spatial capacities. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possibility of enabling patients to spend the waiting period outside of the waiting room of the ENT outpatient department, in order to reduce the number of patients in the waiting rooms and therefore observe distancing rules. This was realized by the use of a pager system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the timeframe of 12.5 weeks (04.06.2020C31.08.2020), ENT outpatients were issued with pagers. The patients could thus move freely within the hospital and grounds. The pager system was activated 10C15 min before the appointment, to call patients back to the outpatient ENT clinic. questionnaires were used to evaluate the system and examine patients acceptance and satisfaction. RESULTS: The 137 questionnaires analyzed showed satisfaction with the system, not only regarding distancing rules but also with the more comfortable waiting time. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a pager system for patients could help to meet hygiene and distance rules, and also increase comfort during (often unavoidable) waiting times for patients in the university hospital ENT outpatient department.

Therefore, we examined the characteristics of hantavirus infection on human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs). Receptor expression and infection with pathogenic Puumala virus (PUUV) and low-pathogenic Tula virus (TULV) were explored. To analyze changes in protein expression in infected mesangial cells, we performed a proteome profiler assay analyzing 38 markers of kidney damage. We compared the proteome profile of in vitro-infected HRMCs with the profile detected in urine samples of 11 patients with acute hantavirus infection. We observed effective productive infection of HRMCs with pathogenic PUUV, but only poor abortive infection for low-pathogenic TULV. PUUV infection resulted in the deregulation of proteases, adhesion proteins, and cytokines associated with renal damage. The urinary proteome profile of hantavirus patients demonstrated also massive changes, which in part correspond to the alterations observed in the in vitro infection of HRMCs.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study among stem cell donors registered with DKMS in Germany. Genetic information was linked to self-reported COVID-19 outcome data. Multivariable regression models were fitted to determine the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, severe respiratory tract infection (RTI) and respiratory hospitalization. RESULTS: CCR5 information was available for 110 544 donors who were tested at least once for SARS-CoV-2; 5536 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. For 4758 donors, the COVID-19 disease course was fully evaluable; 498 reported no symptoms, 1227 described symptoms of severe respiratory tract infection, of whom 164 required respiratory hospitalization.

The Omicron variant is a recently emerged variant of concern and is now taking over the Delta variant. To characterize the potential antigenicity of the Omicron variant, we examined the distributions of SARS-CoV-2 nonself mutations (in reference to the human proteome) as 5 amino acid stretches of short constituent sequences (SCSs) in the Omicron and Delta proteomes. The number of nonself SCSs did not differ much throughout the Omicron, Delta, and Reference Sequence (RefSeq) proteomes but markedly increased in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Omicron spike protein compared to those of the Delta and RefSeq proteins. In contrast, the number of nonself SCSs decreased in non-RBD regions in the Omicron spike protein, compensating for the increase in the RBD. Several nonself SCSs were tandemly present in the RBD of the Omicron spike protein, likely as a result of selection for higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor (and hence higher infectivity and transmissibility) at the expense of increased antigenicity. Taken together, the present results suggest that the Omicron variant has evolved to have higher antigenicity and less virulence in humans despite increased infectivity and transmissibility.","output":"Nonself Mutations in the Spike Protein Suggest an Increase in the Antigenicity and a Decrease in the Virulence of the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the Industry 4.0 revolution to upgrade the Internet of Things (IoT) standards provides the prominence outcomes for the future wireless communication systems called 5G.

Still, its safety and efficacy as a respiratory support method for patients with hypoxemic ARF hasn't been studied so well. AIM The aim of our study was to examine the safety and efficacy of NIV in hypoxemic ARF of primary lung origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients with hypoxemic ARF due to communityacquired pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated using NIV. They were divided into four groups: pneumonia without ARDS, mild, moderate, or severe ARDS. Their clinical and ABG parameters were recorded before initiation of NIV, at 1 hour and 24 hours after ventilation onset and at transition to non-intensive NIV or before endotracheal intubation in NIV failure cases. RESULTS A total of 63 patients were included. NIV trial was successful in 85.71% of them, while 14.29% experienced NIV failure. In the general population, we observed a significant difference in PaO2/FiO2 only before transition to non-intensive NIV in comparison to the value at admission. This trend was seen in the patients with pneumonia without ARDS and moderate ARDS, but not in those with mild and severe ARDS. The clinical parameters showed improvement early in the course of treatment both in the entire study population and all subgroups.

The corresponding field distributions in simulation corroborated our assumption and its sensitivity could be up to 1049 nm/RIU. Then, we fabricated the sample by e-beam lithography process for a seed layer and simply tilting the sample during deposition to obtain oblique flat sheets. When considering the stochastic nature of the deposited multiple oblique flat sheets, we modified the metallic upper resonator of the MPA from the single oblique-flat-sheet into randomly distributed oblique-wire-bundle (OWB) and in simulation, its sensitivity is boosted up to 3319 nm/RIU. In experiments, the measured sensitivity is 1329 nm/RIU under different concentrations of glucose solutions that is four times larger than the 330 nm/RIU of the planar MPA. The higher sensitivity was attributed to that the OWB MPA could provide hot spots within air not only between OWB and grounded metal but also among wires.

METHODS: The mixed methods design included a subset of cancer patients who responded to a cross-sectional survey in May 2020. Data were collected through telephone interviews. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT), and Connor-Davidson-Resilience Scale (CD-RISC2) were used to measure distress and resilience. Data were analysed by thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Forty patients with lung, breast, colorectal and skin (melanoma) cancer were included; 65% were women. Mean age was 62.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 13.2). Most patients had curable disease (65%); 50% were in treatment and 50% in post-treatment follow up. The interviews revealed four themes: 1) the cost of living with cancer during COVID-19, 2) changes in cancer care delivery, 3) particularly vulnerable, and 4) importance of family support. Mean NCCN DT score was 2.3 (SD, 2.6) while the mean CD-RISC2 score was 7.25 (SD, 1.1). CONCLUSION: Despite drastic changes in daily life imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, Danish cancer patients had remarkably low levels of distress and high levels of resilience.

Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. METHODS: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. RESULTS: The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of <3 C and became flat above 3 C. When mean temperature (lag0C14) was below 3 C, each 1 C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209C6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3 C.

With incomplete reperfusion, the union of baseline DWI and posttreatment PWI is hypothesized to predict infarct volume. METHODS This is a substudy of Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study 2 (DEFUSE 2); all patients with technically adequate MRI scans at 3 time points were included. Baseline DWI and early follow-up PWI lesion volumes were determined by the RAPID software program. Final infarct volumes were assessed with 5-day fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and were corrected for edema. Reperfusion was defined on the basis of the reduction in PWI lesion volume between baseline and early follow-up MRI. DWI and PWI volumes were correlated with final infarct volumes. RESULTS Seventy-three patients were eligible. Twenty-six patients with >90% reperfusion show a high correlation between early DWI volume and final infarct volume (r=0.95; P<0.001). Nine patients with <10% reperfusion have a high correlation between baseline PWI (Tmax >6 seconds) volume and final infarct volume (r=0.86; P=0.002). Using all 73 patients, the union of baseline DWI and early follow-up PWI is highly correlated with final infarct volume (r=0.94; P<0.001). The median absolute difference between observed and predicted final volumes is 15 mL (interquartile range, 5.5-30.2).

Considering the uncertainty of investment in nuclear power generation, the authors propose the MGT (Monte-Carlo and Gaussian Radial Basis with Tensor factorization) utility evaluation model to evaluate the risk of investment in nuclear power in Kazakhstan and provide a relevant reference for decision making on inland nuclear investment in Kazakhstan. Design/methodology/approach: Based on real options portfolio combined with a weighted utility function, this study takes into account the uncertainties associated with nuclear power investments through a minimum variance Monte Carlo approach, proposes a noise-enhancing process combined with geometric Brownian motion in solving complex conditions, and incorporates a measure of investment flexibility and strategic value in the investment, and then uses a deep noise reduction encoder to learn the initial values for potential features of cost and investment effectiveness. A Gaussian radial basis function used to construct a weighted utility function for each uncertainty, generate a minimization of the objective function for the tensor decomposition, and then optimize the objective loss function for the tensor decomposition, find the corresponding weights, and perform noise reduction to generalize the nonlinear problem to evaluate the effectiveness of nuclear power investment. Finally, the two dimensions of cost and risk (estimation of investment value and measurement of investment risk) are applied and simulated through actual data in Kazakhstan. Findings: The authors assess the core indicators of Kazakhstan's nuclear power plants throughout their construction and operating cycles, based on data relating to a cluster of nuclear power plants of 10 different technologies. The authors compared it with several popular methods for evaluating the benefits of nuclear power generation and conducted subsequent sensitivity analyses of key indicators. Experimental results on the dataset show that the MGT method outperforms the other four methods and that changes in nuclear investment returns are more sensitive to changes in costs while operating cash flows from nuclear power are certainly an effective way to drive investment reform in inland nuclear power generation in Kazakhstan at current levels of investment costs. Research limitations/implications: Future research could consider exploring other excellent methods to improve the accuracy of the investment prediction further using sparseness and noise interference. Also consider collecting some expert advice and providing more appropriate specific suggestions, which will facilitate the application in practice. Practical implications: The Novel Coronavirus epidemic has plunged the global economy into a deep recession, the tension between China and the US has made the energy cooperation road unusually tortuous, Kazakhstan in Central Asia has natural geographical and resource advantages, so ChinaCKazakhstan energy cooperation as a new era of opportunity, providing a strong guarantee for China's political and economic stability.

Chronic age-related diseases in an increasing number of people represent an enormous burden for health and social care. The immune system deteriorates during ageing and contributes to many of these age-associated diseases due to its pivotal role in pathogen clearance, tissue homeostasis and maintenance. Moreover, in order to develop treatments for COVID-19, we urgently need to acquire more knowledge about the aged immune system, as older adults are disproportionally and more severely affected. Changes with age lead to impaired responses to infections, malignancies and vaccination, and are accompanied by chronic, low-degree inflammation, which together is termed immunosenescence. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie immunosenescence, termed immune cell senescence, are mostly unknown. Cellular senescence, characterised by an irreversible cell cycle arrest, is thought to be the cause of tissue and organismal ageing. Thus, better understanding of cellular senescence in immune populations at single-cell level may provide us with insight into how immune cell senescence develops over the life time of an individual. In this review, we will briefly introduce the phenotypic characterisation of aged innate and adaptive immune cells, which also contributes to overall immunosenescence, including subsets and function. Next, we will focus on the different hallmarks of cellular senescence and cellular ageing, and the detection techniques most suitable for immune cells.

SSDs seek to improve upon probabilistic extrapolation of laboratory (and sometimes field) collected ecotoxicity data for environmental protection by modeling the diversity of multiple experimental results in the form of a single statistical distribution which reduces or eliminates the need for extrapolation with deterministic assessment factors. SSDs thus depend heavily on both statistical and biological knowledge. In this commentary we review recently published literature identifying areas of improvement based on fundamental statistical theory or application in environmental assessment contexts. We reveal that sound application of SSDs relies heavily upon a grasp of probability distributions, how asymmetric confidence intervals are derived for distributions common to SSDs, the influence of sample size on parameter estimation, and how these are collectively applied across the myriad of regulatory systems globally.

We applied snow management strategies integrated in the snowpack simulations of AMUNDSEN, Crocus, and SNOWPACKCAlpine3D for nine PROSNOW ski resorts located in the European Alps. We assessed the performance of the snow simulations for five winter seasons (2015C2020) using both ground-based data (GNSS-measured snow depth) and spaceborne snow maps (Copernicus Sentinel-2). Particular attention has been devoted to characterizing the spatial performance of the simulated piste snow management at a resolution of 10 m. The simulated results showed a high overall accuracy of more than 80 % for snow-covered areas compared to the Sentinel-2 data. Moreover, the correlation to the ground observation data was high. Potential sources for local differences in the snow depth between the simulations and the measurements are mainly the impact of snow redistribution by skiers;compensation of uneven terrain when grooming;or spontaneous local adaptions of the snow management, which were not reflected in the simulations. Subdividing each individual ski resort into differently sized ski resort reference units (SRUs) based on topography showed a slight decrease in mean deviation.

The rapid spread of the disease and enforcement of public health measures has caused distress among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women. With a limited understanding of the novel, emerging infectious disease, pregnant women have sought ways to access timely and trusted health care information. The mental health status of pregnant women during this public health emergency, as well as how they responded to the situation and where and how they obtained antenatal care information, remain to be understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic in China by measuring their perceived stress, anxiety, and depression levels; explore the approaches used by them to access antenatal health care information; and determine their associations with maternal mental health status. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey to assess the mental health status of Chinese pregnant women by using the validated, Chinese version of Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Edinburgh Depression Scale. We also collected information on the various approaches these women used to access antenatal care information during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, from February 5 to 28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1873 pregnant women from 22 provinces or regions of China participated in the survey. The prevalence of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression among these participants was 89.1% (1668/1873; 95% CI 87.6%, 90.4%), 18.1% (339/1873; 95% CI 16.4%, 19.9%), and 45.9% (859/1873; 95% CI 43.6%, 48.1%), respectively. Hospitals official accounts on the Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo were the most popular channels among these pregnant women to obtain antenatal care information during the COVID-19 outbreak. Access to antenatal care information via the hospitals official social media accounts was found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of perceived stress (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.30-0.72; P=.001), anxiety (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.68; P<.001), and depression (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.91; P=.005). Access to health care information via hospital hotlines or SMS was found to be significantly associated with a lower risk of anxiety only (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, pregnant women experienced high levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. During such public health emergencies, mental health care services should be strengthened to reassure and support pregnant women. Specific information targeted at pregnant women, including information on how to cope in an emergency or major disease outbreak, developed and disseminated by health care institutions via social media platforms could be an effective way to mitigate mental health challenges and ensure epidemic preparedness and response in the future.","output":"Maternal Mental Health Status and Approaches for Accessing Antenatal Care Information During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Ethics Committees (RECs)-or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), as they are known in the US-were created about 50 years ago to independently assess the ethical acceptability of research projects involving human subjects, their fundamental role being the protection of the dignity and rights of research participants.

Accumulated evidence suggests that many phyto-compounds possess anti-viral activity. Therefore, we identified possible phyto-compounds that could be developed and used for COVID-19 treatment. In particular, molecular docking was used to prioritize the possible active phyto-compounds against two key targets namely RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, an antiviral drug- Remdesivir (RdRp inhibitor) and Darunavir (M(pro) inhibitor) are used as reference drugs. This study revealed that phyto-molecules- Mulberroside-A/C/E/F, Emblicanin A, Nimbolide, and Punigluconin showed high binding affinity against RdRp while Andrographolides, Mulberrosides, Anolignans, Chebulic acid, Mimusopic acid, and Punigluconin showed better binding affinity against M(pro) as compared with the reference drug. Furthermore, ADME profiles validated the drug-likeness properties of prioritized phyto-compounds. Besides, to assess the stability, MD simulations studies were performed along with reference inhibitors for M(pro) (Darunavir) and RdRp (Remdesivir). Binding free energy calculations (MM-PBSA) revealed the estimated value (G) of M(pro)_Darunavir; M(pro)_Mulberroside E; RdRp_Remdesivir and RdRp_Emblicanin A were ?111.62  6.788, ?141.443  9.313, 30.782  5.85 and ?89.424  3.130 kJmol(?1), respectively.

A specific type of interaction is that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service provider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby. Consider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing has been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users wish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual. However, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location history with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed several protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users upload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location predicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is reported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a predicate such as\\"10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the infected patient in the last week\\"), and the corresponding users notified. However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is substantial.","output":"An Efficient and Secure Location-based Alert Protocol using Searchable Encryption and Huffman Codes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the professional identities and the willingness of nurses to respond to the call for support during the COVID\\\\19 epidemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 epidemic has resulted in nearly 300 million cases worldwide, causing more than five million deaths. However, the professional identities and the willingness of nurses to provide support during the COVID\\\\19 epidemic in China remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 1,505 eligible nurses from 120 hospitals during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak in China were included. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the willingness of these nurses to participate in epidemic control efforts. The Nurses' Professional Identity Scale was used to measure their sense of professional identity. RESULTS: About 90% of the nurses were willing to lend support in Hubei Province during the epidemic. The most common reason (93.84%) was found to be their beliefs as medical personnel in helping others in need. Nearly 10% of the nurses were unwilling to go to Hubei, primarily due to family reasons. The average total score of the Professional Identity Scale for all nurses reached a moderate to high level as indication of professional identity (116C125). Nurses who were willing to go to Hubei had a significantly higher total score than those who were not.

We tested the hypothesis that adjusting tidal volume (VT) to a non-injurious SI in an open lung condition avoids hypoventilation while preventing overdistension in an experimental model of combined lung injury and low chest-wall compliance (Ccw). METHODS Lung injury was induced by repeated lung lavages using warm saline solution, and Ccw was reduced by controlled intra-abdominal air-insufflation in 22 anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated pigs. After injury animals were recruited and submitted to a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration trial to find the PEEP level resulting in maximum compliance. During a subsequent four hours of mechanical ventilation, VT was adjusted to keep a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 30 cmH2O (Pplat-group, n = 11) or to a SI between 0.95 and 1.05 (SI-group, n = 11). Respiratory rate was adjusted to maintain a 'normal' PaCO2 (35 to 65 mmHg). SI, lung mechanics, arterial-blood gases haemodynamics pro-inflammatory cytokines and histopathology were analyzed. In addition Computed Tomography (CT) data were acquired at end expiration and end inspiration in six animals. RESULTS PaCO2 was significantly higher in the Pplat-group (82 versus 53 mmHg, P = 0.01), with a resulting lower pH (7.19 versus 7.34, P = 0.01). We observed significant differences in VT (7.3 versus 5.4 mlKg(-1), P = 0.002) and Pplat values (30 versus 35 cmH2O, P = 0.001) between the Pplat-group and SI-group respectively. SI (1.03 versus 0.99, P = 0.42) and end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure (PTP) (17 versus 18 cmH2O, P = 0.42) were similar in the Pplat- and SI-groups respectively, without differences in overinflated lung areas at end- inspiration in both groups. Cytokines and histopathology showed no differences. CONCLUSIONS Setting tidal volume to a non-injurious stress index in an open lung condition improves alveolar ventilation and prevents overdistension without increasing lung injury. This is in comparison with limited Pplat protective ventilation in a model of lung injury with low chest-wall compliance.","output":"Adjusting tidal volume to stress index in an open lung condition optimizes ventilation and prevents overdistension in an experimental model of lung injury and reduced chest wall compliance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile health devices are emerging applications that could help deliver point-of-care (POC) diagnosis, particularly in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure, such as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of IP and to determine its clinical, biological, and evolutive characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a five year, five months retrospective study from July 2006 to December 2011. All patients on peritoneal dialysis that have been followed on PD for a minimum of 3 months and who presented IP during follow-up were included. Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS The 76 episodes of IP were identified in 36 patients. The peritonitis rate (months  patients/peritonitis), as calculated by the Registre de Dialyse Pritonale de Langue Fran?aise (RDPLF Registry) [French peritoneal dialysis registry] in December 2011, was 18.59. Time to occurrence of peritonitis from the start of peritoneal exchange was 15.4410 months. The mean age of our patients was 49.116.8 years [10-80]: the youngest patient's age was 10, while the oldest was 80 years old (male to female: sex ratio M/F=1,66). Also, 22% of our patients were diabetic. The mean follow-up in PD was 22.614 months. Abdominal pain was present in 79% of the cases. Fever and vomiting were noted in 42% and 38% of cases, respectively. The C-reactive protein rate was elevated in 77% of cases, and leukocytosis was found in 27% of cases. Bacteriological proof was present in 73.68% of cases. Gram-positive cocci were involved in 56.6% of microbiologically proven IP cases. Gram-negative bacilli were represented in 37.7%. The outcome was favorable in 89.4%. The PD catheter was removed in 2.63% of the cases. In addition, 7.89% of our patients were transferred to hemodialysis. DISCUSSION The rate of IP remains high in our series. More than one-half of the peritonitis cases with positive cultures (56.6%) were caused by Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacilli ranked second (27.7%). These results agree with data in the literature. Moreover, the rate of culture-negative IP in our series is high (26%). Evolution is good in most cases (89%). CONCLUSION Despite the gradual decrease of its rate, peritonitis remains frequent in our center and calls for optimization of means of prevention. The high frequency of negative culture IP in our study urges us toward better collaboration with biologists to target antibiotic therapy and improve IP management.","output":"Infectious peritonitis profile in peritoneal dialysis at Ibn Sina University Hospital: a 6-year data report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) do not initially demonstrate severe features requiring hospitalization.

Outcomes were collected through April 14, 2020, with a minimum of 12 day follow-up and included subsequent ED visit, admission status, and mortality. Results: Of the 821 patients, mean age was 49.3 years (SD 15.7), 46.8% were male and 55.1% were African-American. Cough was the most frequent symptom in 78.2% of patients with a median duration of 3 days (IQR 2-7), and other symptoms included fever 62.1%, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion 35.1% and dyspnea 31.2%. ACEI/ARBs usage was reported in 28.7% patients and 34.0% had diabetes mellitus. Return to the ED for re-evaluation was reported in 19.2% of patients from whom 54.4% were admitted.

However, its efficacy is debated and toxicity concerns might limit the therapeutic range of this drug. Computational models that aid in balancing efficacy and toxicity would be of great help. Parametrizing models is difficult because the prodrug remdesivir is metabolized to its active form (RDV-TP) upon cell entry, which complicates doseCactivity relationships. Here, we employ a computational model that allows drug efficacy predictions based on the binding affinity of RDV-TP for its target polymerase in SARS-CoV-2. We identify an optimal infusion rate to maximize remdesivir efficacy. We also assess drug efficacy in suppressing both wild-type and resistant strains, and thereby describe a drug regimen that may select for resistance. Our results differ from predictions using prodrug doseCresponse curves (pseudo-EC [Formula: see text] s). We expect that reaching 90% inhibition (EC [Formula: see text]) is insufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs. While standard dosing mildly inhibits viral polymerase and therefore likely reduces morbidity, we also expect selection for resistant mutants for most realistic parameter ranges. To increase efficacy and safeguard against resistance, we recommend more clinical trials with dosing regimens that substantially increase the levels of RDV-TP and/or pair remdesivir with companion antivirals.","output":"Mathematical Modeling of Remdesivir to Treat COVID-19: Can Dosing Be Optimized?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections and mental disorders are two of the major global disease burdens.

METHODS AND DESIGN: Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services Nursing Home COVID-19 data were linked with other NH- or community-level data (eg, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, Minimum Data Set, Nursing Home Compare, and the American Community Survey). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: NHs with more than 30 occupied beds (N=13,123) with weekly reported NH COVID-19 records between the weeks of June 7, 2020, and August 23, 2020. Measurements and model: Weekly indicators of any new COVID-19 cases and any new deaths (outcome variables) were regressed on the percentage of black and Hispanic residents in an NH, stratified by the percentage of blacks and Hispanics in the community in which the NH was located. A set of linear probability models with NH random effects and robust standard errors were estimated, accounting for other covariates. RESULTS: The racial and ethnic composition of NHs and their communities were both associated with the likelihood of having COVID-19 cases and death in NHs. The racial and ethnic composition of the community played an independent role in the likelihood of COVID-19 cases and death in NHs, even after accounting for the COVID-19 infection rate in the community (ie, daily cases per 1000 people in the county). Moreover, the racial and ethnic composition of a community modified the relationship between NH characteristics (eg, staffing) and the likelihoods of COVID-19 cases and death.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who provided care to patients with complex and/or chronic problems. They feared a deterioration in quality of care and a decline in their job satisfaction. Nurses were also critical, especially those who provided FACT and outreaching care. Their patients often lacked the resources or skills required to access digital care. CONCLUSION: This assessment of remote care was likely adversely affected by the corona measures. Employees were suddenly forced to alter their usual work habits and had not been optimally trained in the new method were more critical. Moreover, they were forced to work from home and lacked informal professional contact with colleagues. Nevertheless, professionals have a nuanced and predominantly positive opinion of video calling: it is not suitable for everyone or appropriate under all circumstances, but remote care is seen as a useful addition to the existing arsenal of treatment modalities.","output":"[Mental health care in times of corona: experiences of professionals with eHealth]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hibiscus schizopetalus (Dyer) Hook.f. (Malvaceae) is an ornamental plant. The aim was to investigate its antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. In vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities of the 70% ethanolic extract (Et-E) of the aerial parts of the plant were determined. The Dichloromethane Fraction (DCM-F) and the n-Butanol Fraction (Bu-F) were assessed using Liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry (LC-MS). The DCM-F showed higher antiviral activities against Coxsackie B4 (CoxB4) viruses (IC(50) = 64.13 g/mL) and adenoviruses (IC(50) = 54.88 g/mL) than acyclovir (IC(50) = 72.79 g/mL for CoxB4 viruses; IC(50) = 91.92 g/mL for adenoviruses). The DCM-F showed higher anti-helicobacter pylori activity (MIC = 3.9 g/mL) than clarithromycin (MIC = 1.95 g/mL). The DCM-F inhibited Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Type I (IC(50) = 29.85 g/mL) and HSV Type II (IC(50) = 74.17 g/mL). The Bu-F showed higher anti-mycobacterial activity (MIC = 7.81 g/mL) than isoniazid (MIC = 0.24 g/mL) and higher antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)(MIC = 7.81 g/mL) than vancomycin (MIC = 3.9 g/mL). Antioxidant assays included total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), and iron reducing power. The Bu-F showed the highest antioxidant activity. Chemical profiles were analyzed using HPLC-HRCESICMS to identify the metabolites responsible for these biological activities. We identified more than 60 metabolites that belong to anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolics, terpenes, sterols, and fatty acids. In conclusion, Hibiscus schizopetalus is endowed with metabolites that could be used against viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The model was used for identification of optimal doses that would result in at least 90% of patients achieving serum drug concentrations that result in 90% of maximum drug effect (IC90) for at least 28 days. The serum IC90 (95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 4.2 (3.2C4.3) g/mL for bamlanivimab and 12.6 (9.7C12.8) g/mL for etesevimab. Observed clinical trial data confirmed PK and PK/PD model predictions that doses of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1,400 mg etesevimab would result in maximum reduction in viral load, with no additional effect seen at higher doses. No dose adjustment is recommended as age, sex, race, baseline viral load, and hepatic impairment did not have a significant impact on the PK of the antibodies.

Missed cancer is defined as having had a negative upper GI endoscopy within three years of confirmatory diagnosis. The aims of this study are to quantify cases of missed upper GI cancer at endoscopy from a district general hospital and identify potential predisposing factors to improve future outcomes. Methods In this project, retrospective patient records were obtained from MDT meetings run between 2019 and 2020. For data comparison, similar records from previous cohorts were reviewed. The endoscopy records of these patients were extracted from the CIPTS endoscopy recording system and analysed to see if any patient had an endoscopy within the three years prior to diagnosis of their upper GI cancer. Previous endoscopies were scrutinised for the following factors: indication, visible abnormality, biopsy, endoscopist grade, sedation, presentation type, histology and follow up. Results Of the 280 patients in total, 20 (7.1%) had a negative endoscopy in three years prior to diagnosis. Subgroup analysis of 2019-20 patients showed identified 78 cases of upper GI cancer. We identified five formal cases of missed upper GI cancer in this subgroup. In the 2019-20 cohort the average age in the missed cancer group and non-missed cancer group were 83.8 and 73.2 years, respectively. Factors identified in missed cancer groups from earlier cohorts included emergency bleeding, visible abnormality not biopsied, administrative delay in rescope and lack of recognition of pathology. Conclusions The incidence of missed upper GI cancer diagnosis within this centre is similar to that of recent studies from other centres. Our study has highlighted that advanced age, accurate recognition and biopsy, and timely re-biopsy may be factors influencing missed upper GI cancers. This evidence has highlighted the importance of endoscopy training in the recognition and biopsy of pre neoplastic lesions. Furthermore, we intend to analyse data for the year 2020-21 to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on missed upper GI cancer diagnosis.","output":"Missed upper gastrointestinal cancers: Predisposing factors in a district general hospital population over 7 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various agents are currently under evaluation as potential treatments in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Plasma from patients that have overcome COVID-19 infection, referred to as convalescent plasma, is a treatment option with considerable background in viral diseases such as Spanish influenza, H1N1, Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Although convalescent plasma has historically proven beneficial in the treatment of some viral diseases, its use is still explorative in the context of COVID-19 To date, preliminary evidence from case series is favorable as significant clinical, biochemical improvement and hospital discharge have been reported A detailed overview of randomized as well non-randomized trials of treatment with convalescent plasma, which have been registered worldwide, is provided in this review Based on these studies, data from thousands of patients is anticipated in the near future Convalescent plasma seems to be a safe option, but potential risks such as transfusion-related acute lung injury and antibody-dependent enhancement are discussed Authorities including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and scientific associations such as the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) and the European Blood Alliance (EBA), have provided guidance into the selection criteria for donors and recipients A debatable, pivotal issue pertains to the optimal timing of convalescent plasma transfusion This treatment should be administered as early as possible to maximize efficacy, but at the same time be reserved for severe cases Emerging risk stratification algorithms integrating clinical and biochemical markers to trace the cases at risk of significant deterioration can prove valuable in this direction","output":"The Emerging Role of Convalescent Plasma in the Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reports a longitudinal study exploring talent management, through narratives provided by a group of managers of doctoral programmes in eight UK universities during the 2020 coronavirus outbreak.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a unique visceral fat, presents with high degree of inflammation in severe COVID-19 disease. Whether and how adipose tissue may respond to the COVID-19 therapies is unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the difference in computed tomography (CT) measured EAT and subcutaneous (SAT) attenuation, defined as mean attenuation expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), in 72 patients [meanSD age was 59.612.4 years, 50 (69%) were men] at the hospital admission for COVID-19 and 99 days [IQR (71-129)] after discharge. RESULTS: At the admission, EAT HU was significantly correlated with blood glucose levels, interleukin 6 , troponin T levels and waist circumference. EAT HU decreased from -87.2116.18 to -100.011 (p<0.001) whereas SAT HU did not change (-110.2112.1 to -111.1127.82, p=0.78) after therapy.

During the pandemic, large amounts of COVID-19-related tweets emerge every day. Real-time processing of daily tweets may offer insights for monitoring public opinion about intervention measures implemented. In this work, lockdown policy in New York State has been set as a target of public opinion research. This task includes two stages, stance detection and opinion monitoring. For the stance detection stage, we explored several combinations of different text representations and classification algorithms, finding that the combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) outperforms others. Due to the shortage of labeled data, we adopted the data distillation method for the training data augmentation. The augmentation of the training data allows to improve the performance of the model with a very small amount of manually-labeled data. After applying the distillation method, the accuracy of the model has been significantly improved. Utilizing the enhanced model, automatically classified tweets are analyzed over time to monitor the public opinion. By exploring the tweets in New York from January 22nd until September 30th, 2020, we show the correlation of public opinion with COVID-19 cases and mortality data, and the effect of government responses on the opinion shift.

Results from correlations and multiple regression substantiated the findings of many previous studies, however, it was found that, when controlling for shared variance among predictors via relative weights analysis, COVID-19 knowledge, trust in science, age, and Trump approval were the strongest predictors of preventative behaviors. Alternatively, trust in science, gender, age, and conservatism were the strongest predictors of vaccine intentions.

METHODS: The study was conducted in consented postnatal women, who self-administered medications from their bedside lockers. The mode of delivery and parity were recorded. Data were compared in women who self-administered to those who did not. Midwives used our established midwife formulary to write their essential unprescribed medications. Direct interview questionnaires were used to obtain their knowledge on chosen post-delivery medicines, pain satisfaction, the Green Bag Scheme and factors contributing to constipation. Regular medicines counts were used to check adherence. Midwives' time not administering these self-administered medications was estimated. Self-reported questionnaires were used to obtain feedback from participants and midwives. Responses were analysed proportionately and where appropriate by simple statistics. RESULTS: Women (n=203) who self-administered were compared with those (n=401) who did not. Greater medicines' knowledge and better (96% vs 79%) pain satisfaction were found in self-administering women. Knowledge of each contributing factor to constipation varied. Mode of delivery and parity had no impact on these outcomes. Adherence seemed high 96% (195/203). Awareness of the Green Bag Scheme was poor (66/604).

Participants: (a) Twin volunteers: 1089 healthy adults enrolled in Twins-UK, mean age 59 (17); tympanic temperature measurements; (b) Community-based: 3972 adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application, age 43 (13); self-reported test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; self-reported temperature measurements; (c) Hospitalised: cohorts of 520 and 757 adult patients with emergency admission to two teaching hospitals between 01/03/2020C04/05/2020, age 62 (17) and 68 (17) respectively; RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. ANALYSIS: (a) heritability analysed using saturated and ACE univariate models; linear mixed-effect model for associations between basal temperature and age, sex and BMI. (b&c) multivariable linear regression for associations between temperature and age, sex and BMI; multivariable logistic regression for associations between fever(>/= 37.8C) and age, sex and BMI. RESULTS: Basal temperature in twins demonstrated 50% heritability (95%CI[42C57%]). In healthy twin, community-based and hospitalised cohorts, increasing age is associated with lower temperatures, and increasing BMI with higher temperatures: (a) Twins (age:p < 0.001; BMI:p = 0.002); (b) Community-based (age: p < 0.001; BMI: p < 0.001); (c) Hospitalised (1st hospital: age: p = 0.106; BMI: p = 0.033; 2nd hospital: age: p < 0.001; BMI: p = 0.010). Increasing age was negatively and BMI positively associated with fever (1st hospital: Age: OR = 0.99, p = 0.033; BMI: OR = 1.00, p = 0.045; 2nd hospital: Age: OR = 0.99, p = 0.010; BMI: OR 1.02, p = 0.038).

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the urgency of enhancing CHIM research capability and the importance of having clear ethical guidance for their conduct. The payment of CHIM participants is a controversial issue involving stakeholders across ethics, medicine and policymaking with allegations circulating suggesting exploitation, coercion and other violations of ethical principles. There are multiple approaches to payment: reimbursement, wage payment and unlimited payment. We introduce a new Payment for Risk Model, which involves paying for time, pain and inconvenience and for risk associated with participation. We give philosophical arguments based on utility, fairness and avoidance of exploitation to support this. We also examine a cross-section of the UK public and CHIM experts. We found that CHIM participants are currently paid variable amounts. A representative sample of the UK public believes CHIM participants should be paid approximately triple the UK minimum wage and should be paid for the risk they endure throughout participation. CHIM experts believe CHIM participants should be paid more than double the UK minimum wage but are divided on the payment for risk. The Payment for Risk Model allows risk and pain to be accounted for in payment and could be used to determine ethically justifiable payment for CHIM participants. Although many research guidelines warn against paying large amounts or paying for risk, our empirical findings provide empirical support to the growing number of ethical arguments challenging this status quo. We close by suggesting two ways (value of statistical life or consistency with risk in other employment) by which payment for risk could be calculated.","output":"Payment in challenge studies: ethics, attitudes and a new payment for risk model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired us, as medical students, to reflect upon the communication training we have received in medical school and the obstacles we have faced in the clinic due to COVID-19.

This analysis shares the outcomes of HIV-ST implementation within the Zimbabwe HIV Care and Treatment (ZHCT) project for the period October 2018CMarch, 2020. Materials and Methods: We extracted HIV-ST data for the period October 2018 to March 2020 from the project database and assessed (1) the proportion of reactive HIV-ST results; (2) the concordance between reactive HIV-ST results against rapid confirmatory HIV tests using Determine? and Chembio? in parallel; and (3) the monthly contribution of HIV-ST to total HIV positive individuals identified within project. The Chi-square test was used to assess for statistical differences in HIV positivity between age groups, by sex and district; as well as the difference in HIV positivity between the HIV-ST and index and mobile testing strategies. Findings: Between October 2018 and March 2020, the ZHCT project distributed 11,983 HIV-ST kits; 11,924 (99.8%) were used and 2,616 (21.9%) were reactive. Of the reactive tests, 2,610 (99.8%) were confirmed HIV positive giving a final positivity rate of 21.9%, and a concordance rate of 99.8% between the HIV-ST results and the confirmatory tests. Proportion of reactive results differed by age-groups (p < 0.001); with the 35C49 years having the highest positivity rate of 25.5%. The contribution of HIV-ST to total new positives increased from 10% in October 2018 to 80% at the end of March 2020 (p < 0.001). Positivity rates from HIV-ST were significantly different by age-groups, sex and district (p = 0.04). Additionally, index and mobile testing had a higher positivity rate compared to HIV-ST (p < 0.001).

By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokineCcytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from the literature and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated the literature information on cellCcytokine interactions from two systems of immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cellCcell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokineCcytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink, we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify cell types and cytokine interactions following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting important cytokine interactions that might contribute to severe illness in a subgroup of patients. Such findings have the potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies.

The severe rate and the prognosis was compared between two groups. The data of peripheral lymphocyte and subsets, age, glucose metabolism parameters were compared between four subgroups, and its relationship to the disease severity, the viral negative conversion time, and the prognosis were analyzed. Results: In this COVID-19 cohort the proportion of DM was 20%. Patients with DM had significantly higher severe rate and worse prognosis than those without DM, the difference was significant (severe rate ,cured, unhealed and death in DM and non-DM groups:61.11%vs.25.00%,26.32%,68.42%;5.26%vs.71.05%,26.32%,2.68%,  2 =2.940, 3.394, P =0.003,0.001,respectively),simultaneously the proportion of DM in severe cases was higher than that in non-severe cases, the obvious difference was found (36.67% vs.12.31%,  2 =2.744, P =0.006).Severe cases with DM tended to have the lowest lymphocytes count levels and percentage values, as well as the lowest T cells count levels and percentage values, helper T cells count levels and percentage values, suppressor T cells count levels, B cells count levels and percentage values compared with those severe cases without DM and non-severe cases with or without DM.

Antibodies persist in the blood after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Since COVID-19 vaccines induce immune response to the Spike protein of the virus, which is the main serosurveillance target to date, alternative targets should be explored to distinguish infection from vaccination. Methods Multiplex immunoassay data from 1,513 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-tested individuals (352 positive and 1,161 negative) with a primary infection and no vaccination history were used to determine the accuracy of Nucleoprotein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in detecting past SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described Spike S1 and Nucleoprotein-specific IgG responses in 230 COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (Pfizer/BioNTech). Results The sensitivity of Nucleoprotein seropositivity was 85% (95% confidence interval: 80-90%) for mild COVID-19 in the first two months following symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower in asymptomatic individuals (67%, 50-81%). Participants who had experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 11 months preceding vaccination, as assessed by Spike S1 seropositivity or RT-qPCR, produced 2.7-fold higher median levels of IgG to Spike S1 []14 days after the first dose as compared to those unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 at []7 days after the second dose (p=0.011). Nucleoprotein-specific IgG concentrations were not affected by vaccination in naive participants.

Rehabilitation interventions could support individuals during the recovery phase of COVID-19, but a comprehensive understanding of this new disease and its associated needs is crucial. This qualitative study investigated the experience of individuals who had been hospitalized for COVID-19, focusing on those needs and difficulties they perceived as most urgent. METHODS: This naturalistic qualitative study was part of a single-center mix-method cross-sectional study (REACT) conducted in Italy during the first peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The qualitative data collection took place through a telephone interview conducted 3 months after hospital discharge. The experience of individuals discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19 was investigated through the main research question C Tell me, how has it been going since you were discharged?. Two secondary questions investigated symptoms, activities, and participation. Data were recorded and transcribed verbatim within 48 h. An empirical phenomenological approach was used by the researchers, who independently analyzed the data and, through consensus, developed an interpretative model to answer the research question. Translation occurred after data was analyzed. RESULTS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, 784 individuals with COVID-19 were discharged from the hospitals of the Local Health Authority of the Province of Reggio Emilia (Italy); 446 were excluded due to the presence of acute or chronic conditions causing disability other than COVID-19 (n. 339), inability to participate in the study procedures (n. 56), insufficient medical documentation to allow for screening (n. 21), discharge to residential facilities (n. 25), and pregnancy (n. 5). Overall, 150 individuals consented to participate in the REACT study, and 56 individuals (60.7% male, average age 62.8 years 11.8) were interviewed in JuneCJuly 2020, up to data saturation. Persistent symptoms, feelings of isolation, fear and stigma, emotional distress, a fatalistic attitude, and return to (adapted) life course were the key themes that characterized the participants experience after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The experience as narrated by the participants in this study confirms the persistence of symptoms described in PASC and highlights the sense of isolation and psychological distress. These phenomena may trigger a vicious circle, but the participants also reported adaptation processes that allowed them to gradually return to their life course. Whether all individuals are able to rapidly activate these mechanisms and whether rehabilitation can help to break this vicious circle by improving residual symptoms remain to be seen.

Carbapenem-resistant organisms are highly prevalent in hospitals associated with difficult-to-treat infections, resulting in poor clinical outcome due to limited treatment options. It is urgently needed to have a rapid, efficient, and convenient molecular assay for identifying such resistant strains. METHODS: For this end, we developed a new laboratory assay targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo--lactamase (NDM) based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification, CRISPRCCas12a, and lateral flow immunochromatographic strip (CRISPRCCas-LAMP-lateral flow strip). The method was designed to use a guide RNA (gRNA) to recognize the target DNA and guide Cas12a to cleave the target DNA, and simultaneously cleave any single-stranded DNA within the cleavage reaction system. RESULTS: The cleavage products are visible to the naked eye on the lateral flow strip. This method is highly sensitive in direct detection of bacteria in samples containing at least 310(5) CFU/mL without the need for bacterial culture. DISCUSSION: It provides shorter turnaround time and higher specificity than the conventional bacterial culture and susceptibility testing method. This new assay is applicable for extensive use in hospital infection control, as well as identification and treatment of resistant strains due to simple operation and inexpensive apparatuses.","output":"A New Method Based on LAMP-CRISPRCCas12a-Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Strip for Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus and its rapid pandemic escalation in all over the world has drawn the attention to urgent need for effective drug development.

The differential diagnosis for upper-extremity pain associated with paresthesias will be the focus of this review. Symptoms are often neurologic in etiology, originating from the spinal cord, nerve root(s), brachial plexus, or peripheral nerve(s). Localizing the pathology starts with a comprehensive understanding of neuromuscular anatomy. It also is imperative to understand the function of these respective structures. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough history, including an assessment of sport-specific risk factors, along with a comprehensive physical examination and functional assessment. It is important to determine the sensory distribution of the patient's symptoms. If weakness also is present, the affected muscles must be identified. While the diagnosis can often be made clinically, electrodiagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound can be used as needed for confirmation and more specific localization. Nonneurologic structures also may be causative or contributory to the patient's symptoms and also should be considered.","output":"Differential Diagnosis for the Painful Tingling Arm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic vaccines for chronic infections and cancer are needed.

Methods We employed exploratory design using qualitative technique. In-depth interviews were conducted with 44 adult (18 years and older) volunteers in four rural communities in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. After thematic analysis using NVivo 11 Pro software, eight sub-themes emerged, among which are: types of FGM practiced, seasons for FGM, FGM by health workers and community leaders, punishment for refusing FGM and knowledge of health implications of FGM. Results Findings show that FGM is more like a process than just an act, and type most practiced in the study area is Type 1. Circumcisers are health workers and women leaders. Knowledge of health implications of FGM was found to be low among those interviewed.

Here, we perform a large-scale, spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic. We derive human mobility from anonymized, aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland; 10 February to 26 April 2020), consisting of a??1.5 billion trips. In comparison to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by 49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than five people, which are estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such, human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7 to 13 d ahead. A 1% reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88 to 1.11% reduction in daily reported COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via telecommunication data can support public decision makers in two ways. First, it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.","output":"Monitoring the COVID-19 epidemic with nationwide telecommunication data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two studies show how the enzyme ACE2 protects against lung injury caused by SARS and other agents.

The wide spectrum of microbial agents underlying the pathology renders the diagnosis of respiratory infections challenging. Molecular diagnostics offer an advantage to the current serological and culture-based methods in terms of sensitivity, coverage, hands-on time, and time to results. Objectives This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection. Study design The performance of FilmArray Respiratory Panel, AnyplexII RV16, and Argene was compared using clinical respiratory samples (n = 224, comprising 189 nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and 35 endotracheal aspirates), based on common overlapping targets across the platforms. Influenza A equivocal and no-subtype samples by FilmArray were further compared to a laboratory-developed Influenza A/B test. Results and Conclusions The overall performance of all three platforms appeared to be comparable with regards to sensitivities (95.8C97.9%) and specificities (96.1C98.0%), detection of coinfections, and distinguishment of influenza from non-influenza cases. Equivocal and no-subtype samples by FilmArray mostly represented weak Influenza A by laboratory-developed test. Lower respiratory tract samples had comparable final-run success-rates and discordant-rates as compared to UTM. Coronavirus HKU1, which was not targeted by AnyplexII RV16, were detected as OC43. The expected test volume would be the main determinant for the selection of platform.

In contrast, exploiting curated biological network, our PathExt tool identifies central genes from the differentially active paths mediating global transcriptomic response. Here we apply PathExt to multiple cell line infection models of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, as well as to COVID-19 patient-derived PBMCs. The central genes mediating SARS-CoV-2 response in cell lines were uniquely enriched for ATP metabolic process, G1/S transition, leukocyte activation and migration. In contrast, PBMC response reveals dysregulated cell-cycle processes. In PBMC, the most frequently central genes are associated with COVID-19 severity. Importantly, relative to differential genes, PathExt-identified genes show greater concordance with several benchmark anti-COVID-19 target gene sets. We propose six novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets ADCY2, ADSL, OCRL, TIAM1, PBK, and BUB1, and potential drugs targeting these genes, such as Bemcentinib, Phthalocyanine, and Conivaptan.","output":"A path-based analysis of infected cell line and COVID-19 patient transcriptome reveals novel potential targets and drugs against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Article impact statement: COVID\\\\19 has demonstrated the need to optimize research activity, convey the gravity of loss, and reevaluate merit in conservation science.","output":"Three lessons conservation science can learn from the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Research is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by the ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths). Methods: We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 64 countries over a period of 78 days (n=4992). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 2.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01], as well as a 1.9 percentage points, decline in the daily growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-22.92%) and CFR (-73.08%). Our results are consistent across different model specifications. Interpretation: We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely available.","output":"Evidence of Protective Role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) Radiation in Reducing COVID-19 Deaths"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By matching socially responsible (SR) stock indexes worldwide with their conventional benchmarks, the authors study the resilience of SR investment strategies during the COVID-19 crisis.

In the first half of 2020, the average daily return was C0.11% for SR indexes and their benchmarks, with annualized volatility of 40% for each. SR indexes remained very close to their benchmarks during both the fever period (February 24CMarch 20) and the rebound period (March 23CMay 29).

Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the views and experiences of clinical pharmacists in relation to the provision of clinical pharmacy services during COVID-19. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with pharmacists working in clinical roles in healthcare settings across Europe. Participants were recruited through professional organisations of clinical and hospitals pharmacists combined with a snowballing technique. The Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework and Disaster Preparedness Framework for pharmacy services were used to generate data which were analysed using the thematic framework method. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants from 16 European countries described a range of measures to protect patients, public and healthcare staff against virus transmission including developing and disseminating educational materials. Most described their involvement in aspects of evidence provision such as facilitating clinical trials, gathering and appraising evidence and disseminating clinical information. Many hospital-based pharmacists were reassigned to new roles such as intensive care. Routine clinical services were extensively interrupted and remote forms of communication were used. Most were motivated by a strong sense of professionalism to continue delivering services. A number of facilitators and barriers to prevention, preparedness and response actions were identified which related to uptake of new roles, recognition of pharmacists roles in the healthcare team, information gathering, communication with patients and healthcare professionals, and provision of routine clinical services. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this multinational qualitative study described a range of service adaptations and adoption of novel roles to prevent and mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic.

From improvements in finding and catching fish to emulating their natural prey and accessing previously inaccessible waters, to anglers sharing their exploits with others, technology is completely changing all aspects of recreational fishing. These innovations would superficially be viewed as positive from the perspective of the angler (aside from the financial cost of purchasing some technologies), yet for the fisheries manager and policy maker, technology may create unintended challenges that lead to reactionary or even ill-defined approaches as they attempt to keep up with these changes. The goal of this paper is to consider how innovations in recreational fishing are changing the way that anglers interact with fish, and thus how recreational fisheries management is undertaken. We use a combination of structured reviews and expert analyses combined with descriptive case studies to highlight the many ways that technology is influencing recreational fishing practice, and, relatedly, what it means for changing how fisheries and/or these technologies need to be managedfrom changes in fish capture, to fish handling, to how anglers share information with each other and with managers. Given that technology is continually evolving, we hope that the examples provided here lead to more and better monitoring of technological innovations and engagement by the management and policy authorities with the recreational fishing sector. Doing so will ensure that management actions related to emerging and evolving recreational fishing technology are more proactive than reactive.","output":"Technological innovations in the recreational fishing sector: implications for fisheries management and policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) which causes severe viral pneumonia rapidly leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Pregnant women are considered more vulnerable to severe viral respiratory infections owing to the physiological changes in pregnancy In COVID-19, patient can present with a variety of symptoms of which dyspnoea is one that is also commonly seen in the late stages of pregnancy The clinical presentation as well as response to therapy is highly variable, and since no conclusive proven treatment is available yet, prevention and symptomatic treatment remains the mainstay of management Thus, we report a case series of four SARS-CoV-2-positive obstetric patients who presented with severe ARDS in a tertiary care hospital, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the clinician, and were managed with a holistic multidisciplinary stepwise approach Through this, an effort has been made to sensitize the attending obstetrician on diverse presentation of COVID-19 disease and to emphasize the importance of prevention, early pick up, and timely optimal management of pneumonia in pregnant females with COVID-19 The clinical presentation of respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy can be mistaken for exaggerated physiological changes of pregnancy leading to delay in seeking medical care During the current pandemic, high suspicion for COVID-19 should be kept If found symptomatic, immediate care should be sought in a designated facility and managed accordingly preferably with a multidisciplinary approach","output":"A Clinical Study on Initial Experience of COVID-19 ARDS in Obstetric Patients at a Tertiary Care Centre in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the clinical, virological and safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)-?-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support. METHODS: We conducted a phase III multicentre, open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), an add-on to the Solidarity trial (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020-000936-23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens and pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, trials of which were stopped prematurely. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants-lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 145), lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-?-1a (n = 145), hydroxychloroquine (n = 145), control (n = 148)-among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR 54-71), and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease.

Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand processes shaping the indoor microbiomes in educational facilities to protect public health by reducing potential exposure risks of students and the broader community. In this study, the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes were characterized in two multifunctional university buildings with contrasting levels of human occupancy, of which one was recently constructed with minimal human occupancy while the other had been in full operation for six years. Higher levels of human occupancy in the older building were shown to result in greater microbial abundance in the indoor environment and greater proportion of the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes contributed from human-associated microbiota, particularly the skin microbiota. It was further revealed that human-associated microbiota had greater influence on the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes in areas of high occupancy than areas of low occupancy. Consistent with minimal impact from human occupancy in a new construction, the indoor microbiomes in the new building exhibited significantly lower influence from human-associated microbiota than in the older building, with microbial taxa originating from soil and plants representing the dominant constituents of the indoor surface bacterial microbiomes. In contrast, microbial taxa in the older building with extensive human occupancy were represented by constituents of the human microbiota, likely from occupants. These findings provide insights into processes shaping the indoor microbiomes which will aid the development of effective strategies to control microbial exposure risks of occupants in educational facilities.

The mechanisms of podocyte and tubulointerstial injury in HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) have been the subject of intense investigation over the past four decades. The pathologic contributions of viral gene expression, dysregulated innate immune signaling, and ancestry-driven genetic risk modifiers have been explored in sophisticated cellular and whole animal models of disease. These studies provide evidence that injury-induced podocyte dedifferentiation, hyperplasia, cytoskeletal dysregulation, and apoptosis may cause the loss of glomerular filtration barrier integrity and slit diaphragm performance that facilitates proteinuria and tuft collapse in HIVAN. Although the incidence of HIVAN has declined with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the collapsing FSGS lesion has been observed in the context of other viral infections and chronic autoimmune disorders, and with the use of interferon-based therapies in genetically susceptible populations. This highlights the fact that the lesion is not specific to HIVAN and that the role of the immune system in aggravating podocyte injury warrants further exploration.

Mechanisms underlying improvements in psychological outcomes are theoretically established but remain unexamined empirically. METHODS: Adult cancer survivors (n = 105) participating in the SMART-3RP completed surveys of resiliency and five hypothesized mediators: coping (ability to relax physical tension and assertive social support-seeking), mindfulness, positive affect, and worry. Pre-post intervention changes were assessed using repeated-measures t-tests. Bivariate correlations between change scores and a more conservative within-person parallel mediation model tested covariance between resiliency and mediators. RESULTS: Participants experienced moderate to large improvements in all patient-reported outcomes (ds = 1.01C0.46). Increased resiliency was significantly associated with increases in mindfulness, positive affect, and assertive social support-seeking (rs = 0.36C0.50); smaller associations with increased relaxation and decreased worry were not significant. Mindfulness and positive affect explained the largest proportion of variance in resiliency increase in the full multivariate model.

The current efforts to target, isolate, and reduce single-use items, particularly plastics, have only recently begun in earnest. Unfortunately, the recovery and recycling of materials have been disrupted by global market uncertainty, and recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic and its impacts complicate materials recovery, the core of the circular economy still depends on efficiently capturing and returning spent materials for production. Arguably, our perception and common understanding of the recovery process is influenced significantly by the recycling of simple consumer products, such as plastic bags and beverage bottles. However, there are greater difficulties when managing multiple materials from significantly more complex consumer products, for example, from end-of-life vehicles. This paper presents an overview of how waste recovery-related issues vary between simple versus complex consumer products. Using food packaging, tires, cell phones, furniture, and end-of-life vehicles as examples, this paper provides a commentary on the challenges facing complex product recovery compared to simple consumer products in the Canadian context in order to establish how this classification concept can be beneficial for describing a given product and its materials recovery prospects.

The Chinese government has formulated effective response measures, and medical personnel have been actively responding to challenges associated with the epidemic prevention and control strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the implementation of a care transition pathway on patients that underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was designed to evaluate the effect of implementing a care transition pathway for patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 pandemic in the orthopedic department of a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Using a convenient sampling method, a total of 96 patients were selected. Of these, 51 patients who had undergone joint replacement in 2019 and received treatment via the routine nursing path were included in the control group. The remaining 45 patients who underwent joint replacement during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 and received therapy via the care transition pathway due to the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures were included in the observation group. The quality of care transition was assessed by the Care Transition Measure (CTM), and patients were followed up 1 week after discharge. RESULTS: The observation group was determined to have better general self-care preparation, written planning materials, doctor-patient communication, health monitoring, and quality of care transition than the control group.

Here we report the field evaluation of a product based on IgY antibodies against group A rotavirus (RVA), coronavirus (CoV), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Salmonella sp. This product, named IgY DNT, has been designed as a complementary passive immunization strategy to prevent neonatal calf diarrhea. The quality of the product depends on the titers of specific IgY antibodies to each antigen evaluated by ELISA. In the case of the viral antigens, ELISA antibody (Ab) titers are correlated with protection against infection in calves experimentally challenged with RVA and CoV (Bok M, et al., Passive immunity to control bovine coronavirus diarrhea in a dairy herd in Argentina, 2017), (Vega C, et al., Vet Immunol Immunopathol, 142:156-69, 2011), (Vega C, et al., Res Vet Sci, 103:1-10, 2015). To evaluate the efficiency in dairy farms, thirty newborn Holstein calves were randomly assigned to IgY DNT or control groups and treatment initiated after colostrum intake and gut closure. Calves in the IgY DNT group received 20 g of the oral passive treatment in 2 L of milk twice a day during the first 2 weeks of life. Animals were followed until 3 weeks of age and diarrhea due to natural exposure to infectious agents was recorded during all the experimental time. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that the oral administration of IgY DNT during the first 2 weeks of life to newborn calves caused a delay in diarrhea onset and significantly reduced its severity and duration compared with untreated calves. Animals treated with IgY DNT showed a trend towards a delay in RVA infection with significantly shorter duration and virus shedding compared to control calves. CONCLUSIONS: This indicates that IgY DNT is an effective product to complement current preventive strategies against neonatal calf diarrhea in dairy farms. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the only biological product available for the prevention of virus-associated neonatal calf diarrhea.","output":"A new passive immune strategy based on IgY antibodies as a key element to control neonatal calf diarrhea in dairy farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute respiratory disease COVID-19, caused by the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide pandemic affecting millions of people. The methodology that organizations who provide home health and personal home care services are using to respond to this pandemic has not yet been characterized. In this report, we describe our approach to comprehensive outbreak suppression and report an initial case series of COVID-19 positive patients receiving home-based services. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across our affiliates, and we communicated these protocols to our offices using multi-faceted methods. Using custom built software applications enabling us to track patient and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission. In the 100-day period between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020, our affiliates provided services to 67 COVID-19 positive patients (&lt;0.3% of census). Twenty patients were referred to home health post hospitalization for COVID-19 related illness, whereas 47 were found to have COVID-19 while living in community settings. Of those who were found to have COVID-19 in the community, 17 (39%) required subsequent hospitalization. Hospitalized patients had an average age of 74.5  18, and 53% were male. There were 13 deaths (76%) among those hospitalized from the community with COVID-19 related illness.

Our objective was to explore the optimal chloroquine phosphate (CQP) dosage regimens for early achievement of virological clearance within 48-72 hours to diminish in-hospital transmission to front-line healthcare workers. A 10,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate both probability of efficacy and safety attainment (PTA) using pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters obtained from the published population PK study. Dosage regimens that early achieved PTA of efficacy (PTAeff ) 90% within 48-72 hours, while maintained PTA of toxicity (PTAtox) 1% were considered optimal. For the previously proposed regimens in published guidelines and clinical studies, all dosage regimens could not achieve 90% PTAeff, except one with the highest dosage regimen. Our simulations suggested that large amount of loading dose was required for the early achievement. We designed three dosage regimens containing high loading dose (2-3 gram per day), which early achieved 90% PTAeff within 48-72 hours, while also maintained 1% PTAtox throughout the treatment course. Further clinical studies are needed to prove the efficacy and safety of our designed regimens.

However, the clinical characteristics of patients who died of COVID-19 in regions with relatively scarce healthcare resources remain unknown. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 14 patients who were admitted from January 18 to February 11, 2020 and died of COVID-19 were evaluated. The epidemiological, symptomatic, laboratory, radiological and treatment records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 14 patients was 56.7 (SD 15.3) years, and 8 (57.1%) were older than 50 years. Eight (57.1%) were men, and 11 (78.6%) had one or more high risk factors. The most common chronic diseases among these patients were cardiovascular disease (7, 50.0%), hypertension (6, 42.9%), and chronic kidney disease (5, 35.7%). General symptoms included cough (12, 85.7%), fever (11, 78.6%), and dyspnea (10, 71.4%). The median duration from the onset of symptoms to death was 11 (IQR 6.5C19.5) days, and the median duration from admission to death was 4.5 (1.0C11.8) days. Patients who died within 4.5 days had more severe pulmonary lesions, significantly reduced lymphocytes and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Most patients had organ dysfunction, including 13 (92.9%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 4 (28.6%) with cardiac injury, 3 (21.4%) with acute kidney injury, and 3 (21.4%) with liver dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with comorbidities, especially those with ARDS and severe chest CT findings on admission, are at increased risk of death and deserve special attention and quality medical treatment.

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics and transmissibility of HIV. Methods: Data on HIV follow-up were collected in Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous, China. An HIV transmission dynamics model was built to simulate the transmission of HIV and estimate its transmissibility by comparing the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) at different stages: the rapid growth period from January 2001 to March 2005, slow growth period from April 2005 to April 2011, and the plateau from May 2011 to December 2019 of HIV in Nanning City. Results: High-risk areas of HIV prevalence in Nanning City were mainly concentrated in suburbs. Furthermore, high-risk groups were those of older age, with lower income, and lower education levels. The R(eff) in each stage (rapid growth, slow growth, and plateau) were 2.74, 1.62, and 1.15, respectively, which suggests the transmissibility of HIV in Nanning City has declined and prevention and control measures have achieved significant results. Conclusion: Over the past 20 years, the HIV incidence in Nanning has remained at a relatively high level, but its development trend has been curbed. Transmissibility was reduced from 2.74 to 1.15.

When calculated with this model, the uninfected population S decreases with the passage of time. However, when the EIOP N increases because of any reason, the infection threshold becomes larger than 1. Even after the first wave seems to have subsided, the infection begins to spread again. Firstly, we find the curve of EIOP change so that the calculation result by this model matches the data of the first and second waves. Then, we use this curve to fit with only the data of the second wave alone, and the third wave is predicted. In the case of new coronavirus infection, there are various restrictions on data collection to identify individual coefficients of mathematical models, and the true value is almost unknown. Therefore, the discussion in this paper is only about data fitting for predictive calculation. Therefore, the simulation on the true value is not aimed. However, since the data of infected persons reflect the true values, the results of data fitting can be used for the prediction of infected persons, isolated care recipients, inpatients, and severely ill persons. They are useful for a qualitative understanding of infection. The idea of EIOP is important in the sense that it connects the mean-field and the non-mean field, but the existence of data is essential, and the theory alone cannot simulate the non-mean field.

Although process mining was originally conceived to facilitate business process management activities, research studies have shown the benefit of leveraging process mining tools in different contexts, including healthcare. However, applying process mining tools to analyse healthcare process execution data is not straightforward. In this paper, we report the analysis of an event log recording more than 30 million events capturing the general practice healthcare processes of more than one million patients in Victoria--Australia--over five years. Our analysis allowed us to understand benefits and limitations of the state-of-the-art process mining techniques when dealing with highly variable processes and large data-sets. While we provide solutions to the identified limitations, the overarching goal of this study was to detect differences between the patients\` health services utilization pattern observed in 2020--during the COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory lock-downs --and the one observed in the prior four years, 2016 to 2019. By using a combination of process mining techniques and traditional data mining, we were able to demonstrate that vaccinations in Victoria did not drop drastically--as other interactions did. On the contrary, we observed a surge of influenza and pneumococcus vaccinations in 2020, contradicting research findings of similar studies conducted in different geographical areas.","output":"Process Mining-Driven Analysis of the COVID19 Impact on the Vaccinations of Victorian Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The discovery of new drugs and dosage forms for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases, such as human and animal leishmaniasis, is gaining interest in the chemical, biological, pharmaceutical, and medical fields. Many pharmaceutical companies are exploring the use of old drugs to establishing new drug dosage forms and drug delivery systems, in particular for use in neglected diseases. The formation of complexes with cyclodextrins is widely used to improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of pharmaceutical drugs, as well as reduce both the toxicity and side effects of many of these drugs. The aim of this study was to characterize solid compounds obtained from the association between furazolidone (FZD) and -cyclodextrin (-CD) or hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (HP--CD). The solid compounds were prepared in molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (drug:CD) by kneading and lyophilization. Molecular docking was used to predict the preferred relative orientation of FZD when bound in both studied cyclodextrins. The resulting solid compounds were qualitatively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (DSC and TG/DTG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy with image mapping (Raman mapping), and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR) in the solid state. The cytotoxicity of the compounds against THP-1 macrophages and the 50% growth inhibition (IC50) against Leishmania amazonensis promastigote forms were subsequently investigated using in vitro techniques. For all of the solid compounds obtained, the existence of an association between FZD and CD were confirmed by one or more characterization techniques (TG/DTG, DSC, SEM, XRD, RAMAN, and 13C NMR), particularly by a significant decrease in the crystallinity of these materials and a reduction in the melting enthalpy associated with furazolidone thermal events. The formation of more effective interactions occurred in the compounds prepared by lyophilization, in a 1:2 molar ratio of the two CDs studied. However, the formation of an inclusion complex was confirmed only for the solid compound obtained from HP--CD prepared by lyophilization (LHFZD1:2). The absence of cytotoxicity on the THP-1 macrophage lineages and the leishmanicidal activity were confirmed for all compounds. MHFZD1:2 and LHFZD1:2 were found to be very active against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis, while all others were considered only active. These results are in line with the literature, demonstrating the existence of biological activity for associations between drugs and CDs in the form of complexes and non-complexes. All solid compounds obtained were found to be promising for use as leishmanicidal agents against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis.","output":"Physicochemical characterization and in vitro biological evaluation of solid compounds from furazolidone-based cyclodextrins for use as leishmanicidal agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate and automatic detection of mood serves as a building block for use cases like user profiling which in turn power applications such as advertising, recommendation systems, and many more. One primary source indicative of an individual's mood is textual data. While there has been extensive research on emotion recognition, the field of mood prediction has been barely explored. In addition, very little work is done in the area of on-device inferencing, which is highly important from the user privacy point of view. In this paper, we propose for the first time, an on-device deep learning approach for mood prediction from textual data, LEAPMood. We use a novel on-device deployment-focused objective function for hyperparameter tuning based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and optimize the parameters concerning both performance and size. LEAPMood consists of Emotion Recognition in Conversion (ERC) as the first building block followed by mood prediction using K-means clustering. We show that using a combination of character embedding, phonetic hashing, and attention along with Conditional Random Fields (CRF), results in a performance closely comparable to that of the current State-Of-the-Art with a significant reduction in model size (>90%) for the task of ERC. We achieve a Micro F1 score of 62.05% with a memory footprint of a mere 1.67MB on the DailyDialog dataset.

Materials and Methods A total of 25 Candida spp. isolated from hospitalized patients with COVID-19, who were suspected to have pulmonary candidiasis, and 26 archived Candida spp. specimens were enrolled in this study. For the identification of Candida spp., PCR was performed to detect and amplify the ITS1 and ITS4 genes. Then the products were subjected to the Msp I restriction enzyme to precisely identify the species. The amplification of the WHP1 gene was conducted to identify Candida albicans species. The antifungal activities of routine drugs and the synthesize AuNPs against Candida spp. were assessed based on the protocols presented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M60. Results In the present study, C. albicans (24; 96%) and C. parapsilosis (1; 4%) were identified as the etiologic agents of the pulmonary candidiasis associated with the COVID-19 infection. Voriconazol and amphotericin B had superior activity against all the isolates in this study. Treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole did not significantly change the formation of colony-forming units (CFU). However, treatment with the AuNPs significantly decreased (within the range of 92-99.1%; P<0.05) the number of CFUs.

Failure to generate hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific antibodies is well-known in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, whether and to what extent HBV-specific cellular immunity is altered in this population and how it influences humoral immunity is not clear. To address it, we analyzed HBV-reactive T cells and antibodies in hemodialysis patients post vaccination. 29 hemodialysis patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, HBV-reactive T cells were analyzed and functionally dissected based on granzyme B, interferon- (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 expression. Importantly, HBV-reactive CD4(+) T cells were detected not only in all patients with sufficient titers but also in 70% of non-responders. Furthermore, a correlation between the magnitude of HBV-reactive CD4(+) T cells and post-vaccination titers was observed. In summary, our data showed that HBV-reactive polyfunctional T cells were present in the majority of hemodialysis patients even if humoral immunity failed. Further studies are required to confirm their in vivo antiviral capacity.

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote workers who were not directly affected by COVID-19. METHODS: This was a correlational cross-sectional study (with an additional qualitative component) of 184 remote workers surveyed during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Standard measures of mental health (Kessler-6 Distress Scale), productivity (Brief Instrument to Assess Workers Productivity During a Working Day), and physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) were used, and respondents were further surveyed on changes to their dietary, exercise, smoking, drinking, and socialization habits to produce a well-being change index. RESULTS: The results revealed associations between sedentary behavior and poorer mental health ((b)=0.14) and between poorer mental health and low work productivity ((b)=C0.39). However, both positive and negative lifestyle changes were reported; a self-reported increase in well-being (with respect to diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, and socialization) since the start of the pandemic was associated with both better mental health ((b)=C0.14) and better work productivity ((b)=0.14). Of note, among respondents without a mental health diagnosis (137/184, 74.4%), we observed rates of moderate (76/137, 55.5%) and severe (17/137, 12.4%) psychological distress, which were markedly higher than those reported in large prepandemic studies; moreover, 70.1% (129/184) of our respondents reported more sedentary behavior, 41% (69/168) increased their alcohol consumption, and 38.6% (71/184) increased their overall food intake. However, 46% (75/163), 44.8% (39/87) and 51.8% (57/110) of respondents reported spending more time walking and engaging in more moderate and vigorous exercise, respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed many positive adaptations to lockdowns (eg, decreased commuting expenses, flexibility) but also a number of structural obstacles to remote working (eg, lack of support and high expectations from employers, childcare duties). CONCLUSIONS: These findings may be of practical importance for policy makers and employers in a world in which work involves long-term remote or hybrid employment arrangements; strategies to promote more sustainable remote working are discussed.","output":"Influence of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Physical and Psychosocial Well-being and Work Productivity of Remote Workers: Cross-sectional Correlational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spring, summer and autumn 2020, one abiding argument against controlled human infection (CHI) studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been their impact on local communities.

They recommended either avoiding CHI trials or engaging local communities before conducting any CHIs. Similar recommendations were not made for the alternative-standard phase III field trials of these same vaccines. We argue that the health effects of CHI studies on local residents not participating in the study tend to be smaller and more positive than those of field trials. That is all the more so now that tested vaccines are being rolled out.

Methods A total of 122 subjects with COVID-19 were included: 106 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients and 16 RT-PCR-negative patients with symptoms and chest computed tomography (CT) consistent with COVID-19. Ninety-six historical blood donation samples were used as controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic records. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were their 95% binomial confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3. Results The sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay in all RT-PCR-positive inpatients, irrespective of the timing of symptom onset, was 85.8% (95% binomial CI 77.7% to 91.9%). This increased with time after symptom onset, and at >14 days was 94.9% (85.9% to 98.9%). The specificity was 100% (96.4% to 100%). 15/16 (94%) RT- PCR-negative cases tested positive. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. All RT-PCR-negative patients had pneumonia. The most frequent thoracic CT findings were ground glass changes (n = 11, 68%), which were bilateral in 9 (56%) patients, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates (n = 5, 31%).

However, its association with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has not been described. We aimed to examine the possible link between CMV replication and CAPA occurrence. Methods: A single-center, retrospective caseCcontrol study was conducted. A case was defined as a patient diagnosed with CAPA according to 2020 ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria. Two controls were selected for each case among critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: In total, 24 CAPA cases were included, comprising 14 possible CAPA and 10 probable CAPA. Additionally, 48 matched controls were selected. CMV replication was detected more frequently in CAPA than in controls (75.0% vs. 35.4%, p = 0.002). Probable CMV end-organ disease was more prevalent in CAPA (20.8% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.037).

The BC COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns survey (BC-Mix) was established as a surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the demographic characteristics of respondents. Methods The ongoing repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow up survey is sent to participants two to four weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are weighted to BC population by age, sex, geography, and ethnicity to obtain generalizable estimates. Additional indices such as the material and social deprivation index, residential instability, economic dependency, and others are generated using census and location data. Results As of July 26, 2021, over 61,000 baseline survey responses were received of which 41,375 were eligible for analysis. Of the eligible participants, about 60% consented to follow up and about 27% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with healthcare databases. Approximately 50% of respondents were female, 39% were 55 years or older, 65% identified as white and 50% had at least a university degree.

The first experiment evaluated the effects of 3 ANC in combination with an antimicrobial in high-risk calves treated for BRD during a 56-d receiving period. Newly received crossbred steers (n = 516; initial BW = 217  20 kg) were monitored by trained personnel for clinical signs of BRD. Calves that met antimicrobial treatment criteria (n = 320) were then randomly assigned to experimental ANC treatment (80 steers/experimental ANC treatment): intravenous flunixin meglumine injection (NSAID), intranasal viral vaccination (VACC), intramuscular vitamin C injection (VITC), or no ANC (NOAC). Animal served as the experimental unit for all variables except DMI and G:F (pen served as the experimental unit for DMI and G:F). Within calves treated 3 times for BRD, those receiving NOAC had lower (P < 0.01) clinical severity scores (severity scores ranged from 0 to 4 on the basis of observed clinical signs and severity) and heavier (P = 0.01) BW than those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC at the time of third treatment. Between the second and third BRD treatments, calves receiving NOAC had decreased (P < 0.01) daily BW loss (?0.13 kg ADG) compared with those receiving NSAID, VACC, or VITC (?1.30, ?1.90, and ?1.41 kg ADG, respectively). There were no differences in rectal temperature, combined mortalities and removals, or overall performance among the experimental ANC treatments. Overall, morbidity and mortality attributed to BRD across treatments were 66.5% and 13.2%, respectively. After the receiving period, a subset of calves (n = 126) were allocated to finishing pens to evaluate the effects ANC administration on finishing performance, carcass characteristics, and lung scores at harvest. Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common physiological end point for each pen of calves. There were no differences among the experimental ANC observed during the finishing period (P  0.11).

This widespread of IPA use could potentially, but not necessarily, be responsible for an increase in IPA poisoning cases (e.g., in alcoholics and/or for suicide attempt, even more in a lockdown situation). Forensic identification of IPA-related fatalities remains challenging as IPA post mortem detection can also result from antemortem or post mortem production, or post mortem contamination. In order to illustrate this issue, we report the case of a 33-year-old man found dead with a bottle of pure IPA liquid close to him. Toxicological positive results only consisted in IPA (464, 260, 465 and 991 mg/L) and acetone (1560, 2340, 3040 and 1360 mg/L) in blood, vitreous humour, urine and bile, respectively (determinations using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection). These IPA absolute concentrations and IPA-to-acetone ratios appear inferior to those usually reported in the literature (higher than 1000 mg/L and 1.1, respectively) in IPA poisoning cases. In conclusion, this death can be cautiously regarded as an IPA ingestion-related fatality in the hypothesis of a survival time which have promoted IPA metabolism to acetone: this hypothesis is supported by the putative limited IPA-ingested dose. This report emphasizes the fact that post mortem IPA and acetone concentration interpretation involves to take account of (i) results in multiple biological specimens, (ii) complete case history, and (iii) a search of possible IPA presence at the scene of death.","output":"Putatively lethal ingestion of isopropyl alcohol-related case: interpretation of post mortem isopropyl alcohol and acetone concentrations remains challenging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vitamin D has numerous mechanistic roles within the immune system. There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers. Methods: The study included an observational cohort of healthcare workers who isolated due to COVID-19 symptoms from 12th to 22nd May 2020, from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT). This was part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). Data collected included SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion status, serum 25(OH)D3 levels as well as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, ethnicity, job role, and co-morbidities. Participants were grouped into four vitamin D (VD) categories. 1) Severe VD deficiency (VD <30 nmol/L); 2) VD deficiency (VD > or equal to 30 nmol/L and <50 nmol/L); 3) VD insufficiency (VD > or equal to 50 nmol/L and <75 nmol/L); 4) VD sufficiency (VD > or equal to 75 nmol/L). Results: When VD levels were compared against COVID-19 seropositivity rate, a U-shaped curve was identified in the total population. This trend repeated when split into subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and co-morbidity status. Significant difference was identified in the COVID-19 seropositivity rate between VD groups between multiple VD groups in the total population, males, females, BAME, BMI<30 (kg/m2), 0 and +1 comorbidities; the majority of which were differences when the severely VD deficient category were compared to the other group. A significantly larger proportion of those within the Black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) group (vs. white ethnicity) were severely vitamin D deficient (P <0.00001). A significantly higher proportion of the 0-comorbidity subgroup were vitamin D deficient in comparison to the 1+ comorbidity subgroup (P = 0.046). Conclusions: Further investigation of the U-shaped curves is required to determine whether high VD levels can have a detrimental effect on susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Future randomised clinical trials of VD supplementation could potentially identify optimal VD levels. This would allow for targeted therapeutic treatment for those at-risk such as in the BAME group.","output":"Vitamin D Status: A U-shaped relationship for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in UK healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Triggered by the prevention of the spread of COVID-19, two types of surgical masks became available to health systems: disposable and reusable. The purpose of our study was to assess whether there is an economic and ecological difference in the application of reusable surgical masks versus disposable surgical masks. Methods: We developed a de novo model that took into account the characteristics of the Belgian hospital market: 52000 beds, 2 healthcare FTE per bed, and the ability to rely on a disposable surgical mask versus a reusable surgical mask that could be reused up to 35 times. We considered the following costs: product cost, medical waste, logistics, and washing. Results: From an ecological and supply chain point of view the implementation of reusable masks could result in a reduction of 92.000 Kilograms of medical waste and 90% less warehouse space required. From an economic point of view when the cost per disposable mask goes above 0.10  per unit, material economic savings were identified. As from 0.15  per unit of disposable masks, economic savings varied between 1.5 million and 10 million  per year. The critical factors that define the possible economic savings include: the base price of the reusable mask, the cost of washing, as well as the number of times that a mask could be reused. Conclusions: Health systems may benefit from the inclusion of reusable surgical masks versus disposable surgical masks. This benefit is fourfold. Gains could be achieved from an ecological, supply chain risk mitigation, warehousing optimization, as well as from an economic perspective.","output":"PNS12 Can a Reusable Surgical Face Mask Bring Health Economic and Ecological Benefit to a Health System upon the Outbreak of an Emerging Pathogen?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has necessitated almost exclusive National Health Service focus on emergency work and cancer care. There are concerns that increased hospital and community pressures will lead to decreased referrals and worse outcomes for head and neck cancer patients. METHOD: This is a retrospective review of all cases referred for suspected head and neck cancer to our institution in January and April 2020. RESULTS: There was a 55 per cent decrease in referrals but diagnostic yield rose from 2.9 per cent in January to 8.06 per cent in April. In both months, 100 per cent of patients met the 31- and 62-day targets, with similar 14-day wait time success (97.83 per cent for January vs 98.33 per cent for April). Referrals for laryngopharyngeal reflux rose from 27.5 per cent to 41.9 per cent. Referrals for those aged over 60 years fell from 42 per cent to 26 per cent. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that further research be conducted into the reasons why fewer patients were referred, particularly elderly patients, and why laryngopharyngeal reflux is so prevalent in fast-track referrals.","output":"The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on head and neck cancer services: a UK tertiary centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) published 2 alcohol-based formulations to be used in healthcare settings and for outbreak-associated infections, but inactivation efficacies of these products have not been determined against (re-)emerging viruses.

The new sampling device, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that forced many countries to impose mandatory facemasks, allows an easy monitoring of the subject's exposure to different compounds they may come in contact with, actively or passively. The project combines the advantages of a fabric-phase sorptive membrane (FPSM) as an in vivo sampling device with a validated LC-MS/MS screening procedure able to monitor more than 739 chemicals with an overall analysis time of 18 min. The project involves the noninvasive in vivo sampling of the EBA using an FPSM array inserted inside an FFP2 mask. The study involved 15 healthy volunteers, and no restrictions were imposed during or prior to the sampling process regarding the consumption of drinks, food, or drugs. The FPSM array-LC-MS/MS approach allowed us to effectively exploit the advantages of the two complementary procedures (the convenient sampling by an FPSM array and the rapid analysis by LC-MS/MS), obtaining a powerful and green tool to carry out rapid screening analyses for human exposure to different compounds. The flexible fabric substrate, the sponge-like porous architecture of the high-efficiency sol-gel sorbent coating, the availability of a large cache of sorbent coatings, including polar, nonpolar, mixed mode, and zwitterionic phases, the easy installation into the facemask, and the possibility of sampling without interrupting regular activities provide FPSMs unparalleled advantages over other sampling techniques, and their applications are expected to expand to many other clinical or toxicological studies.","output":"Fabric-Phase Sorptive Membrane Array As a Noninvasive In Vivo Sampling Device For Human Exposure To Different Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE to understand how the contradictions and tensions of neoliberal policy, materialized in precarious work, affect nursing workers' mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: We summarized the current literature related to COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and neurology. Overall, we found either no difference or modest differences in risk for severe COVID-19 for people with immune-mediated diseases compared with the general population. When considering disease-specific factors, glucocorticoid use and underlying immune-mediated disease activity were generally associated with worse outcomes. Specific medications varied in associations: tumor necrosis factor inhibitors generally had lower odds for severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas rituximab use generally had higher odds for severe outcomes. We also detailed the recent reports of antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. SUMMARY: Investigations of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases across several organ systems have offered important insight into the COVID-19 disease course.

The TUTs' objective, in spite of corona-related restrictions and strict hygiene requirements during the pandemic, was to provide fellow students with the opportunity to learn, practice and reflect on clinical-practical skills. Methodology: In a collaborative undertaking, the TUTs first analyzed the learning objectives of the in-person tutorials in order to be able to design content-matched digital tutorials without entirely abandoning the practical aspect. The Moodle learning management platform was selected as the appropriate tool for delivery of the relevant theoretical knowledge. Practical exercises are embedded in the digital tutorials during online meetings. The participants (PTs) create their own models in the sense of a home skills station based on instructions provided via Moodle. Acceptance was systematically documented via questionnaires. Results: The digital tutorials were well accepted by the PTs (n=64). Evaluation (response rate: 37.5%) outcomes were consistently positive. Both course implementation and the PTs' own progress were rated good to very good. Nevertheless, the PTs do not yet feel well-prepared to carry out the various activities practiced independently. In the winter semester of 2020/21, the in-person tutorials were also reintroduced in a combined format. The marked demand for the tutorials may indicate the PT preference for practice on the simulation center models. Conclusion: The systematic combination of digital and in-person tutorials using the flipped classroom approach would appear to make sense in the long run.

The study has been carried out in the Community of Madrid, which has the highest number of cases in Spain. The objective is to understand the incidence of COVID-19, the course of the disease if it occurs and the psychosocial and occupational impact on this population. METHODS: We included 345 patients (246 of haemophilia, 69 of von Willebrand Disease, two rare bleeding disorders and 28 carriers of haemophilia). A telephone survey was used to collect the data. RESULTS: Forty-two patients presented symptoms suggestive of infection by COVID-19, and in six cases, the disease was confirmed by RT-PCR. The cumulative incidence of our series was 1.73%. It is worth noting the complexity of the management of COVID-19 in two patients on prophylaxis with non-factor replacement therapy.

In the early stages of immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are susceptible to infection with the same enteric pathogens that cause diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts, but with progressive immunodeficiency, these patients become susceptible to numerous opportunistic disorders. The main factor to consider when tailoring the work-up of diarrhea in the HIV-infected patient is the immune status, which is reflected by the total CD4 lymphocyte cell count. A CD4 count of less than 100 cells/microL is significantly correlated with opportunistic disorders. For the HIV-infected patient with diarrhea, repeated stool studies to investigate for bacteria, ova and parasites should be the first step. When either upper or lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms are present and stool studies are negative, endoscopy directed to the probable organ of involvement is appropriate. If localizing symptoms are absent, the most appropriate next test is sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. Not infrequently, despite extensive evaluation, the cause of diarrhea in patients with AIDS remains unexplained. Recently, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, has led to a change in the epidemiology of diarrhea in AIDS patients. As their immune status improves, HIV-infected patients treated with combination therapy become less prone to opportunistic disorders.

It is well-known that these agents can prolong the QTc interval and potentially induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP). We aim to assess the prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmic events in COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs. METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to September 30, 2020 for studies reporting peak QTc &#8805;500 ms, peak QTc change &#8805;60 ms, peak QTc interval, peak change of QTc interval, ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, or atrioventricular block (AVB). All meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies (three case series, 35 cohorts, and nine randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) involving 13 087 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of peak QTc &#8805;500 ms was 9% (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3%-18%) and 8% (95%CI, 3%-14%) in patients who received hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin, respectively. Likewise, the use of hydroxychloroquine (risk ratio [RR], 2.68; 95%CI, 1.56-4.60) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (RR, 3.28; 95%CI, 1.16-9.30) was associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation compared to no treatment. Ventricular arrhythmias, TdP, sudden cardiac death, and AVB were reported in <1% of patients across treatment groups. The only two studies that reported individual data of lopinavir/ritonavir found no cases of QTc prolongation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine with or without azithromycin had a relatively high prevalence and risk of QTc prolongation. However, the prevalence of arrhythmic events was very low, probably due to underreporting. The limited information about lopinavir/ritonavir showed that it does not prolong the QTc interval.","output":"QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, or lopinavir/ritonavir: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The South Korean government effectively contained the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak primarily associated with a religious group.

Through 60 in-depth interviews with 30 trans-Himalayan participants (ages of 16C23) and multi-sited ethnography throughout Nepal, this paper investigates multiple experiences of crises experienced by young people and the effects on their life course trajectories. From focusing on the Civil War in 1996C2006, the 2015 earthquake, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper proposes that initial displacements from the Civil War, when connected with other crises later on in a participants life course, better prepared them to deal with crises and enabled them to create a landscape of resilience. Furthermore, a landscape of resilience that connects past and present life course experiences during crises prepared some participants for helping their larger communities alleviate certain crises-related tension. Overall, this paper extends analysis on an under-researched group of young migrants by connecting crises that shaped their (im)mobility and life trajectories, rather than approaching crises as singular, isolated experiences.","output":"Connecting Crises: Young People in Nepal Reflecting on Life Course Transitions and Trajectories during Times of Uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and antigen tests are important diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity of antigen tests has been shown to be lower than that of rRT-PCR; however, data to evaluate epidemiologic characteristics that affect test performance are limited. METHODS: Paired mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected from university students and staff and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using both Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) and rRT-PCR assay. Specimens positive by either rRT-PCR or antigen FIA were placed in viral culture and tested for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate characteristics associated with antigen results, rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, sgRNA, and viral culture. RESULTS: Antigen FIA sensitivity was 78.9% and 43.8% among symptomatic and asymptomatic participants respectively. Among rRT-PCR positive participants, negative antigen results were more likely among asymptomatic participants (OR 4.6, CI:1.3-15.4) and less likely among participants reporting nasal congestion (OR 0.1, CI:0.03-0.8). rRT-PCR-positive specimens with higher Ct values (OR 0.5, CI:0.4-0.8) were less likely, and specimens positive for sgRNA (OR 10.2, CI:1.6-65.0) more likely, to yield positive virus isolation. Antigen testing was >90% positive in specimens with Ct values <29. Positive predictive value of antigen test for positive viral culture (57.7%) was similar to that of rRT-PCR (59.3%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antigen test advantages include low cost, wide availability and rapid turnaround time, making them important screening tests. The performance of antigen tests may vary with patient characteristics, so performance characteristics should be accounted for when designing testing strategies and interpreting results.","output":"Epidemiologic characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based test results, rRT-PCR cycle threshold values, subgenomic RNA, and viral culture results from university testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had broad disruptive effects on economies, healthcare systems, governments, societies, and individuals.

Platelets are sentinel markers of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Experiments were designed to evaluate the time course and mechanism of direct interactions between platelets and leukocytes following acute activation of TLR4 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood from age-matched male and female wild type (WT) and TLR4 gene deleted (dTLR4) mice was incubated with ultra-pure E. coli LPS (500 ng/ml) for up to one hour. At designated periods, leukocyte antigen positive platelets, platelet antigen positive leukocytes and cell-derived MV were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of platelet- or leukocyte-derived MV did not increase within one hour following in vitro exposure of blood to LPS. However, with LPS stimulation numbers of platelets staining positive for both platelet- and leukocyte-specific antigens increased in blood derived from WT but not dTLR4 mice. This effect was blocked by inhibition of TLR4 signaling mediated by My88 and TRIF. Seven days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (500 ng/mouse or 20 ng/gm body wt) to WT mice, none of the platelets stained for leukocyte antigen. However, granulocytes, monocytes and apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Within one hour of exposure to LPS, leukocytes exchange surface antigens with platelets through TLR4 activation. In vivo, leukocyte expression of platelet antigen is retained after a single exposure to LPS following turn over of the platelet pool. Acute expression of leukocyte antigen on platelets within one hour of exposure to LPS and the sustained expression of platelet antigen on leukocytes following a single acute exposure to LPS in vivo explains, in part, associations of platelets and leukocytes in response to bacterial infection and changes in thrombotic propensity of the blood.","output":"Leukocyte- and Platelet-Derived Microvesicle Interactions following In Vitro and In Vivo Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 4 by Lipopolysaccharide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).

Given the stressful nature of medical disciplines, considerable attention must be paid to student support systems during pandemics. This study aimed to review the current literature regarding medical student support systems systematically. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of six databases and grey literature sources in addition to a hand search in the references of the articles on April 5, 2021. We included all studies about support for undergraduate medical students delivered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In conducting this review, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: A total of 3646 articles were retrieved from the databases, and 16 additional papers were extracted from other sources. After removing duplicates, we screened 2434 titles and abstracts according to our criteria. Among them, 32 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Ultimately, 10 studies were included for review. We identified two major themes: (a) academic support and (b) mental health support. All of the included studies utilized online methods whether for transitioning from previous support systems or developing novel approaches. Students and faculty members seemed to be receptive to these new systems. Despite indicating outstanding program outcomes, most studies merely described the positive effects of the program rather than providing a precise evaluation. CONCLUSION: There are several methods of supporting medical students who are experiencing unprecedented changes in their educational trajectory. Due to substantial differences in undergraduate medical education in different regions of the world, cultural and contextual-oriented support is indispensable for developing a safe learning environment.

Activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) functions as a central hub in this signaling. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 opposes Syk activity; stimulation of NADPH oxidase by FcRI activation results in the production of oxidants that reversibly inhibit SHP-1, up-regulating the signal from Syk. Activated AMPK can suppress Syk activation by the FcRI receptor, possibly reflecting its ability to phosphorylate the FcRI beta subunit. Cyclic GMP, via protein kinase G II, enhances the activity of SHP-1 by phosphorylating its C-terminal region; this may explain its inhibitory impact on mast cell activation. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) likewise opposes mast cell activation; H(2)S can boost AMPK activity, up-regulate cGMP production, and trigger Nrf2-mediated induction of Phase 2 enzymes C including heme oxygenase-1, whose generation of bilirubin suppresses NADPH oxidase activity. Phycocyanobilin (PCB), a chemical relative of bilirubin, shares its inhibitory impact on NADPH oxidase, rationalizing reported anti-allergic effects of PCB-rich spirulina ingestion. Phase 2 inducer nutraceuticals can likewise oppose the up-regulatory impact of NADPH oxidase on FcRI signaling. AMPK can be activated with the nutraceutical berberine. High-dose biotin can boost cGMP levels in mast cells via direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Endogenous generation of H(2)S in mast cells can be promoted by administering N-acetylcysteine and likely by taurine, which increases the expression of H(2)S-producing enzymes in the vascular system.

Headache and visual disturbances are frequent complaints of IIH patients, but little is known about other symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the patients perspective on the burden of IIH. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we developed an online survey for patients with IIH containing standardized evaluations of headache (HIT-6), sleep (PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale) and depression (MDI) in relation to BMI, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) and treatment. RESULTS: Between December 2019 and February 2020, 306 patients completed the survey. 285 (93 %) were female, mean age was 36.6 years ( 10.8), mean BMI 34.2 ( 7.3) and mean LP OP at diagnosis was 37.8 cmH(2)O ( 9.5). 219 (72 %) of the participants were obese (BMI  30); 251 (82 %) reported severe impacting headaches, 140 (46 %) were suffering from sleep disturbances and 169 (56 %) from depression. Higher MDI scores correlated with higher BMI and increased sleep disturbances. Patients with a normalized LP opening pressure reported less headaches, less sleep disturbances and less depression than those with a constantly elevated opening pressure. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to headaches and visual disturbances, sleep disturbances and depression are frequent symptoms in IIH and contribute to the patients burden. Structured questionnaires can help to identify IIH patients needs and can lead to personalized and better treatment.

Cognitive abilities are acquired during early childhood as part of progressive neurodevelopmental milestones; unfortunately, regressive changes can occur as part of physiological aging, or more ominously, pathological diseases, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Cases of AD and its milder subset, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are rising and would impose a burdensome impact beyond the individual level. Various dietary and nutritional approaches have potential for promising results in managing cognitive deterioration. Glucose is the core source of bioenergy in the body; however, glucose brain metabolism could be affected in aging cells or due to disease development. Ketone bodies are an efficient alternate fuel source that could compensate for the deficient glycolytic metabolism upon their supra-physiologic availability in the blood (ketosis), which, in turn, could promote cognitive benefits and tackle disease progression. In this review, we describe the potential of ketogenic approaches to produce cognitive benefits in healthy individuals, as well as those with MCI and AD. Neurophysiological changes of the cognitive brain in response to ketosis through neuroimaging modalities are also described in this review to provide insight into the ketogenic effect on the brain outside the framework of purely molecular explanations.","output":"The Implication of Physiological Ketosis on The Cognitive Brain: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To determine how hospitals across the United States determined allocation criteria for remdesivir, approved in May 2020 for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through an emergency use authorization, while maintaining fair and ethical distribution when patient needs exceeded supply. METHODS: A electronic survey inquiring as to how institutions determined remdesivir allocation was developed. On June 17, 2020, an invitation with a link to the survey was posted on the Vizient Pharmacy Network Community pages and via email to the American College of Clinical Pharmacys Infectious Disease Practice and Research Network listserver. RESULTS: 66 institutions representing 28 states responded to the survey. The results showed that 98% of surveyed institutions used a multidisciplinary team to develop remdesivir allocation criteria. A majority of those teams included clinical pharmacists (indicated by 97% of respondents), adult infectious diseases physicians (94%), and/or adult intensivists (69%). Many teams included adult hospitalists (49.2%) and/or ethicists (35.4%). Of the surveyed institutions, 59% indicated that all patients with COVID-19 were evaluated for treatment, and 50% delegated initial patient identification for potential remdesivir use to treating physicians. Prioritization of remdesivir allocation was often determined on a first come, first served basis (47% of respondents), according to a patients respiratory status (28.8%) and/or clinical course (24.2%), and/or by random lottery (22.7%). Laboratory parameters (10.6%), comorbidities (4.5%), and essential worker status (4.5%) were rarely included in allocation criteria; no respondents reported consideration of socioeconomic disadvantage or use of a validated scoring system. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inconsistencies of US medical centers methods for allocating a limited pharmacotherapy resource that required rapid, fair, ethical and equitable distribution.

Whole genome sequencing has, in recent years, emerged as a reliable tool for capsular typing and antimicrobial resistance prediction. This study characterized vaginal and rectal isolates of Group B Streptococcus obtained from pregnant women in Port Harcourt, Nigeria using a whole-genome sequence-based approach. RESULTS: Capsular types Ia, Ib, II, III, IV and V were detected among the 43 isolates sequenced. Twelve sequence types (STs) were identified, with ST19 (n = 9, 27.3 %) and ST486 (n = 5, 15.2 %) the most frequent among non-duplicated isolates. Of the alpha-like proteins (alp) identified, Alp1 was the most prevalent in 11 (33.3 %) isolates. Macrolide and lincosamide resistance determinants were present in 15 (45.5 %) isolates; ermB was detected in 1 (3 %), ermTR in 7 (21.2 %) isolates, lnu gene was detected in 6 (18.2 %) and mef was identified in 3 (9.1 %) isolates. Resistance of GBS to erythromycin and clindamycin (predicted from presence of erm or mef genes) was found to be 30.3 % and 24.2 %, respectively. All isolates were predicted resistant to tetracycline with only the tetM gene identified. Fluoroquinolone-resistance conferring substitutions in gyrA + parC were detected in 9 (27.3 %) isolates and chloramphenicol resistance was predicted from presence of aac6-aph2 gene in 11 (33.3 %).

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the molar ratio of DOTAP/chol, PEGylation, and lipid to mRNA ratio on mRNA transfection, and explore the applications of DOTAP/chol LNPs in pDNA and oligonucleotide transfection. Here we showed that PEGylation significantly decreased mRNA transfection efficiency of DOTAP/chol LNPs. Among non-PEGylated LNP formulations, 1:3 molar ratio of DOTAP/chol in DOTAP/chol LNPs showed the highest mRNA transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of DOTAP/chol LNPs to mRNA was tested to be 62.5 M lipid to 1 g mRNA. More importantly, these mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were stable for 60 days at 4 C storage without showing reduction in transfection efficacy. We further found that DOTAP/chol LNPs were able to transfect pDNA and oligonucleotides, demonstrating the ability of these LNPs to transport the cargo into the cell nucleus.

In the first few months of the pandemic, several countries (such as China) prevented the spread of the pandemic successfully. By contrast, the pandemic in many other countries was not controlled well. For example, India encountered a second serious outbreak of COVID-19 from April 2021 due to the poor resistance measures implemented by the government. To figure out the effective countermeasures to the pandemic, this research proposes a COVID-19 pandemic and its response system, which consists of the infection subsystem, the quarantine subsystem, and the medical subsystem. On this basis, an improved SEIR-SD model is established which is utilized to analyze the response measures to the pandemic quantitatively. This model successfully simulates the actual epidemic scenarios in Wuhan, which verifies its effectiveness. Afterward, the impact of hospital administration rate, quarantine rate, average contact number, and contact infection rate on the cumulative number of infections and deaths are analyzed by simulation. The results show that both the medical and administrative efforts, especially in the early stage of the epidemic, are significant in reducing the number of infections and shortening the epidemic period. In the medical aspect, the more stringent quarantine brings the earlier inflection point of the epidemic;more importantly, improving the treatment rate significantly reduces the scale of the epidemic. In the administrative aspect, enforcing individual protection and strict community closure can effectively cut off the transmission of the virus and curb the spread of the epidemic. Finally, this research proposes several practical suggestions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main contribution of this research is that the effects of different response measures on the number of new infections daily and the cumulative number of deaths of a country or region in the COVID-19 pandemic are estimated quantitatively based on modeling and simulation.","output":"Quantitative Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic Responses Based on an Improved SEIR-SD Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Washing hands properly and frequently is the simplest and most cost-effective interventions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

However, the existing smartwatch based systems are not comprehensive enough in terms of achieving accuracy as well as reminding people to handwash and providing feedback to the user about the quality of handwashing. On-device processing is often required to provide real-time feedback to the user, and so it is important to develop a system that runs efficiently on low-resource devices like smartwatches. However, none of the existing systems for handwashing quality assessment are optimized for on-device processing. We present iWash, a comprehensive system for quality assessment and context-aware reminders for handwashing with real-time feedback using smartwatches. iWash is a hybrid deep neural network based system that is optimized for on-device processing to ensure high accuracy with minimal processing time and battery usage. Additionally, it is a context-aware system that detects when the user is entering home using a Bluetooth beacon and provides reminders to wash hands. iWash also offers touch-free interaction between the user and the smartwatch that minimizes the risk of germ transmission. We collected a real-life dataset and conducted extensive evaluations to demonstrate the performance of iWash.

Occupant expressions of thermal dissatisfaction and indoor environmental conditions were collected using densely-placed devices over a period of approximately 19 months. A logistic regression model was employed to identify the optimal settings, using regression coefficients that were estimated using Bayesian inference. A series of optimisation scenarios with and without considering the temporal variations of occupant thermal preferences and the spatial deviation of the indoor conditions was designed and implemented to evaluate their potential benefit in terms of overall occupant thermal dissatisfaction reduction. We developed two metrics that were tailored to quantify the overall reduction of thermal dissatisfaction when using optimal air temperature and PMV thermostat settings. These two metrics represented the average reduction of overall indoor thermal dissatisfaction each time a thermostat value was updated. The results showed that it was useful to consider the temporal variations of occupant thermal preferences to reduce the overall occupant thermal dissatisfaction in the office, and that using the same approach on individual zones within the open plan office would lead to further improvements. The case study demonstrated that the optimal adaptive temperature and PMV thermostat settings led to an overall thermal dissatisfaction reduction of 1.47% and 1.21% in the whole office, respectively (as opposed to 0.25% and 0.19% when single fixed temperature-based and PMV-based thermostat settings were used). By applying the proposed adaptive optimisation algorithm on individual zones in the office, the occupant thermal dissatisfaction reductions ranged from 0.88% to 5.17% for PMV-based settings, and from 1.20% to 5.19% for temperature-based settings.","output":"Development of a Bayesian based adaptive optimisation algorithm for the thermostat settings in agile open plan offices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to analyze the occurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders in patients with COVID-19 and to study the relationship of these disorders with organic damage to the central nervous system Material and methods An analysis of occurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders in patients with COVID-19 was carried out at the infectious hospital of the KBGMU for the period June-August 2020 Depression and anxiety were identified using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and compared with the MRI data of the brain Statistical data processing was carried out using Microsoft Excel 7 0 Results According to the analysis, out of 76 patients with COVID-19, depressive disorders were observed in 36 (46 3%) patients, anxiety disorders - subclinical anxiety in 16 (21 05%), clinical anxiety - in 19 (25%) The absence of depressive disorders was observed in 40 (52 63%), the absence of anxiety - in 41 (53 94%) By gender differentiation of patients, depressive disorders in men - 20 (46 5%), women - 16 (48 48%) Anxiety disorders: subclinical anxiety in men - 11 (25 5%), women - 5 (15 15 %), clinical anxiety in men - 7 (16 2%), women - 12 (36 36%) The average age of patients at the time of the study was 45 7 years When conducting MRI of brain, organic lesions were detected in 12 (16%) people, in 64 (84%) at the time of the study, organic lesions were not detected When collecting a follow-up in 31 patients, depressive disorders were noted in 8 (25 8%), subclinical anxiety - 2 (6 45%), clinical anxiety - 2 (6 45%), no anxiety - 27 (87 09%), no depression - 23 (74 19%) No organic lesions were found at the time of MRI of brain Conclusion When studying the occurrence of depressive and anxious states and their organic substrates, we found that there is no clear relationship between them and rather have a functional character ֧ݧ ߧѧ֧ԧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ - ѧߧѧݧڧ ӧ٧ߧڧܧߧӧ֧ߧڧ է֧֧ڧӧߧ  ֧ӧاߧ ѧۧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ  COVID-19  ڧ٧֧ߧڧ ӧ٧ѧڧާӧ٧ էѧߧߧ ߧѧ֧ߧڧ  ԧѧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ֧ ֧ߧѧݧߧ ߧ֧ӧߧ ڧ֧ާ ѧ֧ڧѧ  ާ֧է ӧ֧էק ѧߧѧݧڧ ӧ٧ߧڧܧߧӧ֧ߧڧ է֧֧ڧӧߧ  ֧ӧاߧ ѧۧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ  COVID-19 ߧ ҧѧ٧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧԧ ԧڧѧݧ ܧݧڧߧڧܧ ѧܧڧܧԧ ԧէѧӧ֧ߧߧԧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧԧ ߧڧӧ֧ڧ֧ ٧ ֧ڧ ڧߧ-ѧӧԧ 2020  ӧݧ֧ߧڧ է֧֧ڧӧߧԧ  ֧ӧاߧԧ ߧڧ ҧݧ ӧ֧է֧ߧ  ާ ڧѧݧߧ ܧѧݧ ֧ӧԧ  է֧֧ڧ (HADS)  ѧӧݧ֧ߧ  էѧߧߧާ ާѧԧߧڧߧ-֧٧ߧѧߧߧ ާԧѧڧ () ԧݧӧߧԧ ާ٧ԧ ѧڧڧ֧ܧѧ ҧѧҧܧ էѧߧߧ ӧ֧է֧ߧ  ڧݧ٧ӧѧߧڧ֧ Microsoft Excel 7,0 ֧٧ݧѧ  էѧߧߧ ӧ֧էקߧߧԧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ ڧ 76 ѧڧ֧ߧ  COVID-19 է֧֧ڧӧߧ ѧۧӧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧ  36 (46,3%) ѧڧ֧ߧ, ֧ӧاߧ ѧۧӧ  ӧڧէ ҧܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ֧ӧԧ -  16 (21,05%), ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧ ֧ӧԧ -  19 (25%) ӧڧ է֧֧ڧӧߧ ѧۧ ٧ѧ֧ԧڧڧӧѧߧ  40 (52,63%) ֧ݧӧ֧, ӧڧ ֧ӧԧ -  41 (53,94%)  ԧ֧ߧէ֧ߧ էڧ֧֧ߧڧӧܧ ѧڧ֧ߧ: է֧֧ڧӧߧ ѧۧӧ  ާاڧ - 20 (46,5%),  ا֧ߧڧ - 16 (48,48%) ֧ӧاߧ ѧۧӧ: ҧܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧѧ ֧ӧԧ  ާاڧ - 11 (25,5%),  ا֧ߧڧ - 5 (15,15%);ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧѧ ֧ӧԧ  ާاڧ - 7 (16,2%),  ا֧ߧڧ - 12 (36,36%) ֧էߧڧ ӧ٧ѧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ߧ ާާ֧ߧ ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ѧӧݧ 45,7 ԧէ  ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ  ԧݧӧߧԧ ާ٧ԧ ԧѧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ ҧݧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧ  12 (16%) ֧ݧӧ֧,  64 (84%) ߧ ާާ֧ߧ ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ԧѧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ ߧ ҧݧ  ҧ ܧѧѧާߧ֧٧ ڧ 31 ѧڧ֧ߧ է֧֧ڧӧߧ ѧۧӧ ާ֧֧ߧ  8 (25,8%), ҧܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧѧ ֧ӧԧ -  2 (6,45%), ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧѧ ֧ӧԧ -  2 (6,45%), ӧڧ ֧ӧԧ -  27 (87,09%), ߧ֧ է֧֧ڧ -  23 (74,19%)  ާާ֧ߧ ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ  ԧݧӧߧԧ ާ٧ԧ ԧѧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧا֧ߧڧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧ ߧ ҧݧ ӧ  ڧ٧֧ߧڧ ӧ٧ߧڧܧߧӧ֧ߧڧ է֧֧ڧӧߧ  ֧ӧاߧ ߧڧ  ڧ ԧѧߧڧ֧ܧԧ ҧѧ ߧѧާ ҧݧ ѧߧӧݧ֧ߧ,  קܧѧ ӧ٧ѧڧާӧ٧ ާ֧اէ ߧڧާ ӧ֧;ܧ֧  ߧڧ ڧާ֧ ߧܧڧߧѧݧߧ ѧѧܧ֧","output":"Incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between pandemic and human mobility has received considerable attention from scholars, as investigating such relationship can provide an indication of how human mobility changes in response to a public health crisis or whether reduced mobility contributes to preventing the spread of an infectious disease.

METHODS: This research was conducted as a cross-sectional and descriptive study. The questionnaires used in this study included demographic information to obtain the required information such as age, sex, clinical symptoms, underlying disease, type of drug used, smoking, occupation, hours of work, number of daily clients, use of mask or shield, type of working hours, weight and height and body mass index, number family, place of residence, role in the family, presence of an infected person in the family, communication with the suspect, observance or non-observance of health protocols.

In the literature, most cases demonstrate PTA following acute tonsillitis; however, less documented are cases arising in post-tonsillectomy patients. Here, we report a 45-year-old woman with a history of tonsillectomy 16 years prior, who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with PTA, including sore throat and the presence of a right-sided abscess in the posterolateral oropharynx with apparent pus. The patient reported three previous episodes of right-sided PTA, all of which were addressed via drainage and antibiotic treatment. This episode was treated similarly; cultures from the abscess revealed no growth of organisms. The patient was started on a short course of clindamycin and discharged to follow-up with her primary care physician. Several theories for the etiology of PTA development in post-tonsillectomy patients exist. One theory suggests that PTA may develop in this group of patients due to imperfect margins during the initial surgery, with residual tonsil tissue serving as a nidus for abscess development. Other theories suggest that a congenital fistula may exist in these patients, which, when occluded by scar tissue following a tonsillectomy, may lead to PTA development. Similarly, occlusion of minor salivary ducts has also been suggested to play a role in this unique pathophysiology. Overall, documenting rare cases of PTA development in post-tonsillectomy patients serves as a means of better understanding the complicated etiology behind PTA development and may be able to guide treatment in the future.","output":"Recurrent Peritonsillar Abscess in Post-tonsillectomy Patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Communication networks among professionals can be pathways for accelerating the diffusion of innovations if some local health departments (LHDs) drive the spread of knowledge. Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations.

This binding requires the RBD to undergo a conformational change from a closed to an open state. In the present study, a key pair of salt bridges formed by the side chains of K537 and E619, residues at the interfaces of SD1 and SD2, respectively, was identified to promote the opening of the RBD. Mutations of K537Q and E619D reduced their side chain lengths and eliminated this pair of salt bridges; as a result, the opening of the RBD was not observed in the MD simulations. Thus, blocking the formation of this pair of salt bridges is a promising approach for treating novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). FDA approved drug molecules were screened by their capabilities of blocking the formation of the key pair of salt bridges, achieved by their positional stabilities in the cavity containing the side chains of K537 and E619 formed in the interface between SD1 and SD2.

To prevent premature activation after biosynthesis, viral class I fusion proteins adopt a locked conformation and require proteolytic cleavage to render them fusion-ready.

Proteolytic processing of coronavirus spike (S) fusion proteins during virus entry has been suggested but not yet formally demonstrated, while the nature and functionality of the resulting subunit is still unclear. We used a prototype coronavirus--mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)--to develop a conditional biotinylation assay that enables the specific identification and biochemical characterization of viral S proteins on virions that mediated membrane fusion with the target cell. We demonstrate that MHV S proteins are indeed cleaved upon virus endocytosis, and we identify a novel processing product S2* with characteristics of a fusion-active subunit.

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

The main objective here is to define the prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a large monocentric retrospective study investigating all the ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS hospitalized at Valenciennes' general hospital, France, between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020. In the center a systematic IPA screening strategy was carried out for all ARDS patients, with weekly tests of serum galactomannan and beta-D-glucan. Bronchoalveolar lavage with culture and chest CT scan were performed when the serum assays were positives. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were studied. Their median age was 65 years, and 37 of the patients (71%) were male. Two patients had chronic immunosuppression and among all the patients, only 2 non-immunocompromised presented a putative IPA during their stay. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IPA in this cohort of COVID-19 patients (3.7%) is not higher than what is described in the other ARDS populations in the literature.

While a transmembrane proton electrical gradient established by a vacuolar-type ATPase powers vesicular glutamate transport, recent studies indicate that binding sites and flux properties for chloride, potassium, and protons within VGLUTs themselves regulate VGLUT activity as well. These intrinsic ionic binding and flux properties of VGLUTs can therefore be modulated by neurophysiological conditions to affect levels of glutamate available for release from synapses. Despite their extraordinary importance, specific and high-affinity pharmacological compounds that interact with these sites and regulate VGLUT function, distinguish between the various modes of transport, and the different isoforms themselves, are lacking.

Drug and antidrug antibody levels were measured using standard ELISAs. RESULTS: Therapeutic drug monitoring requests for adalimumab (96.5 [70.5 - 106] per week to 52 [33.5 - 57.0], p < 0.001) but not infliximab (184.5 [161.2 - 214.2] to 161 [135 - 197.5], p = 0.34) reduced during the first UK stay-at-home lockdown compared with the preceding six months. Fingerprick sampling was equivalent to conventional venepuncture for adalimumab (Figure 1), infliximab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab drug and anti-adalimumab and -infliximab antibody levels. The median (IQR) volume of serum obtained using intracapillary sampling was 195L (130C210). More than 87% (90/103) patients agreed that intracapillary testing was easy and 69% (71/103) preferred it to conventional venepuncture (Figure 2). In routine care, 75.3% (58/77) patients returned two blood samples within 14 days to permit remote assessment of biologic therapeutic drug monitoring.

Understanding PO could provide insight to \\"vitality of the profession\\" as defined in the Prioritized Research Agenda for the Athletic Training Profession. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to explore athletic trainers' (AT) PO over their employing organization and the athletic training profession. DESIGN Cross-Sectional Study Setting: Web-based survey Patients or Other Participants: Clinically practicing ATs that were active members of NATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Demographic variables, Psychological Ownership Questionnaire (POQ), and Psychological Ownership of Athletic Training (POQ-AT) were the primary outcomes measured. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic variables, POQ and POQ-AT overall scores, form scores, and dimension scores. Non-parametric tests were used to investigate differences between the POQ and POQ-AT among demographic characteristics. RESULTS ATs indicated greater PO over the athletic training profession (Z=-3.45, p=0.001) than over their employing organization. They indicated greater belongingness (Z=-9.51, p<0.001) and self-identity (Z=-8.71, p<0.001) and less territoriality (Z=-5.52, p<0.001) and accountability (Z=-5.33, p<0.001) over their profession than within their organization. ATs that supervised others indicated greater overall POQ (U=34372, p<0.001) and overall POQ-AT score (U=36624, p=0.014) than ATs that did not supervise others. There was a difference in overall POQ (H(4)=20.47, p<0.001) and overall POQ-AT scores (H(4)=21.34, p<0.001) between groupings of years of experience. CONCLUSIONS ATs indicate greater PO over their profession than their employing organizations. They indicate greater self-identity and belongingness and less territoriality and accountability over the athletic training profession than over their employing organization suggesting ATs are connecting aspirations and accomplishments with the profession but connecting duty and responsibility to their organizations.

The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcomes of both anastomotic techniques in robotic-assisted radical cystectomy. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with urinary bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy with urinary diversion and with ileo-ileal intestinal anastomosis at a single tertiary centre (2012-2018) was undertaken. The robotic operating time, hospital stay and GI complications were compared between the robotic-sewn (RS) and stapled anastomosis (SA) groups. The only difference between the groups was the anastomosis technique; the other technical steps during the operation were the same. Primary outcomes were GI complications; the secondary outcome was robotic operation time. RESULTS There were 155 patients, of which 112 (73%) were male. The median age was 71 years old. A surgical stapling device was used to create 66 (43%) separate anastomoses, while a robot-sewn method was employed in 89 (57%) anastomoses. There were no statistically significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between RS and SA.

An early severity risk stratification at hospital admission could help optimize ICU usage towards those more vulnerable and critically ill patients. MethodsOf 503 Spanish patients aged>64 years admitted in the ICU between 26 Feb and 02 Nov 2020 in two Spanish hospitals, we included 193 quality-controlled patients. The subphenotyping combined PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction methods to maximize non-linear correlation and reduce noise among age and full blood count tests (FBC) at hospital admission, followed by hierarchical clustering. FindingsWe identified five subphenotypes (Eld-ICU-COV19 clusters) with heterogeneous FBC patterns associated to significantly disparate 30-day ICU mortality rates ranging from 2% in a healthy cluster to 44% in a severe cluster, along three moderate clusters. InterpretationsTo our knowledge, this is the first study using age and FBC at hospital admission to early stratify the risk of death in ICU at 30 days in elderly patients. Our results provide guidance to comprehend the phenotypic classification and disparate severity patterns among elderly ICU patients with COVID-19, based only on age and FBC, that have the potential to establish target groups for early risk stratification or early triage systems to provide personalized treatments or aid the decision-making during resource allocation process for each target Eld-ICU-COV19 cluster, especially in those circumstances with resource scarcity problem.

A previous COVID-19 phenotyping study found three phenotypes from hospitalized patients associated with significantly disparate 30-day mortality rates (ranging from 2{middle dot}5 to 60{middle dot}7%). However, it seems to become harder to find phenotypes with discriminative mortality rates among ICU COVID-19 patients. For example, we found one study that uncovered two phenotypes from 39 ICU COVID-19 patients based on biomarkers with 39% and 63% mortality rates, but such difference was not statistically significant. We also found another study with more success that uncovered two ICU COVID-19 phenotypes using two different trajectories with somehow disparate 28-day mortality rates of 27% versus 37% (Ventilatory ratio trajectories) and of 25% versus 39% (mechanical power trajectories). Added value of this study To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses age and laboratory results at hospital admission (i.e., before ICU admission) in elderly patients to early stratify, prior ICU admission, the risk of death in ICU at 30 days. We classified 193 patients with COVID-19, based on age and ten Full Blood Count (FBC) tests, into five subphenotypes (one healthy, three moderate, and one severe) that showed significantly disparate 30-day ICU mortality rates from 2% to 44%. Implications of all the available evidence Identifying, from elderly ICU patients with COVID-19 (Eld-ICU-COV19), subphenotypes could spur further investigation to analyze the potential differences in their underlying disease mechanisms, acquire better phenotypical understanding among Eld-ICU-COV19 toward better decision-making in distributing the limited resources (including both logistic and medical) as well as shedding light on tailoring personalized treatment for each specific target subgroup in future medical research and clinical trial.

However, it remains unclear whether the combination of OK lens and 0.01% atropine has the potential to magnify the effectiveness of myopia control. The present study aims to compare the myopia control efficiency of the combination of OK lens and 0.01% atropine with the monotherapy of OK lens in children. METHODS: The present study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind and multicenter clinical trial. A total of 96 children within 8C12 years old were recruited. These participants are treated with the combination of OK lens and 0.01% atropine eyedrop or the combination of OK lens and placebo eyedrop. Each group includes 48 participants. The inclusion criteria are as follows: myopia between ? 1.00 and ? 4.00 D in either eye and astigmatism of no more than 1.50 D. The follow-up time points will be 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months from randomization. The primary outcome is determined by the difference in axial length of the two groups, between the baseline and 24 months from randomization.

We estimated the burden of community-onset RSV-associated hospitalizations among US children aged <2 years by extrapolating rates of RSV-confirmed hospitalizations in 4 surveillance states and using probabilistic multipliers to adjust for ascertainment biases. METHODS: From October 2014 through April 2015, clinician-ordered RSV tests identified laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalizations among children aged <2 years at 4 influenza hospitalization surveillance network sites. Surveillance populations were used to estimate age-specific rates of RSV-associated hospitalization, after adjusting for detection probabilities. We extrapolated these rates using US census data. RESULTS: We identified 1554 RSV-associated hospitalizations in children aged <2 years. Of these, 27% were admitted to an intensive care unit, 6% needed mechanical ventilation, and 5 died. Most cases (1047/1554; 67%) had no underlying condition. Adjusted age-specific RSV hospitalization rates per 100 000 population were 1970 (95% confidence interval [CI],1787 to 2177), 897 (95% CI, 761 to 1073), 531 (95% CI, 459 to 624), and 358 (95% CI, 317 to 405) for ages 0C2, 3C5, 6C11, and 12C23 months, respectively. Extrapolating to the US population, an estimated 49 509C59 867 community-onset RSV-associated hospitalizations among children aged <2 years occurred during the 2014C2015 season.

METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a sample of 1,543 unvaccinated Austrian residents in October 2021, including two embedded conjoint experiments. FINDINGS: We screened 8,190 individuals to recruit the sample matching the Austrian micro-census. In experiment 1, easing rather than tightening of societal restrictions, a fixed monetary reward compared to a lottery and physicians recommendations were associated with significantly higher intentions to get vaccinated. In experiment 2, standard approval by European or national authorities and simple information had a significant positive effect on vaccination propensity. Among the unvaccinated, fear of side effects, beliefs that comorbidities or the desire to have children would not allow vaccination, the assumption that the own immune system would provide sufficient protection, conspirational thinking (e.g., the refusal to participate in a large genetic experiment), low trust in societal institutions, and spiritual beliefs were very common. INTERPRETATION: While many unvaccinated showed a low propensity to become vaccinated, we identified a cluster of 195 (23% of the participants without missing values) that could potentially be reached by information and incentives, including people with heightened comorbidity rates or a desire for children.

Due to a founder effect, Ashkenazi Jewish individuals are at higher risk for carrying three specific BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants. There have been recent calls for population screening in this population because many carriers do not have family histories suggestive of hereditary cancer. One approach could be to integrate optional BRCA1/2 testing into routinely offered reproductive carrier screening for recessive and X-linked disorders. However, the differing goals of these types of testing (i.e., personal health risks versus family planning) raise questions about the implications for patient education and informed consent. To this end, we aimed to determine interest, attitudes, and preferences regarding integrating such testing by electronically surveying 331 Ashkenazi Jewish participants in JScreen  a national, not-for-profit, at-home carrier screening program focused on genetic risks in Jewish communities. We found that while 41% of participants had plans to pursue BRCA1/2 testing, 93% would have opted for such testing if offered as an add-on to reproductive carrier screening. This was particularly true of those with higher perceived cancer risk and more positive attitudes toward genetic testing. With respect to preferences about delivery of this service, more than 85% of participants preferred remote (telephone, print, or web-based) genetic education rather than traditional genetic counseling. These results suggest that offering optional BRCA1/2 testing within the context of reproductive carrier screening might provide opportunities for cancer prevention without overburdening scarce genetic counseling resources.

Due to the heterogenous distribution of population and public facilities, and the structural heterogeneity of human mobility network embedded in space, infectious diseases break out at different locations would cause different transmission risk and control difficulty. This study aims to investigate the impact of initial outbreak locations on the risk of spatiotemporal transmission and reveal the driving force behind high-risk outbreak locations. First, integrating mobile phone location data, we built a SLIR (susceptible-latent-infectious-removed)-based meta-population model to simulate the spreading process of an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19) across fine-grained intra-urban regions (i.e., 649 communities of Shenzhen City, China). Based on the simulation model, we evaluated the transmission risk caused by different initial outbreak locations by proposing three indexes including the number of infected cases (CaseNum), the number of affected regions (RegionNum), and the spatial diffusion range (SpatialRange). Finally, we investigated the contribution of different influential factors to the transmission risk via machine learning models. Results indicates that different initial outbreak locations would cause similar CaseNum but different RegionNum and SpatialRange. To avoid the epidemic spread quickly to more regions, it is necessary to prevent epidemic breaking out in locations with high population-mobility flow density. While to avoid epidemic spread to larger spatial range, remote regions with long daily trip distance of residents need attention. Those findings can help understand the transmission risk and driving force of initial outbreak locations within cities and make precise prevention and control strategies in advance.","output":"Impact of initial outbreak locations on transmission risk of infectious diseases in an intra-urban area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cabazitaxel has been applied to the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but the molecular mechanism remained to be fully understood. METHODS After treatment with Cabazitaxel alone or in combination with ionizing radiation (IR), CRPC cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis were determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation, and flow cytometry, respectively. Tumor volume was measured after the establishment of animal xenograft model. Relative expressions of proteins related to apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and cleaved caspase 3) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway were measured by Western blot, and the phosphorylated-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT ratios were determined as well. RESULTS Cell viability and proliferation were suppressed, and apoptosis was promoted in CRPC cells after Cabazitaxel treatment alone, accompanied with upregulated expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 and downregulated Bcl-2 expression. Also, a single treatment with Cabazitaxel resulted in suppression of PI3K/AKT pathway activation, along with downregulated expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT and a reduced ratio of p-PI3K/PI3K to p-AKT/AKT. Meanwhile, Cabazitaxel enhanced the effects of IR on suppressing survival and promoting apoptosis in CRPC cells through downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax and cleaved caspase 3. However, Cabazitaxel suppressed IR-induced PI3K/AKT pathway activation via downregulating p-PI3K and p-AKT, leading to a reduced ratio of p-PI3K/PI3K to p-AKT/AKT. Furthermore, Cabazitaxel further promoted the effects of IR on suppressing tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSION Cabazitaxel inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis and radiosensitivity of CRPC cells, which is related to the suppression of PI3K/AKT pathway, providing a therapeutic method for CRPC in clinical practice.","output":"Cabazitaxel suppresses the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis and radiosensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adipose cell-free derivatives have been recently gaining attention as potential therapeutic agents for various human diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To assess overall patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits and explore whether satisfaction varied by contact method (phone or video) and encounter type (new problem, worsening problem, stable/improving problem). DESIGN: Prospective survey study. SETTING: Cancer rehabilitation program at an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Three cancer rehabilitation providers and 155 unique patients participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Provider and patient satisfaction measured by customized surveys. RESULTS: One hundred eighty\\\\four encounters with 169 unique patients were scheduled. Of these, 14 were new visits and 170 were follow\\\\up visits. Eighteen encounters (9.8%) were either no shows or rescheduled, making for 166 encounters with 155 unique patients. Patient and provider responses comprised the following: 94.8% of patient responses reported quite a bit or very much for the telemedicine visit being a good experience; 63.1% of patient responses reported quite a bit or very much for interest in using telemedicine visits in the future; and 83.9% of provider responses reported quite a bit or very much for the patient's main problem being addressed by the visit. Providers were more likely to prefer an in\\\\person visit for a new or worsening problem versus a stable/improving problem. The most common services provided were medication prescription/titration and education/counseling. The least common services provided were making of new diagnoses, ordering interventional procedures, and making referrals. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits were well received by both patients and providers in a cancer rehabilitation medicine clinic setting.

This article discusses considerations for the ED and trauma wards to help to maintain the safety of patients and healthcare providers with an emphasis on more remote geography. Methods: The study was conducted from 23 March 2020 to 5 May 2020 during the full lockdown period (2020 group) and compared to the same time frame in 2019 (2019 group). Included are all patients who attended the ED at Raigmore Hospital during this period from both the local area and tertiary referral from throughout the UK Highlands. Data was collected and analyzed through the ED Information System (EDIS) as well as ward and theatre records. Results: A total of 1,978 patients presented to the ED during the lockdown period, compared to 4,777 patients in the same timeframe in 2019; a reduction of 58.6%. Orthopaedic presentations in 2020 and 2019 were 736 (37.2%) and 1,729 (36.2%) respectively, representing a 57.4% reduction. During the lockdown, 43.6% of operations were major procedures (n = 48) and 56.4% were minor procedures (n = 62), representing a significant proportional shift. Conclusion: During the COVID- 19 lockdown period there was a significant reduction in ED attendances and orthopaedic presentations compared to 2019. We also observed that there was a proportional increase in fractures in elderly patients and in minor injuries requiring surgery. These represented the majority of the orthopaedic workload during the lockdown period of 2020.

Rainwater harvesting systems and green roofs are recognized as being among the most effective blue-green mitigation measures. However, performances of these systems have currently been investigated only at laboratory or very-small local scales. In this work, we assess the potential benefit of the extensive installation of these solutions on all the rooftops of 9 cities, with different climatological and geographical characteristics. Both surface discharge reduction and delay between rainfall and runoff peak generation have been investigated. Green roofs ensure a larger average lag time between rainfall and runoff peaks than rainwater harvesting systems, without significant differences between intensive and extensive structures. On the other hand, the cost-efficiency analysis, considering the entire urban area, shows a higher retention capacity with a lower financial investment for rainwater harvesting rather than for green roofs in most cases. For extreme rainfall events, large-scale installation of rainwater harvesting systems coupled with intensive green roofs over the entire city have shown to be the most efficient solution, with a total discharge reduction that can vary from 5% to 15%, depending on the city characteristics and local climate.","output":"Comparison of blue-green solutions for urban flood mitigation: A multi-city large-scale analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the age of network, network culture is gestated, and the emergence of security issues makes the governance of network culture put on the agenda.

BACKGROUND Few studies have evaluated sex-related benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Moreover, data on sex-related differences in the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in this population are limited. METHODS A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 460 patients (355 male subjects and 105 female subjects) from the UMBRELLA (Incidence of Arrhythmia in Spanish Population With a Medtronic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Implant) national registry. Patients were followed up through remote monitoring after the first implantation of a CRT-D during a median follow-up of 2.2  1.0 years. Sex differences were analyzed in terms of ventricular arrhythmia-treated incidence and death during the follow-up period, with a particular focus on primary prevention patients. RESULTS Baseline New York Heart Association functional class was worse in women compared with that in men (67.0% of women in New York Heart Association functional class III vs. 49.7% of men; p = 0.003), whereas women had less ischemic cardiac disease (20.8% vs. 41.7%; p < 0.001). Female sex was an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias (hazard ratio: 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 0.86; p = 0.020), as well as left ventricular ejection fraction and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Mortality in women was one-half that of men, although events were scarce and without significant differences (2.9% vs. 5.6%; p = 0.25).

LncRNAs mostly exert their functions by regulating the expressions of target genes, and accurate prediction of potential lncRNA target genes would be helpful to further understanding the functional annotations of lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in traditional computational methods for predicting lncRNA target genes, a novel model which was named Weighted Average Fusion Network Representation learning for predicting LncRNA Target Genes (WAFNRLTG) was proposed. First, a novel heterogeneous network was constructed by integrating lncRNA sequence similarity network, mRNA sequence similarity network, lncRNA-mRNA interaction network, lncRNA-miRNA interaction network and mRNA-miRNA interaction network. Next, four popular network representation learning methods were utilized to gain the representation vectors of lncRNA and mRNA nodes. Then, the representations of lncRNAs and target genes in the heterogeneous network were obtained with the weighted average fusion network representation learning method. Finally, we merged the representations of lncRNAs and related target genes to form lncRNA-gene pairs, trained the XGBoost classifier and predicted potential lncRNA target genes. In five-cross validations on the training and independent datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that WAFNRLTG obtained better AUC scores (0.9410, 0.9350) and AUPR scores (0.9391, 0.9350).

It is important to study their role in the management of the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in cities, as certain variables like the number of tests and the access to health system cannot be assumed as equal. The aim of this work was to determine the relation of social determinants in the incidence of Covid-19 in the city of Barcelona. METHODS An observational retrospective ecological study was performed, with the neighbourhood as the population unit, based on data of cumulative incidence published at May 14th, 2020 by the Public Health Agency of Barcelona. Covid-19 incidence disparities depending on the income of the neighbourhoods, the Pearson linear correlation of the variables selected (age, sex, net density, immigrants, comorbidities, smokers, Body Mass Index [BMI] and Available Income per Family Index [AIFI]) with the incidence and the correlation with a multivariant Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were estimated. RESULTS It was found that neighbourhoods belonging to the lowest quintile of income had a 42% more incidence than those belonging to the highest quintile: 942 cases per 100,000 inhabitants versus 545 per 100,000 inhabitants of the highest quintile. The Pearson correlation was statistically significative between the incidence of Covid-19 and the percentage of population over 75 (r=0.487), the percentage of immigration of the neighbourhood and the origin of the immigrants (r=-0.257), the AIFI (r=-0.462), the percentage of smokers (r=0.243) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (r=0.483). The GLM showed that the most correlated variables with the incidence are the percentage of people over 75 (Z-score=0.258), the percentage of people from Maghreb (Z-score=-0.206) and Latin America (Z-score=0.19) and the percentage of people with BMI over 25 (Z-score=0.334).

Flavonoids are valuable compounds present in plants, fruits, grains, roots, stems, tea, and wine, among others; they possess many benefits for health due to their antioxidant properties toward reactive oxygen species, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative, among others. These characteristics make flavonoids attractive in various industrial areas such as medicine, nutraceutical, cosmetology, and pharmaceutical. Unfortunately, flavonoids lack long-term stability, are sensitive to light, long periods of darkness with low oxygen concentration, and often present a low water solubility and poor bioavailability.

With the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several concerns have been raised regarding the ability of medical systems to handle sudden changes in the daily routines of healthcare providers. One significant problem is the management of ambulance dispatch and control during a pandemic. To help address this problem, we first analyze ambulance dispatch data records from April 2014 to August 2020 for Nagoya City, Japan.

An important step in the biofunctionalization, namely, the formation of Au-plated clusters on the sensor strips, was verified by scanning electron microscopy, as well as electrical measurements, to confirm successful binding of thiol groups on this Au surface. The functionalized sensor was externally connected to the gate electrode of the MOSFET, and synchronous pulses were applied to both the sensing strip and the drain contact of the MOSFET. The resulting changes in the dynamics of drain waveforms were converted into analog voltages and digital readouts, which correlate with the concentration of proteins and virus present in the tested solution. A broad range of protein concentrations from 1 fg/ml to 10 g/ml and virus concentrations from 100 to 2500 PFU/ml were detectable for the sensor functionalized with both antibodies.

Recent studies have investigated the effect of deep learning-based assistive technology on CR interpretation (DLCR), although its relevance to ED physicians remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether DLCR supports CR interpretation and the clinical decision-making of ED physicians. METHODS: We conducted a prospective interventional study using a web-based performance assessment system. Study participants were recruited through the official notice targeting board for certified emergency physicians and residents working at the present ED. Of the eight ED physicians who volunteered to participate in the study, seven ED physicians were included, while one participant declared withdrawal during performance assessment. Seven physicians CR interpretations and clinical decision-making were assessed based on the clinical data from 388 patients, including detecting the target lesion with DLCR. Participant performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy analyses; decision-making consistency was measured by kappa statistics. ED physicians with < 24 months of experience were defined as inexperienced. RESULTS: Among the 388 simulated cases, 259 (66.8%) had CR abnormality. Their median value of abnormality score measured by DLCR was 59.3 (31.77, 76.25) compared to a score of 3.35 (1.57, 8.89) for cases of normal CR. There was a difference in performance between ED physicians working with and without DLCR (AUROC: 0.801, P < 0.001). The diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of CR were higher for all ED physicians working with DLCR than for those working without it. The overall kappa value for decision-making consistency was 0.902 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.884C0.920); concurrently, the kappa value for the experienced group was 0.956 (95% CI 0.934C0.979), and that for the inexperienced group was 0.862 (95% CI 0.835C0.889). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary evidence that ED physicians using DLCR in a clinical setting perform better at CR interpretation than their counterparts who do not use this technology. DLCR use influenced the clinical decision-making of inexperienced physicians more strongly than that of experienced physicians.

We also examined the use of Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) alongside the presenting complaints in triaging/prioritising patients for further imaging and/or endoscopic investigations appropriately. METHODS: A list of all patients referred via the two-week pathway to the West Suffolk Hospital for suspected colorectal cancers from 30/01/2020 to 19/07/2020 was compiled. The main four red flag symptoms were change in bowel habit (CIBH), anorectal bleeding, anaemia and weight loss. A subset of 235 patients were closely examined regarding their presenting complaints, FIT, imaging and endoscopy results with analysis of outcomes. RESULTS: 127 male versus 108 female patients were included. 59.61% of patients who were eligible for the FIT test received one. Mean waiting time for FIT positive patients was 42.39 (95% CI) versus 61.10 (95% CI) for FIT negative patients. Patients with one or two red flags symptoms had a mean waiting time of 44.81 days (95% CI 35.79-53.82) and 47.91 days (95% CI 38.07-57.75) respectively. Patients with three red flag symptoms had a mean waiting time of 28.2 days (95% CI 17.94-38.39). There was a statistically significant difference in mean waiting time between patients having 1-2 symptoms and patients with three symptoms (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite delays during the COVID pandemic particularly for endoscopy, high risk and FIT positive patients were prioritised. Waiting times were still higher than advised national guidelines.","output":"EP.WE.844 Two-week bowel cancer referrals during the COVID pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Study of the medico economic impact of enhanced rehabilitation after surgery (ERAS), by comparing the cost of patient care with or without ERAS, both from the point of view of the hospitals and the Social Security Health Insurance Program. METHODS Retrospective longitudinal study on matched data from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The data are extracted from the French prospective payment system. We studied 12 of the most commonly performed in ERAS business segments. The primary outcome was the reduction of the average length of hospital stay and its implications on production costs and excess capacity. We also studied the impact on hospital incomes and Social Security Insurance Program expenses. The potential gain in hospital days was computed by comparing the length of stay of ERAS and non-ERAS cases. The cost reduction was estimated using the mean number of avoidable days of hospitalization, and the mean cost of the stays obtained from the national cost study. Finally, we studied an approximation of the additional expense for the Social Security Health Insurance Program on costs standardized by applying public sector rates. RESULTS The average length of stay reduction attributed to ERAS is 1.45 (CI 95% 1.42 to 1.48) day per stay, translating to a cost reduction for the hospitals of  1060 (CI 95% 995 to 1125) per patient and a total of 65 million (CI 95% 61 to 69). At the same time, the additional expenses for the Social Security Insurance Program can conservatively be approximated to  1.6 million, breaking into a  2.2 million increase partially compensated by cost savings of  0.6 million over subsequent stays for complications. Overall, for each percent of additional ERAS activity over the scope of the study, the marginal cost reduction for the hospitals can be estimated to  1.8 million (CI 95% 1.7 million to 2.0 million). CONCLUSIONS Associated with previously known clinical benefits for the patients, these convincing results in terms of economic gain strongly support expanding the adoption of ERAS.","output":"Medico-economic impact of enhanced rehabilitation after surgery: an exhaustive, nation-wide claims study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most widely used materials in three-dimensional (3D) printing technology due to its multiple advantages such as biocompatibility and biodegradable. However, there is still a lack of study on 3D printing PLA for use as a denture base material. The goal of this study was to compare 3D printing PLA to traditional poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a denture basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The PMMA (M) and PLA (L) specimens were fabricated by compression molding, and fuse deposition modeling technique, respectively. Each specimen group was divided into three different temperature groups of 25C (25), 37C (37), and 55C (55). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of raw materials and specimen was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The heat deflection temperature (HDT) of each material was also observed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data of flexural strength and flexural modulus were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, and Tukey honestly significant difference. The Tg and HDT data, on the other hand, were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS The results showed that PLA had lower flexural strength than PMMA in all temperature conditions, while the PMMA 25C (M25) and PMMA 37C (M37) obtained the highest mean values. PLA 25C (L25) and PLA 37C (L37) had significant higher flexural modulus than the other groups. However, the flexural properties of L55 could not be observed, which may be explained by Tg and HDT of PLA. CONCLUSION PLA only meets the flexural modulus requirement, although it was greater than flexural modulus of PMMA. On the other hand, PMMA can meet both good flexural strength and modulus requirement. However, increase in temperature could reduce flexural strength and flexural modulus of PMMA and PLA.","output":"Thermal Change Affects Flexural and Thermal Properties of Fused Deposition Modeling Poly(Lactic Acid) and Compression Molding Poly(Methyl Methacrylate)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic feelings of emptiness is an under-researched symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD), despite indications it may be central to the conceptualisation, course, and outcome of BPD treatment. This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of chronic feelings of emptiness in BPD, identify key findings, and clarify differences between chronic feelings of emptiness and related constructs like depression, hopelessness, and loneliness. METHOD: A PRISMA guided systematic search of the literature identified empirical studies with a focus on BPD or BPD symptoms that discussed chronic feelings of emptiness or a related construct. RESULTS: Ninety-nine studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Key findings identified there were significant difficulties in defining and measuring chronic emptiness. However, based on the studies reviewed, chronic emptiness is a sense of disconnection from both self and others. When experienced at frequent and severe levels, it is associated with low remission for people with BPD. Emptiness as a construct can be separated from hopelessness, loneliness and intolerance of aloneness, however more research is needed to explicitly investigate these experiences. Chronic emptiness may be related to depressive experiences unique to people with BPD, and was associated with self-harm, suicidality, and lower social and vocational function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that understanding chronic feelings of emptiness is central to the experience of people with BPD and treatment focusing on connecting with self and others may help alleviate a sense of emptiness. Further research is required to provide a better understanding of the nature of chronic emptiness in BPD in order to develop ways to quantify the experience and target treatment.

Genome plasticity has given rise to a wide range of strain variation with respect to antimicrobial resistance profiles and expression of virulence factors which lead to altered phenotypes associated with pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical strains of A. baumannii for phenotypic variation that might correlate with virulence phenotypes, antimicrobial resistance patterns, or strain isolation source. We hypothesized that individual strain virulence phenotypes might be associated with anatomical site of isolation or alterations in susceptibility to antimicrobial interventions. METHODOLOGY: A cohort of 17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii isolated from diverse anatomical sites were evaluated to ascertain phenotypic patterns including biofilm formation, hemolysis, motility, and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility/resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin- K clavulanate, tetracyclin, and tobramycin was determined. RESULTS: Antibiotic resistance was prevalent in many strains including resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, amikacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, piperacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin- K clavulanate, tetracyclin, and tobramycin. All strains tested induced hemolysis on agar plate detection assays. Wound-isolated strains of A. baumannii exhibited higher motility than strains isolated from blood, urine or Foley catheter, or sputum/bronchial wash. A. baumannii strains isolated from patient blood samples formed significantly more biofilm than isolates from wounds, sputum or bronchial wash samples. An inverse relationship between motility and biofilm formation was observed in the cohort of 17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii tested in this study. Motility was also inversely correlated with induction of hemolysis. An inverse correlation was observed between hemolysis and resistance to ticarcillin-k clavulanate, meropenem, and piperacillin. An inverse correlation was also observed between motility and resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone, ceftoxamine, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Strain dependent variations in biofilm and motility are associated with anatomical site of isolation. Biofilm and hemolysis production both have an inverse association with motility in the cohort of strains utilized in this study, and motility and hemolysis were inversely correlated with resistance to numerous antibiotics.

We sought to investigate whether carotid stiffness, carotid intimaCmedia thickness and the aortic augmentation index are altered in young adults 3C4 weeks after contraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) compared with young healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and the aortic augmentation index were greater in young adults who tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 compared with healthy young adults. These findings provide additional evidence for detrimental effects of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on young adult vasculature, which might have implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: Contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) has been observed to cause decrements in vascular function of young adults. However, less is known about the impact of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on arterial stiffness and structure, which might have additional implications for cardiovascular health. The purpose of this study was to assess the carotid artery stiffness and structure using ultrasound and the aortic augmentation index (AIx) using applanation tonometry in young adults after they tested positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. We hypothesized that carotid artery stiffness, carotid intimaCmedia thickness (cIMT) and aortic AIx would be elevated in young adults with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 compared with healthy young adults. We evaluated 15 young adults (six male and nine female; 20  1 years of age; body mass index, 24  3 kg m(?2)) 3C4 weeks after a positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test result compared with young healthy adults (five male and 10 female; 23  1 years of age; body mass index, 22  2 kg m(?2)) who were evaluated before the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and cIMT were assessed using ultrasound, whereas aortic AIx and aortic AIx standardized to 75 beats min(?1) (AIx@HR75) were assessed from carotid pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor. Group differences were observed for carotid stiffness (control, 5  1 m s(?1); SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 6  1 m s(?1)), Young's modulus (control, 396  120 kPa; SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 576  224 kPa), aortic AIx (control, 3  13%; SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 13  9%) and aortic AIx@HR75 (control, ?3  16%; SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, 10  7%; P < 0.05).

This study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccinations by country, antigen, and sector (public or private), up to 1 June 2020, and to identify the reasons for disruption and possible solutions. METHODS: Sanofi Pasteur teams from 19 countries in SEAR/WPR completed a structured questionnaire reporting on COVID-19 disruptions for 13C19 routinely delivered antigens per country, based on sales data, government reports, and regular physician interactions. Data were analysed descriptively, disruption causes ranked, and solutions evaluated using a modified public health best practices framework. FINDINGS: 95% (18/19) of countries reported vaccination disruption. When stratified by country, a median of 91% (interquartile range 77C94) of antigens were impacted. Infancy and school-entry age vaccinations were most impacted. Both public and private sector healthcare providers experienced disruptions. Vaccination rates had not recovered for 39% of impacted antigens by 1 June 2020. Fear of infection, movement/travel restrictions, and limited healthcare access were the highest-ranked reasons for disruption. Highest-scoring solutions were separating vaccination groups from unwell patients, non-traditional vaccination venues, virtual engagement, and social media campaigns. Many of these solutions were under-utilised. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-induced disruption of routine vaccination was more widespread than previously reported. Adaptable solutions were identified which could be implemented in SEAR/WPR and elsewhere. Governments and private providers need to act urgently to improve coverage rates and plan for future waves of the pandemic, to avoid a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Decades of theoretical and experimental data suggest that nonspecific effects of nonCCOVID-19 vaccines may help bolster population immunological resilience to new pathogens. These routine vaccinations can stimulate heterologous cross-protective effects, which modulate nontargeted infections. For example, immunization with Bacillus CalmetteCGurin, inactivated influenza vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and other vaccines have been associated with some protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and amelioration of COVID-19 disease. If heterologous vaccine interventions (HVIs) are to be seriously considered by policy makers as bridging or boosting interventions in pandemic settings to augment nonpharmaceutical interventions and specific vaccination efforts, evidence is needed to determine their optimal implementation. Using the COVID-19 International Modeling Consortium mathematical model, we show that logistically realistic HVIs with low (5 to 15%) effectiveness could have reduced COVID-19 cases, hospitalization, and mortality in the United States fall/winter 2020 wave. Similar to other mass drug administration campaigns (e.g., for malaria), HVI impact is highly dependent on both age targeting and intervention timing in relation to incidence, with maximal benefit accruing from implementation across the widest age cohort when the pandemic reproduction number is >1.0. Optimal HVI logistics therefore differ from optimal rollout parameters for specific COVID-19 immunizations. These results may be generalizable beyond COVID-19 and the US to indicate how even minimally effective heterologous immunization campaigns could reduce the burden of future viral pandemics.","output":"Heterologous vaccination interventions to reduce pandemic morbidity and mortality: Modeling the US winter 2020 COVID-19 wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The education sector in Bangladesh has been affected severely by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis like many other countries around the globe.

Among nosocomial pneumonia subtypes, ventilated HABP (vHABP) is associated with the lowest survival. In the ASPECT-NP randomized, controlled trial, participants with vHABP treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam had lower 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM) than those receiving meropenem. We conducted a series of post hoc analyses to explore the clinical significance of this finding. METHODS: ASPECT-NP was a multinational, phase 3, noninferiority trial comparing ceftolozane/tazobactam with meropenem for treating vHABP and VABP; study design, efficacy, and safety results have been reported previously. The primary endpoint was 28-day ACM. The key secondary endpoint was clinical response at test-of-cure. Participants with vHABP were a prospectively defined subgroup, but subgroup analyses were not powered for noninferiority testing. We compared baseline and treatment factors, efficacy, and safety between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in participants with vHABP. We also conducted a retrospective multivariable logistic regression analysis in this subgroup to determine the impact of treatment arm on mortality when adjusted for significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: Overall, 99 participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and 108 in the meropenem arm had vHABP. 28-day ACM was 24.2% and 37.0%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference: 0.2, 24.8) and 18.2% and 36.6%, respectively, in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population (95% CI 2.5, 32.5). Clinical cure rates in the intention-to-treat population were 50.5% and 44.4%, respectively (95% CI ? 7.4, 19.3). Baseline clinical, baseline microbiologic, and treatment factors were comparable between treatment arms. Multivariable regression identified concomitant vasopressor use and baseline bacteremia as significantly impacting ACM in ASPECT-NP; adjusting for these two factors, the odds of dying by day 28 were 2.3-fold greater when participants received meropenem instead of ceftolozane/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: There were no underlying differences between treatment arms expected to have biased the observed survival advantage with ceftolozane/tazobactam in the vHABP subgroup. After adjusting for clinically relevant factors found to impact ACM significantly in this trial, the mortality risk in participants with vHABP was over twice as high when treated with meropenem compared with ceftolozane/tazobactam.

APOBEC family expansion has been documented among mammalian species, suggesting a powerful selection for their activity. Enzymes with a duplicated zinc-binding domain often have catalytically active and inactive domains, yet both have antiviral function. Although APOBEC antiviral function was discovered through hypermutation of HIV-1 genomes lacking an active Vif protein, much evidence indicates that APOBECs also inhibit virus replication through mechanisms other than mutagenesis. Multiple steps of the viral replication cycle may be affected, although nucleic acid replication is a primary target. Packaging of APOBECs into virions was first noted with HIV-1, yet is not a prerequisite for viral inhibition. APOBEC antagonism may occur in viral producer and recipient cells. Signatures of APOBEC activity include G-to-A and C-to-T mutations in a particular sequence context. The importance of APOBEC activity for viral inhibition is reflected in the identification of numerous viral factors, including HIV-1 Vif, which are dedicated to antagonism of these deaminases. Such viral antagonists often are only partially successful, leading to APOBEC selection for viral variants that enhance replication or avoid immune elimination.","output":"The Role of APOBECs in Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid transmission tendency, severity, and wide geographical spread of newly emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in different environmental matrices, including water, air, and soil, has posed severe health, environmental, energy, and economic challenges worldwide.

Oligonu-cleotide pair UTR1 - UTR2 +, corresponding to sequences within the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the genome, also gave the predicted product with all the isolates. Oligonucleotide pair UTR3 - /UTR4 + was internal to oligonucleotides UTR1 - /UTR2 + and was used in a nested-set arrangement for greater specificity and sensitivity, giving the correct product with the 39 isolates examined. Oligonucleotide pair S1Unil - /S1Uni2 + was used to produce a 1.6 kb cDNA, corresponding to most of the S1 region of the S gene, with 24/24 isolates tested. This oligonucleotide pair was less suited than the others for routine detection of IBV but is recommended for the amplification of the S1 region of the S gene of new isolates for subsequent analysis. Other oligonucleotide pairs, yielding cDNA corresponding to the variable region of the IBV genome where genes 3 and 4 (M) overlap, were selected to be largely specific for Massachusetts serotype isolates, in the context of European strains. RT-PCR analysis using these oligonucleotide pairs showed that a number of field isolate preparations also contained a small amount of Massachusetts serotype virus, probably of vaccine origin and indicative of low level persistent infection.

The degradation of both proteins is ubiquitin dependent. RNF152 is a transmembrane E3 ligase that ubiquitinates itself, whereas LAPTM4A uses its carboxyl-terminal PY motifs to recruit NEDD4-1 for ubiquitination. After ubiquitination, they are internalized into the lysosome lumen by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery for degradation. Strikingly, when ectopically expressed in budding yeast, human RNF152 is still degraded by the vacuole (yeast lysosome) in an ESCRT-dependent manner.

This study aimed to predict HUA by determining the relationship between the baseline FLI and HUA events and by validating the FLICHUA correlation through follow-up. METHODS: This study was a community-based cohort study involving 8851 adults in China. We performed anthropometric assessments and analyzed baseline and follow-up blood samples. HUA was defined as a uric acid level of > 420 mol/L (7 mg/dL). RESULTS: Patients with HUA had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, lipid metabolism disorders, and hypertension and higher FLI values than those with normal uric acid levels (P < 0.001). Serum uric acid was positively correlated with the FLI (r = 0.41, P < 0.001); the diagnostic cut-off value of FLI for the diagnosis of HUA was 27.15, with a specificity of 70.9% and sensitivity of 79.6%. FLI was an independent risk factor for HUA, with a 1.72-, 2.74-, and 4.80-fold increase in the risk of developing HUA with increasing FLI quartile levels compared with the FLI at quartile level 1 (P < 0.001).

This observational, descriptive study includes all patients that required veno-venous (V-V) ECMO and transport by a mobile team between October 2009 and May 2020. Linear and multiple logistic regressions were applied to explore the risk factors for mortality in the ICU. Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated to predict the survival in patients transported by helicopter or ambulance, and the two cohorts were compared according to their baseline characteristics. Of 122 patients transported, 89 (73%) survived to ICU discharge (50 (41%) patients were transported by ambulance, and 72 (59%) were transported by helicopter). Independent predictive factors associated with mortality in a stepwise multiple regression model were prone positioning, acute kidney injury, and the number of days spent on mechanical ventilation (MV). Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival favored the helicopter cohort (79%) rather than the ambulance cohort (64%). Patients transported by helicopter had better pre-ECMO profiles, with shorter hospital and ICU stays, a shorter duration of MV use, and higher RESP scores, which indicate better survival probabilities. ECMO transport can be carried out safely over long distances; in rural areas with underdeveloped roads, transportation via helicopter or ambulance can extend the arm of the hospital to remote areas.

Our institution is a regional trauma and emergency center in the northern Gyeonggi Province. The changing trend of patient care in the emergency room of this hospital likely reflects the overall trend of patients in the area. In the present study, whether changes in the surrounding social environment following the outbreak of COVID-19 changed the incidence of neurosurgical emergency patients and whether differences in practice existed were investigated. METHODS: The overall trend was analyzed from January 2020 which is before the outbreak of COVID-19 to September 2020. To remove bias due to seasonal variation, the previous 2 year's records during the same period were reviewed and compared. Confirmed COVID-19 patients in the northern Gyeonggi Province were identified using data released by the government. And patients who came to the emergency department with head trauma and stroke were identified. RESULTS: Based on the present study results, the total number of neurosurgery emergency patients decreased over the study period. In the trauma patient group, the number of patients not involved in traffic accidents significantly decreased compared with patients involved in traffic accidents. Among the stroke cases, the rate of ischemic stroke was lower than hemorrhagic stroke, although a statistically significant difference was not observed. Meanwhile, an increase in the risk of mortality associated with trauma or stroke cases was not observed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same time period in the previous year. CONCLUSION: Due to the occurrence of COVID-19, non-essential activities have decreased and trauma cases not associated with traffic accidents appeared to decrease.

In this work, Taniaphos, a chiral ligand with rotatable spatial configuration, was employed as a chiral extractant to enantioseparate various amino acid enantiomers. Phenylalanine (Phe), homophenylalanine (Hphe), 4-nitrophenylalanine (Nphe), and 3-chloro-phenylglycine (Cpheg) were used as substrates to evaluate the extraction efficiency. The results revealed that Taniaphos-Cu exhibited good abilities to enantioseparate Phe, Hphe, Nphe, and Cpheg with the highest separation factors (&#945;) of 3.13, 2.10, 2.32, and 2.14, respectively. Taniaphos-Cu is more conducive to combine with D-amino acid in extraction.

Currently, the accumulating information on the effects of the infection regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of the disease, as well as outcomes within different DMTs? enable us to have better practices on the management of the Covid-19 infection in pwMS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to reveal the relationship between the demographic-clinical and therapeutic features and the outcome of Covid-19 infection in a multi-center national cohort of pwMS. METHODS: The Turkish Neurological Society-MS Study Group in association with the Italian MuSC-19 Study Group initiated this study. A web-based electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) of Study-MuSC-19 were used to collect the data. The demographic data and MS histories of the patients were obtained from the file tracking forms of the relevant clinics. RESULTS: 309 MS patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection were included in this study. Two hundred nineteen (219) were females (70.9%). The mean age was 36.9, ranging from 18 to 66, 194 of them (62.8%) were under 40. The clinical phenotype was relapsing-remitting in 277 (89.6%) and progressive in 32 (10.4%). Disease duration ranged from 0.2 years to 31.4 years. The median EDSS was 1.5, ranging from 0 to 8.5. The EDSS score was<= 1 in 134 (43%) of the patients. 91.6% of the patients were on a DMT, Fingolimod was the most frequently used drug (22.0%), followed by Interferon (20.1%). The comorbidity rate is 11.7%. We were not able to detect any significant association of DMTs with Covid-19 severity. CONCLUSION: The Turkish MS-Covid-19 cohort had confirmed that pwMS are not at risk of having a more severe COVID-19 outcome irrespective of the DMT that they are treated. In addition, due to being a younger population with less comorbidities most had a mild disease further highlight that the only associated risk factors for having a moderate to severe COVID-19 course are similar with the general population such as having comorbid conditions and being older.","output":"The outcome of a national MS-Covid-19 study: What the Turkish MS cohort reveals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation: COVID-19 has revived focus on improving equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health services in developing countries. Most public programming tends to rely on economic indicators to identify and target vulnerable groups. Can expanded targeting criteria that include social status help to improve not only targeting, but also equity in access to WASH and health services?. Purpose: This article assesses the role of social identity in mediating access to WASH and health services, controlling for economic disadvantages such as household wealth, income sources, and assets. Methods and approach: We use regression analysis applied to the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to estimate the relationships between social identity and access to WASH and health services, controlling for wealth (using wealth index quantiles) and remittances (using indicator variables for domestic and international remittances). Findings: We find that differences in access are mediated in large part by caste, and religious and ethnic identity, especially in rural areas, suggesting that the supply of such services is lower for historically disadvantaged communities. In addition, communities with least access are not necessarily the most economically disadvantaged, indicating that relying solely on traditional economic indicators to target programmes and interventions may not be sufficient to improve equity in access to public health services. Policy implications: The results make a case for broadening indicators beyond the economic criteria for improving targeting of public funds for more inclusive development. ? 2021 The Authors.

We sought to investigate sequential association, if any, between loneliness, activity, and affect. Methods We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with dynamic network analysis to investigate the affective and behavioral concomitants of loneliness in 22 residents of an independent living sector of a continuing care retirement community (mean age 80.2;range 68C93 years). Results Participants completed mean 83.9% of EMA surveys (SD = 16.1%). EMA ratings of loneliness were moderately correlated with UCLA loneliness scale scores. Network models showed that loneliness was contemporaneously associated with negative affect (worried, anxious, restless, irritable). Negative (but not happy or positive) mood tended to be followed by loneliness and then by exercise or outdoor physical activity. Negative affect had significant and high inertia (stability). Conclusions The data suggest that EMA is feasible and acceptable to older adults. EMA-assessed loneliness was moderately associated with scale-assessed loneliness. Network models in these independent living older adults indicated strong links between negative affect and loneliness, but feelings of loneliness were followed by outdoor activity, suggesting adaptive behavior among relatively healthy adults.","output":"Dynamics of Loneliness Among Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Pilot Study of Ecological Momentary Assessment With Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Africans pour dirty water around their houses which constitutes aquatic habitats (AH). These AH are sought by mosquitoes for larval development. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of destroying AH around houses in reducing malaria incidence. An agent-based model is proposed for controlling malarias incidence through population sensitizing campaigns on the harmful effects of AH around houses. METHODS: The environment is constituted of houses, AH, mosquitoes, humans, and hospital. Malarias spread dynamic is linked to the dynamics of humans and mosquitoes. The mosquitos dynamic is represented by egg-laying and seeking blood. The humans dynamic is animated by hitting mosquitoes. AH are destroyed each time by 10% of their starting number. The number of infected humans varied from 0-90 which led to a total of 1001 simulations. RESULTS: When the number of houses and AH is equal, the results are approximate as the field data. At each reduction of AH, the incidence and prevalence tend more and more towards 0. When there is no AH and infected humans, the prevalence and incidence are at 0. CONCLUSIONS: When there is no AH site, the disease disappears completely.

METHODS The study design is a retrospective series pilot study. The setting is a single, tertiary care academic medical center. Ten patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with NBCA injection of GV and had biphasic CT scans performed before and after injection therapy. Based on portal venous images, 3D reconstruction and semi-automated volume calculations of GV were performed. Pre and post injection GV volume calculations were compared. RESULTS The mean pre-procedure GV volume was 89.84 cm3. Eight patients had significant improvement in GV volume from pre-treatment versus post-treatment (95.65 cm3 vs. 49.65 cm3, P-value 0.04). Pre-procedure GV volume was not significantly different in patients treated for active hemorrhage versus no hemorrhage (101.66 cm3 vs. 72.11 cm3, P-value 0.33). Two patients had a subsequent GV hemorrhage after NBCA injection. The mean residual GV volume in these patients versus those that did not re-bleed was significantly more (127.77 cm3 vs. 38.00 cm3, P-value 0.005).

A 2014 survey reported a 44% prevalence of burnout among American oncologists. The purpose of this survey was to determine the national prevalence of burnout and document work engagement among Canadian radiation oncologists. Methods: Between November 2019 and March 2020 (pre COVID pandemic), an online questionnaire was distributed electronically to 333 Canadian radiation oncologists, across 49 centers, through the National Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology membership list. The survey included 62 questions determining job engagement, and validated burnout scale The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (22 questions). Results: 241 of the 333 surveyed Canadian radiation oncologists (72%) completed the questionnaire and were included in this analysis. Responses to the MBI showed that 15% of radiation oncologists met the strict criteria for burnout (i.e. negative scores in all 3 domains: exhaustion, depersonalization, and low accomplishment). Another 60% scored negative in at least one of the three burnout domains. Using the more commonly reported definition of burnout (negative scores in either exhaustion and/or depersonalization), 44% of Canadian radiation oncologists were burnt out. Only 25% had positive scores in all 3 domains and were fully engaged in their work. The full burnout syndrome varied between provinces and was the highest in British Columbia (22%) and lowest in Quebec (3%). The responses to work engagement questions revealed significant concerns regarding inefficiency in work flow (50%), heavy workloads (&gt;50%), poor work life balance (68%), lack of control over the work environment (47%) and lack of recognition from administrators (45%). 48% perceive the atmosphere at their primary work area as chaotic and hectic. Within the last 3 years, 41% had considered leaving their institution to work elsewhere and 51% were considering reducing their full-time equivalent (FTE). Reassuringly, 80% reported a sense of overall ability to provide high quality care and a 59% feel they have a supportive network of colleagues and 80% are willing to try something new. The top 4 strategies identified by respondents aimed to improve work-life quality were (1) more support staff at work, (2) more efficient care models, (3) more resources for patients, and (4) lighter workloads for physicians. Conclusion: The survey shows that only 25% of the Canadian radiation oncologists are fully engaged in their work, 15 % meet the strict criteria for burnout and 44% meet the more commonly used burnout criteria. With the rising incidence of cancer and complexity of care, there is an urgent need for change, leverage the enthusiasm to try something new, and develop appropriate strategies to improve the well-being of the oncology work force.","output":"MSOR07 Presentation Time: 10:30 AM: The Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology 2020 Radiation Oncologist Burnout and Work Engagement Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global crisis, with more than 1,430,000 confirmed cases and more than 85,000 confirmed deaths globally as of 9 April 20201-4.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m2.

The medical education fraternity was compelled to replace the traditional teaching method of hands-on cadaveric dissections (HOCDs) with online education to overcome this new challenge, but it came at the cost of reduced student engagement and lesser spatial orientation. Method: In this cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, we designed a novel online dissection course on lower limb anatomy and collected student feedback on the same from consenting Phase I Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students of Symbiosis Medical College for Women, Pune, India. The course design consisted of three different modes: a live Zoom session using a handheld camera phone, a pre-recorded video dissection uploaded on the institute learning management system, and a Powerpoint presentation with high-resolution photographs of each dissected layer; and the feedback intended to find out what works best for the students. Overall feedback regarding their preferences in terms of presentation design, use of background music in pre-recorded videos, and overall learning experience was also collected. The course consisted of six two-hour teaching sessions. The first three sessions each used a different mode of teaching, repeating the same pattern in the next three sessions. The first mode of teaching implemented was a live Zoom session where instructors used a hand-held cell phone camera to show specimens that had been dissected a day prior. The second mode involved a pre-recorded video showing step-by-step dissection performed by the instructor which was then uploaded on the Institute Learning Management System. Of the two pre-recorded videos, background music consisting of a low-volume instrumental track was added to the second video. The third mode utilized Powerpoint presentations containing high-resolution photographs of each dissected layer on a separate slide along with labeling. The presentations were shown to the students over a Zoom call. A Google Form (GF) questionnaire was created after validation by subject experts to gather the students feedback on the teaching and learning of anatomy via these sessions. The GF responses were collected and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: 41.7% of students recommended the use of a combination of all three modes in the same session, while 36.7% favored pre-recorded videos. 86.7% of students said that a good quality presentation design helps in keeping them engaged and only 23% of students favored the use of background music for increasing their ability to concentrate. 63.3% of students found the learning experience highly satisfactory. Conclusion: Although virtual dissection teaching methods may not be able to completely replace HOCDs, a well-planned online dissection course incorporating multiple modes of online dissections with an emphasis on good quality presentation design and frequent teacher-student interactivity can provide a strong impetus for learning in the absence of live teaching methods.","output":"A Novel Online Dissection Course on Lower Limb Anatomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Recent studies positing the gut as a sanctuary site for viral persistence in SARS-CoV-2 infection highlight the importance of assimilating profiles of systemic as well as gut inflammatory mediators to understand the pathology of COVID-19.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (n=58) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals included a group of in-patients (n=36) at various stages of disease progression together with convalescent individuals (n=22) recruited between April and June 2020 (peak of the epidemic) from a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. Follow-up of 11 in-patients at day 7 post diagnosis was carried out, resulting in a total of 47 in-patient samples. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based testing of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the measurement of inflammatory markers including Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and levels of soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (sMAdCAM) in plasma. Anti-viral humoral response was measured by rapid antibody test (IgG, IgM) and chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) (IgG). Also antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Secondary outcomes were correlation of the inflammatory signature with clinical information, including age, sex, disease duration and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Twenty eight of 36 (78%) in-patients and 19 of 22 (86%) convalescents were males. Out of 47 in-patient samples, 22 (46%), 11 (23%) and 14 (30%) were IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM- respectively. Of 22 convalescent samples, 3 (14%), 1 (4%) and 17 (77%) were respectively IgG-/IgM-, IgG+/IgM+ and IgG+/IgM-. Two out of 22 (9%) convalescents showed high IL-6 levels (>100pg/ml) and 4 (18%) had high TNF levels (>30pg/ml). However, the convalescents (n =22) had significantly lower levels of IL-6 [Median=27.48 (IQR=23.54-39.92)] compared to followed up in-patients (n = 11) at day 0 [Median=111(IQR=68-129.7), p =0.0002] and higher levels of sMAdCAM [Median=1940 (1711-2174) pg/ml] compared to these individuals at day 0 [Median=1701 (IQR=1532-1836) pg/ml; p=0.032] and day 7 [Median=1534 (IQR=1236-1654) pg/ml; p=0.0007]. Further, IL-6 and sMAdCAM levels among in-patients inversely correlated with one another (r =-0.374, p = 0.009, CI = 95%). When expressed as a novel integrated marker, sMIL (sMAdCAM/IL-6 ratio) index, these levels were incrementally and significantly higher across various disease states with convalescents exhibiting the highest values [Median= 64.74 (IQR=47.33-85.58)]. Also, the sMIL index was significantly higher in convalescents (with class-switched responses) compared to IgG+/IgM+ individuals at early stages of infection [Median=28.65 (IQR=13.63-96.26), p = 0.034]. Real-time measurement by SPR of plasma antibody binding to viral nucleocapsid (NC), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) revealed waxing and waning of plasma antibody responses to all 3 targets. Importantly, sMAdCAM levels as well as sMIL index (fold change) correlated with peak association rates of RBD-binding (r = 0.462, p = 0.03, CI = 95%) and fold change in binding to S (r = 0.68, p = 0.050, CI = 95%) respectively. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results highlight key systemic and gut-associated immune parameters that need to be monitored and investigated further to optimally guide therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for COVID-19.","output":"sMAdCAM:IL-6 (sMIL Index): A novel signature associated with COVID-19 disease progression and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a roadmap is proposed and introduced to support educational policies, plans, strategies, and practices in developing countries The operational research approaches are used to identify and assess all academic activities and processes such as educational policies, educational settlement and equipment, educational curricula & courses, teaching methods, capacity building, funding & budgeting, and educational evaluation The systematical academic performances (access, equity, quality, relevance, efficiency) will be considered, including the gaps and expectations of various stakeholders on education and training policy, evaluating the policy's sufficiency and its implementation strategy feeling the current vision and the development perspectives of these countries The proposed roadmap will serve as a tool or reference point for setting ambitious improvement goals Building government education officials' capacity increases the potential for improvement in numerous ways, as it provides a systematic approach to quality improvement by identifying new ideas and innovative approaches","output":"Roadmap for Education Development Post COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"These extraordinary months due to COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests, set as they are against a backdrop of the increasingly worrying climate emergency, have brought fear, anxiety and discord across the globe.

The clinical spectrum of MIS-C ranges from mild to severe, and even to mortal multisystem involvement. To guide clinicians, we evaluated detailed demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcomes of MIS-C cases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients with MIS-C who were managed in the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease in the Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. MIS-C patients were divided into three clinical severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and separated into three age groups (< 5 years, 5C10 years, > 10 years). We compared the characteristics of MIS-C cases according to the severity of the disease and by age groups. RESULT: Thirty-six children with MIS-C were evaluated (52.8% male, median age of 7.8 years). A clinical spectrum overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD) was the most common presentation (69.4%) in all age groups. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (100%), mucocutaneous rash (69.4%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (66.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in echocardiographic abnormality between KD-like and the other clinical spectra (p > 0.05). All life-threatening rhythm disturbances were observed in severe cases. No patients died. CONCLUSION: It is important to increase the awareness of physicians about the MIS-C disease, which can present with different combinations of different systemic findings, so that patients can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.","output":"Clinical features and outcome of MIS-C patients: an experience from Central Anatolia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) is associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Children and young adults with MIS-C typically present with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally, respiratory symptoms. Myocardial dysfunction (as measured by TTE, elevated troponin, or elevated brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) has been reported in 51-90% of these patients. Case Report An 18-year-old male without significant medical history was transferred to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit with cardiogenic shock after presenting with headache, myalgias, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Initial workup revealed hypotension, tachycardia, and positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severe biventricular failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 26%. Vasopressors were started for blood pressure support. Right heart catheterization (RHC) was consistent with cardiogenic shock. Impella CP percutaneous left ventricular assist device was placed. The patient developed hypoxemia and tachypnea. He was intubated and underwent cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). He was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute anuric renal failure. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed benign myocardium. Vasopressors were weaned and repeat TTE on day 3 revealed LVEF of 34%;subsequent TTE on day 5 showed recovery up to 53%. The Impella device was removed, VA ECMO was decannulated, and the patient was extubated. He improved clinically over the next weeks with normalizing vital signs, inflammatory markers, respiratory status, and renal function. The patient was discharged on day 28, about six weeks after symptom onset. TTE prior to discharge revealed mild LV hypertrophy and normal systolic function. Summary As illustrated in this case, timely recognition of cardiogenic shock is critical. This patient developed acute-onset cardiogenic shock, which required early escalation to temporary mechanical circulatory support. Additionally, this patient's care was complex and the case highlights the importance of early coordination between teams. Meetings were held nearly daily, with collaboration contributing to a multidisciplinary workup and treatment plan that ultimately led to the full recovery of this young patient.","output":"A Case of Cardiogenic Shock in a Young Adult with COVID-19-Induced Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory rate is recognized as a clinically important parameter for monitoring respiratory status on the general care floor (GCF). Currently, intermittent manual assessment of respiratory rate is the standard of care on the GCF. This technique has several clinically-relevant shortcomings, including the following: (1) it is not a continuous measurement, (2) it is prone to observer error, and (3) it is inefficient for the clinical staff. We report here on an algorithm designed to meet clinical needs by providing respiratory rate through a standard pulse oximeter. Finger photoplethysmograms were collected from a cohort of 63 GCF patients monitored during free breathing over a 25-min period. These were processed using a novel in-house algorithm based on continuous wavelet-transform technology within an infrastructure incorporating confidence-based averaging and logical decision-making processes. The computed oximeter respiratory rates (RRoxi) were compared to an end-tidal CO2 reference rate (RRETCO2). RRETCO2 ranged from a lowest recorded value of 4.7 breaths per minute (brpm) to a highest value of 32.0 brpm. The mean respiratory rate was 16.3 brpm with standard deviation of 4.7 brpm. Excellent agreement was found between RRoxi and RRETCO2, with a mean difference of -0.48 brpm and standard deviation of 1.77 brpm. These data demonstrate that our novel respiratory rate algorithm is a potentially viable method of monitoring respiratory rate in GCF patients. This technology provides the means to facilitate continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, coupled with arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate, using a single non-invasive sensor in low acuity settings.","output":"Pulse oximetry-derived respiratory rate in general care floor patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Despite the fact that the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPVV) has been approved in mainland China since 2016, there is a lack of inoculation among Chinese college women. This multi-center, online interventional RCT based on the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model intended to investigate if the intervention may improve human papillomavirus vaccine acceptance and awareness among target women. METHODS: Participants were selected from comprehensive universities and allocated to 1 of 2 groups: intervention or control. After the baseline survey, participants in the intervention group were given 10-minute online IMB model-based education every day for 7 days. Self-administered questionnaire surveys on Human papillomavirus knowledge, HPVV acceptability, and IMB construct toward HPV vaccination were performed at pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: The baseline survey was completed by 3739 female university students from the intervention (n = 1936) and control groups (n = 1803) between February and April 2020. The average score of students on 11 HPV-related questions was 5.225  2.739, and only 32.07% (1199/3739) of them showed a willingness to be vaccinated against HPV. After the intervention, the intervention group had a higher willingness to vaccinate themselves and encourage their friends to get the HPVV compared to the control group (40.39% vs 31.56%, 82.67 vs 73.18%, P < .001), and the difference in knowledge scores between the 2 groups was significant (7.917  1.840 vs 5.590  2.859, P < .001).

The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation of the ABCDEF-bundle and supportive care provided to patients with COVID-19 infections in ICUs. Methods: This was a world-wide two-day point prevalence study, on June 3 and July 1, 2020. A total of 212 ICUs in 38 countries (166 ICUs on Day 1 and 212 on Day 2) participated. Clinicians in each participating ICU completed web-based online surveys. The implementation rate for elements of the ABCDEF-bundle, other supportive ICU care measures and implementation associated structures were investigated. RESULTS Data for 262 patients was collected during the two-day study. Of patients included, 124 (47.3%) underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) and 12 (4.6%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The proportion of patients with implementation of each element was: Element A (regular pain assessment) 45%;B (both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials) 28%;C (regular sedation assessment) 52%;D (regular delirium assessment) 38%;E (early mobility and exercise) 47%;and F (family engagement and empowerment) 16%. The implementation of element E for patients on MV was 16% and ECMO was 17%. Supportive care, such as providing protein throughout the ICU stay (under 1.2g/kg for more than 50% of the patients) and introduction of an ICU diary (25%) was inadequate. A higher implementation rate of elements A and D were recognized in ICUs with specific protocols for ICU care and lower numbers of ICU beds exclusively for patients with COVID-19 infection. Element E was implemented at a higher rate in ICUs with more ICU beds for patients with COVID-19 infection.

Limited by the ability of the country or city to perform tests, the officially reported number of confirmed cases is expected to be much smaller than the true number of infected cases. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a new susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed-removed (SEICR) model for predicting the spreading progression of COVID-19 with consideration of intercity travel and the difference between the number of confirmed cases and actual infected cases, and to apply the model to provide a realistic prediction for the United States and Japan under different scenarios of active intervention. METHODS: The model introduces a new state variable corresponding to the actual number of infected cases, integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that a realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. RESULTS: By fitting the model with the data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the United States (February 20 to March 20, 2020), model parameters were found and then used to predict the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the United States. The model revealed that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the United States could be 20-fold and 5-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. The results showed that, without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the United States will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, respectively, and with a drastic 10-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: The new SEICR model has revealed the effectiveness of active intervention for controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Among neonates with throat swab SARS-CoV-2 positive only five (33.3%) had concomitant placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood samples tested, of which only one amniotic fluid sample is positive for RT PCR. Five neonates had elevated IgG and IgM but without intrauterine tissue tested. Four neonates had chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Currently there is not enough evidence on vertical virologic transmission of COVID-19 infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no evidence to support cesarean delivery, abstaining from breast feeding nor mother and infant separation. Further research involving an adequate sample size of breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, and cord blood to ascertain the possibility of vertical transmission and breast milk transfer is needed.","output":"Vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged, causing an outbreak of life-threatening pneumonia in the Hubei province, China, and has now spread worldwide, causing a pandemic. The urgent need to control the disease, combined with the lack of specific and effective treatment modalities, call for the use of FDA-approved agents that have shown efficacy against similar pathogens. Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin have all been successful in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The initial results of a number of clinical trials involving various protocols of administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine mostly point towards their beneficial effect. However, they may not be effective in cases with persistently high viremia, while results on ivermectin (another antiparasitic agent) are not yet available. Interestingly, azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might yield clinical benefit as an adjunctive. The results of clinical trials point to the potential clinical efficacy of antivirals, especially remdesivir (GS-5734), lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir. Other therapeutic options that are being explored involve meplazumab, tocilizumab, and interferon type 1. We discuss a number of other drugs that are currently in clinical trials, whose results are not yet available, and in various instances we enrich such efficacy analysis by invoking historic data on the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, or in vitro studies. Meanwhile, scientists worldwide are seeking to discover novel drugs that take advantage of the molecular structure of the virus, its intracellular life cycle that probably elucidates unfolded-protein response, as well as its mechanism of surface binding and cell invasion, like angiotensin converting enzymes-, HR1, and metalloproteinase inhibitors.","output":"FDA approved drugs with pharmacotherapeutic potential for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering intrapreneurship theory, this study aims to examine the extent to which the entrepreneurial orientation of faculty employed at Kuwaiti higher education institutions differ across their individual-level attributes. Faculty entrepreneurial orientation will be assessed at three levels, i.e., innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactivity. For this purpose, we surveyed a sample of 291 faculty from Kuwaiti colleges and universities. The core constructs were operationalized using scales validated in previous studies. The hypothesized relationships were tested using the structural equation modeling method. Our findings indicate that while female faculty are more proactive than men, males are innovative and risk-takers to some extent. Moreover, Ph.D. holders are more proactive and innovative than Masters degree holders. The relationship between specialization and both innovativeness and risk-taking is significant only for business, but not for engineering. Teaching experience is more positively correlated with faculty proactivity. The number of scientific publications is negatively associated with faculty risk-taking propensity. Additionally, faculty who cumulated significant industry experience are proactive in identifying long-term opportunities and threats for their institutions. Having earned professional certifications is positively related to some aspects of innovativeness and proactivity. Finally, faculty who received their latest degree from a non-accredited institution are more active in realizing ideas at work.","output":"Relationship between faculty characteristics and their entrepreneurial orientation in higher education institutions in Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are gaps in knowledge regarding the association between the ABO blood group and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) immediate and long\\\\term outcomes.

While the refining of crude oil to produce transportation fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and a variety of other products has brought manifold benefits, it has also led to the global proliferation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as local air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels. The industry is therefore confronted with a growing need to decarbonize its operations, as well as to support decarbonization of the end use sectors that it directly enables. This paper provides a systematic and critical literature review to uncover the means by which the oil refining industry can decarbonize and evolve as part of an increasingly carbon constrained future. A sociotechnical perspective is used to understand the full range of industrial and economic activities where a decarbonized oil refining industry is expected to remain important and to provide the framework to assess key technical, economic, social and political factors that will likely impact the evolution of the oil refining industry. We highlight key opportunities for this industry to decarbonize while also exposing gaps in the existing literature concerning its decarbonization. The insights provided are expected to support policy makers, researchers and practitioners with the tools needed advance a low-carbon transition of the oil refining industry.","output":"Decarbonizing the oil refining industry: A systematic review of sociotechnical systems, technological innovations, and policy options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global pandemic as announced by World Health Organisation. As India has already met the two waves, named first and second wave, it is assumed that COVID-19 will again strike in India in the form of third wave. The peak during the upcoming third wave and determination of the approximated maximum number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths at a particular day becomes crucial for India. To determine the peak of infectious curve, this article proposed a hybrid fuzzy time series forecasting model based on particle swarm optimization and fuzzy c-mean technique, named as fuzzy time series particle swarm optimization extended fuzzy c-mean technique. The proposed model works in two phases. In phase-I, particle swarm optimization extended fuzzy c-mean method is used to form initial intervals with the help of centroids, while in phase-II, these intervals are updated to form subintervals. In the present article, a fitness function is developed for particle swarm optimization to increase its convergence speed and basic fuzzy c-mean is extended by using an exponential function to tolerate the effect of outliers, named as extended fuzzy c-mean technique. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been tested based on mean square error and root mean square error on first and second wave COVID-19 data, and the obtained results are very close to the existing data of COVID-19 with less error rate. Thus, the proposed model is suitable to forecast a better approximation value of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in India during the upcoming third wave. This study demonstrates that third wave of COVID-19 could occur in India, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. The proposed model predicts that the peak of third wave will occur approximately after 40C70 days from the mid of December. Furthermore, the impact of vaccination on infected cases and deaths during the upcoming third wave in India is also studied. With the implementation of the vaccine on the Indian people, the peak of COVID-19 infected during third wave will be shifted in forward direction. On the basis of the proposed model, government authorities will be enabling to know expected required resources such as hospital patient beds, ICU beds, and oxygen concentrators during the upcoming outspread of COVID-19 like disease in future.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is among one of the most important TLR proteins of innate immunity that is responsible for broad antiviral response and immune system control. TLR7 agonists, as both vaccine adjuvants and immune response modulators, are among the top drug candidates for not only our contemporary viral pandemic but also other diseases. The agonists of TLR7 have been utilized as vaccine adjuvants and antiviral agents. In this study, we hybridized a statistical learning-based QSAR model with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to extract new antiviral drugs by drug repurposing of the DrugBank database. First, we manually curated a dataset consisting of TLR7 agonists. The molecular descriptors of these compounds were extracted, and feature engineering was done to restrict the number of features to 45. We applied a statistically inspired modification of the partial least squares (SIMPLS) method to build our QSAR model. In the next stage, the DrugBank database was virtually screened structurally using molecular docking, and the top compounds for the guanosine binding site of TLR were identified. The result of molecular docking was again screened by the ligand-based approach of QSAR to eliminate compounds that do not display strong EC50 values by the previously trained model. We then subjected the final results to molecular dynamics simulation and compared our compounds with imiquimod (an FDA-approved TLR7 agonist) and compound 1 (the most active compound against TLR7 in vitro, EC50 = 0.2 nM). Our results evidently demonstrate that cephalosporins and nucleotide analogues (especially acyclic nucleotide analogues such as adefovir and cidofovir) are computationally potent agonists of TLR7. We finally reviewed some publications about cephalosporins that, just like pieces of a puzzle, completed our conclusion.","output":"Discovery of new TLR7 agonists by a combination of statistical learning-based QSAR, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The forcing online of higher education classes should have constituted a major reckoning of pedagogical practices in universities, particularly in the humanities. Such a reckoning seems to have been muted by a focus on logistical concerns and by what might be called a false sense of preparedness within university departments. This study attempts to counter that general trend by taking seriously the cognitive and emotional demands of the online transition through a philosophical lens. This essay presents a phenomenological study of the abrupt transition from physical to online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown of universities. Reworking two central theses of Marshall McLuhan's (1994) study of media, the author proposes two dispositions as necessary to encountering the role of new media in the teaching of the humanities: a state of wilful unpreparedness and a state of artistic creativity. These in turn pose educational dilemmas that require changes to the relationship between teachers, students and the learning environment, wherein these relationships become subjects of conscious study by the participants. The article draws on a range of classroom experiences in which the instructor and students attempted such a study.

Nevertheless, the possibility of a paediatric patient requiring surgery, especially high-risk aerosol-generating surgery on the airway, while having the SARS-CoV-2 infection may potentially result in problems during the perioperative period due to concerns regarding patient, family, and staff safety. When unplanned and unrehearsed, this scenario may cause delays and efficiency issues. Our aim is to report on an 8-year-old patient with a foreign object lodged in the oesophagus with COVID-19 that required emergency surgery. Case Report. An 8-year-old female patient came to the emergency room with a history of difficulty in swallowing for 12 hours before admission, having accidentally swallowed a metal coin while playing. She did not have any recent history of disease, but her parents had noticed that, for the previous 4 days, she had had a mild fever and dry cough. Her parents and other relatives in the house had no similar complaints, and they assured us they had not been in contact with any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Our goal was to create a safe paediatric anaesthesia environment with safe working conditions for the surgical team. In this case report, we will describe our approach to patient transport, parental presence, preventions of aerosol risk, personal protection, the anaesthesia induction technique, and postoperative management. CONCLUSION: Safe paediatric anaesthesia, especially in a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure, during the COVID-19 era requires consideration and preparation of both the patient and healthcare provider.

We investigated whether remote home-based PR maintenance strategy via social media (WeChat) is effective on clinical improvements and reducing the risk for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: The eligible stable COPD patients completing an initial 8-week PR were allocated into three groups randomly. Group A: PR maintenance via social media supervision at home. Group B: PR maintenance at hospital. Group C: Usual care. During a 12-month follow-up, the frequency of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), 6 minutes walking test (6MWT), COPD assessment test (CAT), and modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) were evaluated every 3 months. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, compared to the decline in the usual care group (n = 49), the clinical improvements of 6MWD, CAT, and mMRC were sustained in both the home-based group (n = 47) and the hospital-based maintenance group (n = 44) (p < 0.001), no difference was observed between these two groups (p > 0.05). In multivariate analysis, the home-based PR maintenance and hospital-based PR maintenance were independent predictors of lower risk for AECOPD (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.712, 95% CI 0.595C0.841, p < 0.001 and IRR 0.799, 95% CI 0.683C0.927, p = 0.002), respectively.

A recent randomized controlled trial showed that preterm infants [gestational age (GA) < 30 weeks] stabilized with an initial high FiO2 (1.0) had a significantly higher breathing effort than infants stabilized with a low FiO2 (0.3). As the diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle in these infants, we aimed to describe the effects of the initial FiO2 on diaphragm activity. Methods: In a subgroup of infants from the original bi-center randomized controlled trial diaphragm activity was measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG), using three skin electrodes that were placed directly after birth. Diaphragm activity was compared in the first 5 min after birth. From the dEMG respiratory waveform several outcome measures were determined for comparison of the groups: average peak- and tonic inspiratory activity (dEMGpeak and dEMGton, respectively), inspiratory amplitude (dEMGamp), area under the curve (dEMGAUC) and the respiratory rate (RR). Results: Thirty-one infants were included in this subgroup, of which 29 could be analyzed [n = 15 (median GA 28.4 weeks) and n = 14 (median GA 27.9 weeks) for the 100 and 30% oxygen group, respectively]. Tonic diaphragm activity was significantly higher in the high FiO2-group (4.3  2.1 V vs. 2.9  1.1 V; p = 0.047). The other dEMG-parameters (dEMGpeak, dEMGamp, dEMGAUC) showed consistently higher values in the high FiO2 group, but did not reach statistical significance. Average RR showed similar values in both groups (34  9 vs. 32  10 breaths/min for the high and low oxygen group, respectively). Conclusion: Preterm infants stabilized with an initial high FiO2 showed significantly more tonic diaphragm activity and an overall trend toward a higher level of diaphragm activity than those stabilized with an initial low FiO2. These results confirm that a high initial FiO2 after birth stimulates breathing effort, which can be objectified with dEMG.","output":"The Effect of Initial Oxygen Exposure on Diaphragm Activity in Preterm Infants at Birth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, computed tomography (CT) has become widely used in patients with suspected or known coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This prospective observational study in 28 invasively ventilated and 18 non-invasively ventilated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 contamination aims at investigating SARS-CoV-2 contamination of CT scanner surfaces and its infectiousness. METHODS: Swab sampling of the CT table and gantry before and after CT examinations was performed. Additionally, the CT ventilation system air grid was wiped off after each examination. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ribonucleic acid) and viral cell culture were performed in the virology core lab. RESULTS: After examination of non-invasively ventilated or non-ventilated patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 11.1% (4/36) on patient near surfaces (CT table and gantry) and in 16.7% (3/18) on the CT air grid respectively after examination of invasively ventilated patients in 5.4% (3/56) on CT table and gantry and 7.1% (2/28) on the CT air grid. Surface contamination was more common in non-invasively ventilated or non-ventilated patients with a high viral load who were actively coughing. RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) was high (35.96C39.31) in all positive samples and no positive viral cell culture was found.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Silicone discs were exposed to bacterial urine suspension for 168 hours. The antimicrobial activities were assessed in the medium, and the inhibition zone diameters were measured. The weight of the silicones was measured for biofilm growth assessment before and after the experiment, and confocal microscopy images were taken. RESULTS Although the inhibition zone diameters of silver nitrate silicones were larger than those of pure silicone (PS), MR, and NF silicones, biofilm formation could not be prevented (P < .05). MR and NF silicones were superior to PS in terms of antimicrobial efficacy and prevention of biofilm formation (P < .05). In terms of biofilm prevention, no differences were detected between NF and MR silicones apart from a slightly superior ability of MR silicones to inhibit Escherichia coli (P > .05). Biofilm formation occurred on all silicone discs. CONCLUSION In short-term urinary catheter utilization, antimicrobial efficacy and biofilm formation prevention were superior in coated silicones, regardless of the type of antibiotic used, compared with the control group (PS).

While countries, including India, have taken strong measures to control the spread of COVID-19 through better diagnostics and treatment. Vaccines will provide a lasting solution by enhancing Immunity and containing the disease spread. COVID-19 vaccine has been rolled out recently in several parts of the world. Although the protective efficiency is frequently discussed, little is known about the real-world post-vaccination experience outside of clinical trial conditions. Knowledge about what to expect after vaccination will help educate the public, dispel misinformation and reduce vaccine hesitancy. Objectives: To assess the immediate response to the first dose of Covid- 19 vaccine and to study the side effects of Covid- 19 vaccination.

Protein expression of Trx system family members has been assessed in various cancers and linked to various clinicopathological variables, disease progression, treatment response and survival outcomes but information is lacking in brain tumours. Expression of the system was therefore examined, by immunohistochemistry in different brain tumour types, adult and paediatric cases, to determine if expression was of importance to clinical outcome. Trx system proteins were expressed, to variable levels, across all brain tumour types with significant variations in expression between different tumour types/grades/regions. High Trx reductase (TrxR) expression was linked to worse prognosis across all cohorts. High cytoplasmic TrxR expression was significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in adult glioblastoma (P = 0.027) and paediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (P = 0.012). High expression of nuclear TrxR, cytoplasmic and nuclear Trx and Trx-interacting protein (TxNIP) was associated with improved OS in paediatric LGGs (P = 0.031, P < 0.001, P = 0.044 and P = 0.018, respectively). For patients with high-grade gliomas, both high cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx expression were associated with poor OS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively).

Notably, fewer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 progress from acute disease onset to death compared with the progression rate associated with two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Several research organizations and pharmaceutical industries have attempted to develop successful vaccine candidates for the prevention of COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 genome undergoes frequent mutation;thus, an adequate analysis of the viral strain remains necessary to construct effective vaccines. The current study attempted to design a multi-epitope vaccine by utilizing an approach based on the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. We predicted the antigenic T- and B-lymphocyte responses to four structural proteins after screening all structural proteins according to specific characteristics. The predicted epitopes were combined using suitable adjuvants and linkers, and a secondary structure profile indicated that the vaccine shared similar properties with the native protein. Importantly, the molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the constructed vaccine possessed a high affinity for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In addition, multiple descriptors were obtained from the simulation trajectories, including the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and radius of gyration (R-g), demonstrating the rigid nature and inflexibility of the vaccine and receptor molecules. In addition, codon optimization, based on Escherichia coli K12, was used to determine the GC content and the codon adaptation index (CAI) value, which further followed for the incorporation into the cloning vector pET28+(a).

The research aimed to analyze fad diets, nutritional status, and nutritional adequacy of female models in Malang. The research design was cross-sectional in 52 female models aged 18C25 years who were selected by simple random sampling. The data of fad diets used in the questionnaire, nutritional status data using the calculation of the last body weight and height, and nutritional adequacy were measured using 2  24 hour food recall. Data analysis used the chi-square test. The results of this research showed that most respondents implement fad diets (69%), had negative body image (62%), had a skinny at high level (22%), skinny at mild level (44%), and normal (33%) of nutritional status, and had inadequate nutritional adequacy (77%). There was a significant (p=0.023) correlation between fad diets and nutritional adequacy (r = 0.369), and in addition, there was a significant correlation (p=0.041) between nutritional status and nutritional adequacy (r = 0.35).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched ( www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de ). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123 947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). RESULTS: During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.67, p<0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p<0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p<0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020.

CONCLUSION: The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A rapid non-invasive method to detect mild or asymptomatic infection would have a major impact on public health campaigns to control COVID-19.

To test this hypothesis, we enrolled SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected children admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center and analyzed their breath volatile composition. Targeted volatiles analysis revealed that six volatile organic compounds increased significantly in SARS-CoV-2-infected children. Three aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, and heptanal) drew special attention as candidate biomarkers, because viral infections have previously been shown to induce aldehyde production. Together, these biomarkers demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 66.6% specificity.

Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating the virus-induced Master Regulator signature.

TLR-3 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, and macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating both the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections. Influenza viruses can effectively inhibit the host's ability to produce interferons, and thereby suppress the immune system's antiviral defence mechanisms. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA comprising of polyriboinosinic-poly ribocytidylic acid (Poly IC) stabilized with l-lysine (L) and carboxymethylcellulose (C). Poly ICLC and liposome-encapsulated Poly ICLC (LE Poly ICLC) are TLR-3 agonists and are potent inducer of interferons and natural killer cells. Intranasal pre-treatment of mice with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC provided high level of protection against lethal challenge with a highly lethal avian H5N1 influenza (HPAI) strain (A/H5N1/chicken/Henan clade 2), and against lethal seasonal influenza A/PR/8/34 [H1N1] and A/Aichi/2 [H3N2] virus strains. The duration of protective antiviral immunity to multiple lethal doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus had been previously found to persist for up to 3 weeks in mice for LE Poly ICLC and 2 weeks for Poly ICLC. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with CpG oligonucleotides (TLR-9 agonist) was also found to provide complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 infection in mice.

Caudal block planned to be administered postoperatively for postoperative analgesia then performed after palpation of sacral cornu with 8 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine. A few minutes later, the patient became apneic, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation dropped abruptlyimmediate resuscitation with ventilatory support, fluid bolus, and atropine administration.

After close follow-up for 24 h in the post-anesthesia care unit patient was discharged to the pediatric ward then discharged to home without any neurologic sequelae after 3 days. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Total spinal anesthesia in a very infrequent incident during central neuraxial blocks, especially in the pediatrics population where a caudal block is usually performed. Manifestation of this event can be detected by loss of consciousness, cessation of respiratory effort, hemodynamic instability, and dilated pupils. Delayed treatment can result in cardiopulmonary arrest. CONCLUSION: Unanticipated total spinal anesthesia following central neuraxial blocks can potentially cause severe adverse consequences.

Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia. Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the 24C48 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules 500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from gavage, after feeding. DISCUSSION: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications, ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism.

Research findings indicate that PDCoV has evolved strategies to escape innate immune response in host cells, but mechanism of PDCoV in innate immune modulation is not well understood. In this study, we report our findings on identifying the alterations of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection and exploring the gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells at 0, 24, and 36 h PDCoV post infection by RNA sequencing. A total of 3,762 and 560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparison of uninfected PK-15 cells and infected PK-15 cells at 24 h post infection (hpi) (INF_24h versus NC), and also comparison of infected PK-15 cells between 24 and 36 hpi (INF_36h versus INF_24h), which included 156 and 23 porcine innate immune-related genes in the DEGs of INF_24h versus NC and INF_36h versus INF_24h, respectively. Gene Ontology function classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on the DEGs that exhibited the same expression tendencies with most of the innate immune-associated genes among these PK-15 cell samples described above. The enrichment results indicated that extensive gene functions and signaling pathways including innate immune-associated functions and pathways were affected by PDCoV infection. Particularly, 4 of 5 innate immune signaling pathways, which were primarily affected by PDCoV, played important roles in I-IFNs antiviral function in innate immune response. Additionally, 16 of the host cell endogenous miRNAs were predicted as potential contributors to the modulation of innate immune response affected by PDCoV. Our research findings indicated that the innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways in PK-15 cells could be modified by the infection of PDCoV, which provides a fundamental foundation for further studies to better understand the mechanism of PDCoV infections, so as to effectively control and prevent PDCoV-induced swine diarrheal disease outbreaks.","output":"Transcriptome analysis of PK-15 cells in innate immune response to porcine deltacoronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic's hold on our lives represents a moment of crisis with regards to what really impacts our ways of life, having introduced in our everyday existence not only the fear of infection but also the even more distressful fear of death.

Rapid review of available data is a quick way of providing useful information and insight into the way medical practice has been affected by the COVID pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a systematic rapid review, based on a literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. We considered all studies on gynaecological oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic using relevant keywords and MeSH terms. Selection criteria were English language, studies with more than five cases and publication in peer-review journal. RESULTS: Nine retrospective studies, one systematic review and five questionnaire surveys were included. Quality of the studies has been assessed. Development of higher quality evidence is warranted. Mortality of COVID-19 infection is higher in patients with gynaecological cancer than in non-cancer patients. Reported delays in diagnosis and management of cancer and changes in treatments, may affect the natural history of cancer and increase patients anxiety and fear of disease progression while causing concerns to healthcare professionals affecting their clinical practice. The number of new diagnoses has declined. Prioritization is important, face-to-face interactions should be limited, and appropriate protective measures are essential. Cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy should continue as high priority practices. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical practice significantly.

The age and body mass index (BMI) are important predictors of clinical outcome after surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures. In this study, we investigate whether these also influence the outcome of patients after Achilles tendon reconstruction using the ALT-FL flap. METHODS Twenty patients (mean age: 55.9  8.7 years) with complex tissue defects involving the Achilles tendon underwent reconstruction with the ALT-FL flap. Both the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score were assessed preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. In addition, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and measurements of the ankle range of motion were performed and results compared with existing literature. RESULTS All flaps survived and MRI studies confirmed complete anatomical integration of the fascia lata as \\"neotendon\\" at the recipient site. In our patient cohort, the age did not correlate with the outcome measurements, whereas the BMI showed significant negative correlation with the postoperative ATRS (p < 0.001) and AOFAS scores (p < 0.05). The ATRS and AOFAS scores of all patients improved significantly (p < 0.001). However, obese patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 achieved significant lower ATRS (p < 0.001) and AOFAS scores (p < 0.01), as well as patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) (p < 0.05). The mean ankle range of motion after ALT-FL flap reconstruction remained statistical insignificant compared with previous avascular or vascularized tendon repairs of the Achilles tendon. CONCLUSION The ALT-FL flap enables reconstruction of complex tissue defects involving the Achilles tendon with good functional results. However, the presence of an increased BMI or PAD, but not necessarily the age, proves to be a predictor of poor clinical outcome and therefore should be subject to scrutiny during patient selection.","output":"Predictors of Clinical Outcome after Reconstruction of Complex Soft Tissue Defects Involving the Achilles Tendon with the Composite Anterolateral Thigh Flap with Vascularized Fascia Lata."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since it emerged in Brazil in May 2015, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has raised global concern due to its association with a significant rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr syndrome.

The subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array (MNA). The immunogenicity of these two vaccines, named Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and ZIKV-rEfl, was tested in C57BL/6 mice. Prime/boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a ZIKV-specific antibody response, which provided neutralizing immunity. Moreover, protection was evaluated in seven-day-old pups after virulent ZIKV intraperitoneal challenge. Pups born to mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl were all protected against lethal challenge infection without weight loss or neurological signs, while pups born to dams immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl were partially protected (50%). No protection was seen in pups born to phosphate buffered saline-immunized mice.

It uses different strategies for positive and negative SNRs, with the switching between the two steered by a blind decision stage utilizing modulation cues. The output of the model is a single-channel signal with enhanced SNR, which we analyzed using the speech intelligibility index to compare speech intelligibility predictions. In a first experiment, the model was tested on experimental data obtained in a scenario with spatially separated target and masker signals. Predicted speech recognition thresholds were in good agreement with measured speech recognition thresholds with a root mean square error less than 1 dB. A second experiment investigated signals at positive SNRs, which was achieved using time compressed and low-pass filtered speech.

Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","output":"Atencin farmacutica al paciente externo durante la pandemia COVID-19.

However, the impact of this mobility and the transmission of the virus due to local travel, compared to the population traveling across state boundaries, is unknown. This study evaluates the impact of local vs. visitor mobility in understanding the growth in the number of cases for infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: We use two different mobility metrics, namely the local risk and visitor risk extracted from trip data generated from anonymized mobile phone data across all 50 states in the United States. We analyzed the impact of just using local trips on infection spread and infection risk potential generated from visitors' trips from various other states. We used the Diebold-Mariano test to compare across three machine learning models. Finally, we compared the performance of models, including visitor mobility for all the three waves in the United States and across all 50 states. Results: We observe that visitor mobility impacts case growth and that including visitor mobility in forecasting the number of COVID-19 cases improves prediction accuracy by 34. We found the statistical significance with respect to the performance improvement resulting from including visitor mobility using the Diebold-Mariano test. We also observe that the significance was much higher during the first peak March to June 2020. Conclusion: With presence of cases everywhere (i.e. local and visitor), visitor mobility (even within the country) is shown to have significant impact on growth in number of cases. While it is not possible to account for other factors such as the impact of interventions, and differences in local mobility and visitor mobility, we find that these observations can be used to plan for both reopening and limiting visitors from regions where there are high number of cases.","output":"COVID-19: Examining the case growth-rate due to Visitor vs Local Mobility using Machine Learning: A Study in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, virus infections are responsible for many diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality.

The compressed k-mer groups (CKGs), identified by the simhash method, contain k-mers with similar abundance profiles and serve as the cells features. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG features lend themselves to better performance than gene expression features in scRNA-seq classification accuracy in the majority of experimental cases.

Rsultats Quatorze patients sjournant au moins trois jours et 16 PS travaillant rgulirement dans lunit REB ont t interrogs. Respectivement 8/8 et 1/6 patients avec ou sans prcautions disolement (pour diffrentes raisons), ont exprim une reprsentation ngative de la chambre, avec un sentiment demprisonnement, de stigmatisation et de mfiance. Ils ont galement signal un manque dinformations de la part du PS et un besoin de divertissement, dactivits et de visites de proches. Les PS naimaient pas travailler dans cette unit en raison des contraintes techniques des sas et du manque de contact facile avec les patients, et dun sentiment de danger de travailler dans ces units malgr lutilisation dinterphones. Conclusion Placer un patient dans une chambre REB affecte non seulement ses motions, mais galement les PS,  la fois motionnellement et dans leur organisation de soins. Des systmes dalerte, un interphone et les systmes de visioconfrence peuvent amliorer la s?ret et la scurit ainsi que les changes avec le patient et ses proches.

The designed PCR has 2 temperature zones. In fact, in this PCR, the second and third stages of the experiment are merged inside one temperature zone. In the first step, a proper design based on genetic studies is considered. Then, to find the location of the heaters, the system is numerically studied via COMSOL Multiphysics. The designed PCR in this study has 2 temperature zones of 95 and 60 centigrade. After that, the heat transfer analysis is validated. The dimensions of the chip are 80 mm in length and width and 7 mm in height. There are 64 channels on the chip which means the PCR has 32 cycles. The length of each microchannel is 33 mm and each temperature cycle is 68 mm. The width of the microchannels is 500 mm and the depth of it is 400 m (following Mohr et al. study (30)). Different methods for fabrication of the microchannel has been used, which in the end, laser engraving was chosen. Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) is used for the bonding. Also, the thickness of the cap is considered 2 mm to strengthen the chip. Heater and Peltier (thermoelectric cooler) is used to reach the desired temperatures. The reason to use the Peltier is that the 95 centigrade zone can affect the 60 centigrade zone which increases the temperature at this zone. A PID controller is used to control the temperatures. The main advantage of this research is the very fast, easy, and low-cost method for producing PCR chips. It can be useful in critical situations, such as COVID-19 pandemic conditions where there is an urgent need for PCR chips to diagnose this disease.","output":"Novel Fabrication Method of a Microfluidic Continuous Flow PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeting type I interferon immune responses is a potential strategy for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.

In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

In order to characterize the structure of these antigenic sites, we constructed a series of cDNA clones encoding deleted or truncated S1 derivatives and expressed the modified genes in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. Monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes A and B recognized only the mutant S1 polypeptides containing amino acids 324C720, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in the absence of -mercaptoethanol. In addition, two domains within this region were identified and only mutants containing both domains were immunoreactive, indicating that both were critical in the formation of the antigenic determinants. One domain was localized between residues 324 and 403 and the other at residues 517C720. Deletion of either domain inhibited extracellular secretion of the mutant proteins whereas mutants containing both or none of the domains were secreted efficiently. This observation suggests a vital function of the native conformation of the S1 protein in both antigenic structure and intracellular transport. Antigenic determinants A and B were not distinguished, but these determinants appeared to require both domains for epitope formation. Our results suggest that the antigenic determinants formed by two domains are likely associated with the probable polymorphic region of the BCV S1 subunit.","output":"Structural analysis of the conformational domains involved in neutralization of bovine coronavirus using deletion mutants of the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit expressed by recombinant baculoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work investigates tolerance and control solutions to a two-sided interval linear system.

Access to safe drinking water, in particular, is critical to one's health and, by extension, one's income and well-being. Underground wells are the primary supply of drinking water in the Niger Delta, and the groundwater is not always treated before consumption. As a result, water continues to be a vital environmental component that affects both humans and other life forms. Objectives: The aims of the research is to trace the sources and affecting factors of groundwater pollution via statistical and multivariate statistical techniques. Method: The investigation made use of standard analytical procedures. All sampling, conservation, transportation and analysis followed standard procedures described in APHA (2012). To prevent degradation of the organic substances, all obtained samples were transferred to the laboratory, while keeping in an icebox. Results: The study reveals that the greater the number of principal components extracted the greater variation in geochemical composition of the ground waters. It indicated that 34 parameters were distributed into six (6) and nine (9) principal components (PCs) extracted for groundwater samples for both rainy and dry seasons, potentially suggesting the input of different pollutants from different sources. Gas flaring, mineral dissolution/precipitation and anthropogenic input are the main sources of the physicochemical indices and trace elements in the groundwater. Groundwater chemistry is predominantly regulated by natural processes such as dissolution of carbonates, silicates, and evaporates and soil leaching, followed by human activities. Climatic factors and land use types are also important in affecting groundwater chemistry. Conclusion: Greater efforts should be made to safeguard groundwater, which is hampered by geogenic and anthropogenic activities, in order to achieve sustainable groundwater development. As a result, communities are recommended to maintain a groundwater management policy to ensure long-term sustainability. The study is useful for understanding groundwater trace sources in Rivers State's Ebocha-Obrikom districts. Such understanding would enable informed mitigation or eradication of the possible detrimental health consequences of this groundwater, whether through its use as drinking water or indirectly through consumption of groundwater-irrigated crops. As a result, determining its primary probable source of pollution (MPSP) is critical since it provides a clearer and more immediate interpretation. Furthermore, the research findings can be used as a reference for groundwater pollution prevention and water resource protection in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.","output":"STATISTICAL AND MULTIVARIATE TECHNIQUES TO TRACE THE SOURCES OF GROUND WATER CONTAMINANTS AND AFFECTING FACTORS OF GROUNDWATER POLLUTION IN AN OIL AND GAS PRODUCING WETLAND IN RIVERS STATE, NIGERIA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background School-based COVID-19 testing is a potential strategy to facilitate the safe reopening of schools that have been closed due to the pandemic.

Results Findings indicated similarities and differences in attitudes toward in-school COVID-19 testing. All groups agreed that frequent in-school COVID-19 testing could increase the actual safety and perceived safety of the school environment. School administrators and teachers expressed pessimism about the financial cost and logistics of implementing a testing program. Parents supported frequent testing but expressed concerns about physical discomfort and stigma for students who test positive. Teachers and parents noted that testing would prevent parents from sending sick children to school. Students were in favor of testing because it would allow them to return to in-person school after a difficult year of online learning.

However, the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban in the real-world setting, outside of the strict protocols used by randomized clinical trials, are unknown. METHODS This was a prospective, observational, noninterventional, phase IV study of 3914 consecutive patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty from June 2010 to December 2012. Patients were treated with rivaroxaban 10 mg by mouth daily starting postoperative day 1 and continued for 15 days. Participants were followed up in clinic at 6 weeks and contacted by telephone at 12 weeks. The primary outcome of interest was symptomatic venous thromboembolism; secondary outcomes included bleeding events, transfusion requirements, and death. RESULTS The incidence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis at 3 months was 0.5% (n = 18). Only 1 deep venous thrombosis event occurred within 7 days of surgery. The incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) at 3 months was 0.7% (n = 28). Thirteen PEs (46%) occurred within 7 days of surgery. The rate of major bleeding while on prophylaxis was 0.1%. Only 5% of patients received a blood transfusion. No deaths were attributed to thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION This prospective, observational, phase IV study demonstrates that rivaroxaban appears to protect patients against symptomatic PE and is not associated with major bleeding events when used in a real-world setting as described.","output":"A Phase IV Study of Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events Following Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Using Oral Factor Xa Inhibitor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The lung failure for sepsis is reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We previously reported that anisodamine hydrobromide (Ani HBr), an extract from the Chinese herb Anisodus tanguticus (Maxim) Pascher, could alleviate acute kidney injury in septic rats. In this study, we test whether Ani HBr protects against lung injury in septic rats. Adult specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 h or underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery for 24 h, followed by another 24 h treatment of Ani HBr (0, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg) or atropine (5 mg/kg) via tail intravenous injection. Lung injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactic acid (LA), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), CXCL8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), serum and lung tissue levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA), immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of GSDMD and NLRP3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The protective mechanisms of Ani HBr against apoptosis and pyroptosis in lung tissues were examined by detecting the IL-1?, (pro) caspase-1, GSDMD and NLRP3 for pyroptosis, and (pro)caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax for apoptosis by Western Blot, respectively. Results showed that Ani HBr alleviated histopathologic injuries of the lung including inflammatory cell infiltration, and alveolar damages and edema in LPS- and CLP-induced septic rats. Ani HBr suppressed LPS- and CLP-induced CK, LA, LDH, CXCL8 and TNF- in serum. Ani HBr reduced MDA in serum and lung tissue in septic rats, while elevated SOD activity. Ani HBr inhibited the positive cell rate of GSDMD and NLRP3 in lung sections induced by LPS and CLP, and inhibited the GSDMD and NLRP3 expression induced by LPS and CLP. Ani HBr inhibited LPS- and CLP-induced apoptosis in lung tissues. In accordance with the IHC staining results, Ani HBr inhibited expressions of IL-1?, NLRP 3, caspase-1 and GSDMD. The proapoptotic markers including Bax and (pro) caspase 3 were reduced by Ani HBr, and antiapoptotic marker Bcl-2 was increased by Ani HBr. The protective effects of Ani HBr at 5.4 mg/kg were better than 1.8 mg/kg and atropine. Therefore, Ani HBr alleviates acute lung injury in septic rats, which provides evidence supporting the clinical therapy of lung injury by Ani HBr.","output":"Anisodamine hydrobromide protects against acute lung injury in septic rats induced by lipopolysaccharide or cecal ligation and puncture via inhibiting apoptosis and pyroptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION There is limited literature exploring the benefits of interactive wheelchair educational programs in medical student curriculums.

We recently compared two vaccine platforms for preventing genital herpes in female mice and guinea pigs and determined that HSV-2 glycoproteins C, D and E expressed using nucleoside-modified mRNA in lipid nanoparticles provided better protection than the same antigens produced as baculovirus proteins and administered with CpG and alum. Here we evaluated mRNA and protein immunization for protection against neonatal herpes. Female mice were immunized prior to mating and newborns were infected intranasally with HSV-2. IgG binding and neutralizing antibody levels in mothers and newborns were comparable using the mRNA or protein vaccines. Both vaccines protected first and second litter newborns against disseminated infection based on virus titers in multiple organs.

Functional evaluation and measurement of biochemical and echocardiographic parameters occurred before the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, and after 3 months of treatment. RESULTS We identified 52 patients (26 non-ischaemic and 26 ischaemic cardiomyopathy) suitable for treatment with sacubitril/valsartan. Treatment was followed by a significant decrease in a New York Heart Association (NYHA) class in both patients with non-ischaemic (2.3  0.6 vs. 1.6  0.7, P < 0.001) and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (2.3  0.5 vs. 1.5  0.6, P < 0.001), along with an increase in ejection fraction in both patients with non-ischaemic (26.2%  6.5% vs. 37.2%  13.8%, P < 0.001) and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (28.1%  5.7% vs. 31.5%  8.4%, P = 0.007).

As patients suffering from psychiatric disorders were not spared, the Ville-Evrard Public Health Establishment set up a strategy to deal with this crisis by setting up a COVID+ unit specialized in the care of patients suffering from mental disorders and infected by the Coronavirus. Patients diagnosed as positive by PCR test were transferred to this unit so that they could benefit from a global management. Aim of the study: The aim of our work was to focus on psychiatric patients (whether they were carriers of the COVID-19 virus or not) on their experiences during the health crisis in the first wave from March to June 2020, during the first containment. Materials and methods: We have developed a semi-structured questionnaire composed of 8 questions, allowing to explore different aspects of the experience of the health crisis. We interviewed 12 patients (six patients affected by COVID-19 and six unaffected patients) with different mental disorders. The patients expressed themselves freely and their answers to the questions were presented question by question and separated according to the two groups. The first question was intended only for patients in the first cluster infected with the Coronavirus and the second question for patients with a family member infected with the virus. Results: For the first question, two patients among the six infected with the Coronavirus, expressed anxiety. For the second question, two patients in the Covid+ group had a family member who had contracted the virus. One patient felt guilty, and one patient was anxious. In the Covid- group, one patient whose spouse had contracted the virus was very worried. For the third question, in the Covid+ group, four of the six patients were compliant with containment, two patients were not. In the Covid- group, four patients experienced containment between home and the hospital, and two patients experienced the entire containment at home. Regarding the fourth question, all patients (in both groups) acknowledged that the health crisis had a significant impact on their lifestyle. In response to the fifth question, all patients in the Covid+ group talked about their stay in the COVID+ unit and its setting. For patients in the Covid- group, the answers were varied mentioning simple means of distraction. For the sixth question, all patients (in both groups) were globally satisfied with their care. Concerning the seventh question, all patients in the Covid+ group thought they had been sufficiently careful without expressing any fear about the risk of contamination. In the Covid- group, the answers were centered on the fear of contracting the virus in the hospital. The responses to the eighth and final question were marked by a glimmer of hope. Conclusion: In the light of this work, the repercussions of this crisis, during the first wave, were generally well experienced by our patients, in the psychiatric environment, with a good awareness of the stakes and the risks incurred but also with a glimmer of hope for a resolution of the situation soon. Finally, most of the psychiatric patients in this sample behaved as respectful citizens during this first wave of confinement.","output":"Regards croiss de patients psychiatriques COVID positifs ou ngatifs sur leur vcu de la crise sanitaire au sein dune unit COVID lors de la premire vague"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the history of dog mess in Paris, from its discovery in the late 1920s to the management regime of the early twenty-first century.

Interestingly, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the nervous system cells like neurons, microglia, and astrocytes has been a factor to worsen COVID-19 through its neuroinflammatory actions. The release of cytokines due to astrocyte and microglial activation could progress towards the most anticipated cytokine storm proving to be detrimental in the management of COVID-19. Such hyper-inflammatory conditions could make the BBB vulnerable, encouraging excessive viral particles into the CNS, leading to further neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Multiple Sclerosis.

In the present study, we describe the construction of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-bearing DENV replicon under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. Following a rational in silico design and cloning by standard molecular biology techniques, a reporter DENV-2 replicon and a replication-deficient mutant were constructed, and characterized by confocal microscopy and real-time RT-PCR. The results showed successful transcription, translation, and autonomous viral RNA replication of the DENV replicon from its DNA clone.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of HRT vs CRT in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at a population level. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Registry-based cohort study from the Australian and New Zealand Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry (PCOR-ANZ). Participants were men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with primary RT (excluding brachytherapy) from January 2016 to December 2019. Data were analyzed in March 2021. EXPOSURES: HRT defined as 2.5 to 3.3 Gy and CRT defined as 1.7 to 2.3 Gy per fraction. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal trends and institutional, clinicopathological, and sociodemographic factors associated with use of HRT were analyzed. PROs were assessed 12 months following RT using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)C26 Short Form questionnaire. Differences in PROs were analyzed by adjusting for age and National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category. RESULTS: Of 8305 men identified as receiving primary RT, 6368 met the inclusion criteria for CRT (n = 4482) and HRT (n = 1886). The median age was 73.1 years (IQR, 68.2-77.3 years), 2.6% (168) had low risk, 45.7% (2911) had intermediate risk, 44.5% (2836) had high-/very highCrisk, and 7.1% (453) had regional nodal disease. Use of HRT increased from 2.1% (9 of 435) in the first half of 2016 to 52.7% (539 of 1023) in the second half of 2019, with lower uptake in the high-/very highCrisk (1.9% [4 of 215] to 42.4% [181 of 427]) compared with the intermediate-risk group (2.2% [4 of 185] to 67.6% [325 of 481]) (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45). Substantial variability in the use of HRT for intermediate-risk disease remained at the institutional level (median 53.3%; range, 0%-100%) and clinician level (median 57.9%; range, 0%-100%) in the last 2 years of the study period. There were no clinically significant differences across EPIC-26 urinary and bowel functional domains or bother scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, use of HRT for prostate cancer increased substantially from 2016. This population-level data demonstrated clinically equivalent PROs and supports the continued implementation of HRT into routine practice. The wide variation in practice observed at the jurisdictional, institutional, and clinician level provides stakeholders with information that may be useful in targeting implementation strategies and benchmarking services.","output":"Evaluation of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Use and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Men With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer in Australia and New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated no effect on the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to answer questions related to the use of hydroxychloroquine for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, adverse events, and mortality. METHODS: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase 3 randomized clinical trials, selected from various databases, which compared patients who received hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis or treatment of mild COVID-19 cases with controls.

The aim of this study is to investigate real adherence to these measures among MS patients and to evaluate its impact on exposure to infection. Methods MS patients followed at the MS centre of Tor Vergata University hospital, Rome, Italy were asked to complete an anonymous 35-items web-survey exploring demographics, residency, employment, social distancing habits, use of PPE, MS features and COVID19 infection data, including self-reported information about contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive person. In order to estimate adherence to social distancing and use of PPE, an overall Lockdown Score (LS) on 0-10 scale was created analyzing four main domains (Working (0 - 4), Social distancing and PPE use (0 - 4), Assistance for shopping needs (0 - 2), Residency (-2 - 0)). Mean scores for several pre-defined subgroups of patients were compared using both univariable and multivariable analyses. Accuracy of the score in discriminating subjects at higher risk of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive individuals was calculated as the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-off was identified and used to dichotomize LS (high/ low). Logistic regression model was applied to estimate the characteristics of individuals associated to high/low LS and the odds ratio of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive individuals based on continous and dichotomised LS. Results Respondents (N=551) had a mean(SD) overall LS of 6.522.11 (Working 3.161.19, Social distancing and PPE use 2.691.33, Assistance 0.66 0.62, Residency penalty applied in 4 cases). Females, disabled and unemployed individuals had significantly higher mean LS (p<0.05). The AUC of the LS was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.77) and the optimal LS cut-off for discrimination was 6.0. Consistently, females, disabled and unemployed individuals had higher odd of getting a high LS ( 6) compared to males, independent and employed (p<0.05). Odd of coming in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive/presumed positive individuals was significantly reduced for one-unit increase in LS (0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85)) and among individuals with high LS (0.37 (95% CI: 0.19-0.72)). Only one subject among respondents declared to have been diagnosed with COVID19. Conclusions MS patients, especially those with social unfavorable conditions, demonstrated good adherence to social distancing and use of protection equipment.

Second, these werent decisions about public health alone. They were also decisions about the quality of education. In person usually turned out to be an untested and primitive form of hybrid instruction that has no track record and has never been used on any scale before. During the pandemic the choice has never been between genuine in person teaching and online teaching. Public health concerns continually put some students online because of contagion risks. The real choice has been between fully online teaching (nobody in a classroom) and simultaneous hybrid teaching (some students in a classroom while others participate online). In many but not all situations, simultaneous hybrid teaching is demonstrably worse than fully online teaching. Third, university administrators who made unilateral decisions about methods of instruction violated basic rules on shared governance under the nationally authoritative 1966 AAUP Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities. The AAUP has already begun investigating some colleges and universities on this basis. And to the extent a universitys unilateral decisions included a law school, the universitys actions also violated the American Bar Associations accreditation standards and the Association of American Law Schools Bylaws. A law school needs ABA accreditation for its graduates to take the bar exam, and nearly all law schools are AALS members.

Given the variability in COVID-19 testing and prevention capability, identifying factors associated with mortality in patients requiring mechanical ventilation is critical. This study aimed to identify which demographics, comorbidities, markers of disease progression, and interventions are associated with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to one of the health systems intensive care units and requiring mechanical ventilation between March 9, 2020 and April 1, 2020, were included in this observational cohort study. We used Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare patient characteristics between deceased and living patients and multiple logistic regression to assess the association between independent variables and the likelihood of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 85 patients, of which 20 died (23.5%) within 30 days of the first hospital admission. In the univariate analysis, deceased patients were more likely 60 years of age (p < 0.001), non-Hispanic (p = 0.026), and diagnosed with a solid malignant tumor (p = 0.003). Insurance status also differed between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.019). Age 60 and malignancy had a 9.5-fold (95% confidence interval 1.4-62.3, p = 0.020) and 5.8-fold higher odds ratio (95% confidence interval 1.2-28.4, p = 0.032) for 30-day mortality after adjusted analysis using multivariable logistic regression, while other independent variables were no longer significant.

Reflecting on our students feedback during this time, we noted continued praise for clinical simulation opportunities, even with social distancing modifications, but less enthusiasm for virtual teaching sessions, which risk being more didactic in nature. Students also report more limited opportunities to clerk paediatric patients due to fewer paediatric admissions during the pandemic.Concurrent to this change in education style, our own clinical practice has become increasingly virtual, with the vast majority of our clinics being telephone or video-based. Todays doctors have adapted to virtual clinics with minimal preparation or training.Keen to make our online teaching more interactive, we sought to provide tomorrows doctors with structured training in leading virtual consultations.ObjectivesTo deliver simulated telephone consultation training to medical students with the aims of:Improving student confidence in leading virtual consultations.Reinforcing paediatric history-taking skills.Stimulating discussion about common paediatric clinical presentations.MethodsMedical students undertaking their paediatric placement in our department attend simulated telephone consultation sessions. Using a video-conferencing platform, one student takes a history from a simulated parent of a paediatric patient, whose camera is off to better simulate a telephone consultation. Observing students use an Active Attendance in Telephone Clinic proforma to encourage them to reflect on both the communication skills and the clinical problem. A subsequent discussion between the students and facilitators enables reflection on the strengths and challenges of the consultation and the patients clinical presentation.To gather data on the effectiveness of these simulations, students complete pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. Feedback from each simulation informs the development of subsequent sessions.ResultsOur experience of this educational method has been very positive. Prior to their first telephone simulation session, students have had minimal experience of virtual simulation and, whilst students recognise the relevance of virtual consultation training, they report lack of confidence in leading virtual consultations. Feedback following simulation has highlighted an improvement in students confidence both in paediatric history-taking and in leading virtual consultations. Students have requested further telephone simulations and have highlighted the strength of not trying to simulate a traditional clinic environment but instead embracing the opportunity to learn virtual communication skills.As educators, we have enjoyed providing a more interactive form of virtual teaching. We continue to refine these sessions, building on our experience of previous simulations. Modifications have included: clearer structuring of sessions, tighter time management and increasing the nuance of each clinical scenario to pose interesting clinical challenges for our students.ConclusionsSimulated telephone consultations are a simple way of improving student participation in small group online teaching sessions, affording opportunities for students to hone their history-taking skills under senior clinician supervision, stimulating scenario-based clinical discussions and helping prepare the next generation of doctors to work in an increasingly virtual world.","output":"Telephone consultation simulations: making the most of virtual teaching during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Homeless people often suffer from complex and chronic comorbidities, have high rates of morbidity and die at much younger ages than the general population. Due to a complex combination of physical, psychosocial and addiction problems at the end of life, they often have limited access to palliative care. Both the homeless and healthcare providers experience a lot of barriers. Therefore, providing palliative care that fits the needs and concerns of the homeless is a challenge to healthcare providers. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence about the concerns, palliative care needs and preferences of homeless people, as well as barriers and facilitators for delivering high quality palliative care. METHODS PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched up to 10 May 2016. Included were studies about homeless people with a short life expectancy, their palliative care needs and the palliative care provided, that were conducted in Western countries. Data were independently extracted by two researchers using a predefined extraction form. Quality was assessed using a Critical Appraisal instrument. The systematic literature review was based on the PRISMA statement. RESULTS Twenty-seven publications from 23 different studies met the inclusion criteria; 15 studies were qualitative and eight were quantitative. Concerns of the homeless often related to end-of-life care not being a priority, drug dependence hindering adequate care, limited insight into their condition and little support from family and relatives. Barriers and facilitators often concerned the attitude of healthcare professionals towards homeless people.

Medication adherence interventions are sometimes ineffective for African Americans because their unique illness perceptions are not adequately addressed. The Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R) that assesses illness perceptions has shown reliability and validity problems when used with African Americans. Thus, the study objective was to adapt the IPQ-R for African Americans and assess the validity and reliability of the culturally adapted questionnaire. METHODS: The parent study used an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, to explore African Americans illness perceptions qualitatively, used the results to adapt the IPQ-R, and tested the culturally adapted IPQ-R items quantitatively. In this paper, a preliminary culturally adapted IPQ-R refined based on the qualitative study, was administered to 170 middle-aged United States-based African Americans with type 2 diabetes in a face-to-face survey. Content, construct, convergent, and predictive validity, including reliability was examined. Pearson and item-total correlations, item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and test-retest were conducted. RESULTS: A revised culturally adapted IPQ-R was identified with a 9-factor structure and was distinct from the old factor structure of the original IPQ-R. The consequences domain from the IPQ-R occurred as two factors (external and internal consequences) while the emotional representations domain in the IPQ-R emerged as separate present and future emotional representation factors. Illness coherence was differently conceptualized as illness interpretations to capture additional culturally adapted items within this domain. Most items had factor loadings greater than 0.4, with moderate factor score correlations. Necessity and concern beliefs in medicines significantly correlated with domains of the culturally adapted IPQ-R. Pearsons correlation values were not greater than 0.7, indicating good convergent validity. The culturally adapted IPQ-R significantly predicted medication adherence. None of the correlation values were higher than 0.7 for the test-retest, indicating moderate reliability. Most domains of the culturally adapted IPQ-R had Cronbachs alpha values higher than 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary support for the validity of the culturally adapted IPQ-R in African Americans with diabetes, showing good construct, convergent and predictive validity, as well as reliability.

Ein Verst?ndnis von Pandemie und Pandemie-Bek?mpfung ist jedoch auf der Basis eines liberalen Freiheitsbegriffs nicht angemessen m?glich, der Unfreiheit erst mit der staatlichen Intervention entstehen sieht. Die Freiheits-Frage stellt sich aber bereits beim Ausbruch der Pandemie, also vor aller staatlichen Intervention. Pandemie als sozio-naturaler Zustand ist per se Unfreiheit. Stattdessen ist ein sozialstaatliches Freiheitsverst?ndnis zu entwickeln, das es erlaubt, staatliche Intervention zun?chst als Reaktion auf einen Zustand der Unfreiheit zu verstehen. Der Beitrag analysiert detailliert das Spektrum m?glicher Formen gesellschaftlicher und politischer Steuerung in Zeiten der Covid-19-Pandemie. Der in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland eingeschlagene Weg staatlich-appellativer Steuerung konkurriert mit Steuerungsmodellen einer Diskriminierung nach Risikogruppen und einer digitalen Pr?ventionsstaatlichkeit, beide mit bedenklichen Folgen fr die Freiheit des Einzelnen. Eine angemessene Steuerungsform, die auch Umstellung der Infektionsschutzpolitik von einer polizeirechtlichen zu einer sozialpolitischen Regulierung impliziert, muss auf ein sozialstaatlich ausgerichtetes Verst?ndnis von Freiheit gegrndet werden, das seine letztliche Verankerung im Begriff sozialer Freiheit hat. In the Covid-19 pandemic, the concept of freedom is often placed against a state, which, for reasons of infection control, seriously interferes in the organization of citizens' everyday lives. The debate on freedom is expected to determine the extent to which state measures can be legitimized. An understanding of pandemic and pandemic control is not adequately possible on the basis of a liberal concept of freedom, which sees a lack of freedom as resulting solely from state intervention. The question of freedom, however, arises at the outbreak of the pandemic, before any state intervention. Pandemic as a socio-natural condition is per se a lack of freedom. Instead, a concept of welfare state freedom must be developed that allows to understand state intervention initially as a reaction to a state of unfreedom. The article analyzes in detail the spectrum of possible forms of social and political governance in times of the Covid-19 pandemic. The path of governmental-appellative governance adopted in the Federal Republic of Germany competes with governance models of discrimination according to risk groups and a digital prevention state, both with alarming consequences for the freedom of the individual. An appropriate form of governance, which also implies an institutional restructuring of infection control policy, must be based on an understanding of freedom that has its horizon in a concept of social freedom.","output":"Covid-19-Pandemie und soziale Freiheit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoparticles may be used in vaccinology as an antigen delivery and/or an immunostimulant to enhance immunity.

Monte Carlo simulations were applied to calculate risks associated with twenty elements. We attempted different probability distribution functions for concentrations because the actual distribution functions are not known, and the only data available are the mean value and standard deviation of concentrations obtained from experiment. Our results indicate that the total non-carcinogenic health risk through exposure to different elements (Hazardous Index, HI) does not strongly depend on the choice of the probability distribution function for the concentrations. We also show that taking into account probability distributions of other variables and parameters such as body weight, exposed skin area, skin adhesion, etc. does not significantly change the main result rather just slightly broadening the final Hazardous Index distribution function.

MIS-C and CLL serum samples displayed decreased NET degradation ability, in association with C1q and G-actin or anti-NET antibodies, respectively, but not with genetic variants of DNases. In adult COVID-19, persistent elevations in NETs post-disease diagnosis were detected but did not occur in asymptomatic infection. COVID-19-affected adults displayed significant prevalence of impaired NET degradation, in association with anti-DNase1L3, G-actin, and specific disease manifestations, but not with genetic variants of DNases. NETs were detected in many organs of adult patients who died from COVID-19 complications. Infection with the Omicron variant was associated with decreased levels of NETs when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 strains. These data support a role for NETs in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult patients.","output":"Multicenter analysis of neutrophil extracellular trap dysregulation in adult and pediatric COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case study of GP Shared Care provides an interesting lens though which to view the current opportunities for improved healthcare partnerships as we respond to the COVID-19 challenges.","output":"COVID-19: Pump-priming positive healthcare reform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus invasion activates the host's innate immune response, inducing the production of numerous cytokines and interferons to eliminate the pathogens. Except for viral DNA/RNA, viral proteins are also target of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Membrane-bound receptors TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6 and TLR10 relate to the recognition of viral proteins. Distinct TLRs perform both protective and detrimental roles to specific virus. Here, we review viral proteins serving as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and their corresponding Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These viruses are all enveloped, including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus, herpesvirus human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus, which can encode proteins to activate innate immunity in a TLR-dependent way.

DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library electronic databases from inception through June 2020 was performed. There were no language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION The PRISMA strategy was followed. Included studies discuss USH patients who underwent CI regardless of age, nationality, or clinical subtype. All included studies report post-implantation functional, cognitive, or quality of life outcomes. Only reviews were excluded. RESULTS Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. USH patients experienced improvements in PTA and speech perception and expression outcomes after CI, as well as improvements in phonological memory and quality of life measures. Overall, patients implanted at younger ages outperformed older patients in audiological testing. Similarly, patients with prolonged auditory deprivation had relatively poor performance outcomes in sentence recognition and speech detection following CI. CONCLUSIONS Most USH patients benefit from CI. USH patients who undergo CI at younger ages generally achieve better hearing, speech, and cognitive outcomes. CI at older ages can still prove beneficial if appropriate auditory amplification is started at the right time. Further research is warranted to fill the gap in understanding regarding the gene mutations underlying the pathophysiology of USH that have favorable CI outcomes as well as the optimal time to perform CI.","output":"The Outcomes of Cochlear Implantation in Usher Syndrome: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging literature on the novel coronavirus pandemic has reported several cases of varied retinal findings in patients with COVID-19.

While important research has been conducted, much remains to be known. In Bangladesh, initial treatment (self-administered, hospitalized), persistent COVID-19 symptoms (long COVID-19), and whether COVID-19 leads to changes in mental state, such as depressive symptoms, of people are not known. This study aimed to examine treatment, persistent symptoms, and depression in people who had been infected with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1002 individuals infected with COVID-19 (60% male; mean age = 34.7  13.9; age range = 18C81 years), with data taken over a one-month period (11 September 2020 to 13 October 2020). A self-reported online questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographics, lifestyle, COVID-19 symptoms (during and beyond COVID-19), medication (over-the-counter or doctor-prescribed), and depression (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)). Results: Twenty-four percent of participants self-medicated with over-the-counter medicine when they were first diagnosed with COVID-19. Self-medication was higher among female vs. male respondents (29.6% vs. 20.2%, respectively, p = 0.002). A minority (20%) reported that they experienced persistent COVID-like symptoms after recovering from COVID-19. The most reported persistent symptoms were diarrhea (12.7%) and fatigue (11.5%). Forty-eight percent of participants were categorized as having moderate to severe depression. Based on multivariate regression analysis, depression during COVID-19 was positively associated with lower family income, poor health status, sleep disturbance, lack of physical activity, hypertension, asthma/respiratory problems, fear of COVID-19 re-infection, and persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (CINHAL, MEDLINE and Scopus) were searched to identify primary studies up to April 2021. METHODS: Papers reporting qualitative or quantitative studies exploring the subjective experience and/or preferences of nurses around shift patterns were considered, with no restrictions on methods, date or setting. Key study features were extracted including setting, design and results. Findings were organised thematically by key features of shift work. RESULTS: 30 relevant papers were published between 1993 and 2021. They contained mostly qualitative studies where nurses reflected on their experience and preferences around shift patterns. The studies reported on three major aspects of shift work: shift work per se (i.e. the mere fact of working shift), shift length, and time of shift. Across all three aspects of shift work, nurses strive to deliver high quality of care despite facing intense working conditions, experiencing physical and mental fatigue or exhaustion. Preference for or adaptation to a specific shift pattern is facilitated when nurses are consulted before its implementation or have a certain autonomy to self-roster. Days off work tend to mitigate the adverse effects of working (short, long, early or night) shifts. How shift work and patterns impact on experiences and preferences seems to also vary according to nurses personal characteristics and circumstances (e.g. age, caring responsibilities, years of experience). CONCLUSIONS: Shift patterns are often organised in ways that are detrimental to nurses health and wellbeing, their job performance, and the patient care they provide. Further research should explore the extent to which nurses preferences are considered when choosing or being imposed shift work patterns. Research should also strive to better describe and address the constraints nurses face when it comes to choice around shift patterns.","output":"Nurses experiences and preferences around shift patterns: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM OF THE STUDY: In the context of the worldwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19, France has been deploying multiple sites for mass vaccination. This study aimed to assess the perceived usefulness of a prototype decontamination mobile unit (UMDEO) for COVID-19 vaccination among both the patient and healthcare providers perspectives. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Toulouse over two days. UMDEO is a fully comprehensive, versatile solution that was deployed as a 5-row vaccination unit. A written questionnaire was distributed from March 6(th)-7(th), 2021 among all patients presenting for vaccination at the mobile center, as well as the team participating in the vaccination campaign. RESULTS: Among the vaccinated patients (n=1659), 1409 participants (84.9%) filled out the survey, as well as 68 out of 85 (80%) within the UMDEO team. The maximum patient rate was 98 people per hour. The majority of participants and caregivers (1307 [93.2%] and 67 [98.5%] respectively) agreed that the mobile unit increased access to vaccination. A total of 91.3% patients (n=1281) and 95.6% caregivers (n=65) believed that it would speed up the overall vaccination campaign. CONCLUSION: The majority of the vaccinated population and of the team participating in the survey were satisfied with the usefulness of UMDEO as a vaccination center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed on 394 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients should have a history of hospitalization at Loghman-Hakim hospital, Tehran, Iran, for 10 weeks, beginning from the first official report of the disease in Iran. In the subsequent step, the baseline demographic and clinical and paraclinical information of the patients was documented. Finally, the patients were assessed if they had exhibited any morbidity or mortality. RESULTS: The epidemiological examination of the COVID-19 population suggested a bell diagram pattern for the hospitalization rate, in which the 4th week of the study was the peak. The highest rate of secondary adverse events due to the virus was observed at the 6th and 7th weeks of the study course. On another note, clinical evaluations resulted in identifying specific abnormalities, such as bilateral opacity in chest computed tomography scans or low oxygen saturation in laboratory data.

Given the Condorcet Jury Theorem, individual virtue signallers need not be very reliable for the majority judgment to be very likely to be correct. Thus, even people who are skeptical of the judgments of individual virtue signallers should think that if a majority of them judge that a proposition is true, then that provides significant evidence that the proposition is true. We argue that this is mistaken. Various empirical studies converge on the following point: humans are very conformist in the contexts in which virtue signalling occurs. And stereotypical virtue signallers are even more conformist in such contexts. So we should be skeptical of the claim that virtue signallers are sufficiently independent for the Condorcet Jury Theorem to apply. We do not seek to decisively rule out the relevant application of the Condorcet Jury Theorem. But we do show that careful consideration of the available evidence should make us very skeptical of that application. Consequently, a defense of virtue signalling would need to engage with these findings and show that despite our strong tendencies for conformism, our judgements are sufficiently independent for the Condorcet Jury Theorem to apply.

The individual nutritional status, though usually ignored in the management of COVID-19, plays a critical role in the immune function and pathogenesis of infection. Accordingly, the present review article aimed to report the effects of nutrients and nutraceuticals on respiratory viral infections including COVID-19, with a focus on their mechanisms of action. Methods: Studies were identified via systematic searches of the databases including PubMed/ MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar from 2000 until April 2020, using keywords. All relevant clinical and experimental studies published in English were included. Results: Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is common in severe respiratory infections and should be considered in the management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, obesity can be accompanied by decreasing the host immunity. Therefore, increasing physical activity at home and a slight caloric restriction with adequate intake of micronutrients and nutraceuticals are simple aids to boost host immunity and decrease the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Conclusion: The most important nutrients which can be considered for COVID-19 management are vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin A, folate, zinc, and probiotics. Their adequacy should be provided through dietary intake or appropriate supplementation. Moreover, adequate intake of some other dietary agents including vitamin E, magnesium, selenium, alpha linolenic acid and phytochemicals are required to maintain the host immunity.","output":"Nutritional approach for increasing public health during pandemic of COVID-19: A comprehensive review of antiviral nutrients and nutraceuticals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has impacted life for people throughout the world, especially for those in health care who experience unique stressors.

Data available in the literature reported a potential increased risk of fatal arrhythmias under these therapies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of these drugs on QT interval and outcome in a COVID-19 population. METHODS: A total of 112 consecutive COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis and were divided in 3 groups according to the receiving therapeutic regimens: 19 (17%) patients in Group 1 (no treatment), 40 (36%) in Group 2 (HCQ only), 53 (47%) in Group 3 (HCQ/AZT). RESULTS: A prolonged QTc interval was found in 61% of patients treated with HCQ alone or in combination with AZT, but only 4 (4%) patients showed a QTc > 500 ms. HCQ/AZT combination determined a greater increase of QTc duration compared to the other two strategies (Group 3452  26.4 vs Group 2436.3  28.4 vs Group 1424.4  24.3 ms, respectively; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HCQ/AZT combination (OR 9.02, p = 0.001) and older age (OR 1.04, p = 0.031) were independent predictors of QTc prolongation. The risk increased with age (incremental utility analysis p = 0.02). Twenty patients (18%) died, and no cardiac arrest neither arrhythmic fatalities were documented. CONCLUSIONS: The HCQ/AZT combination therapy causes a significantly increase of QT interval compared to HCQ alone. Older patients under such regimen are at higher risk of experiencing QT prolongation.

The conclusions of the reviews showed conflicting results. Despite this unclear evidence, antipsychotics, in particular, haloperidol is often the recommended pharmacological intervention for delirium in ICU patients. The objective of this overview of reviews is to critically assess the evidence of reviews of randomised clinical trials on the effect of pharmacological management and prevention of delirium in ICU patients.

The assessment is carried out through a structural microsimulation approach, using a dynamic model of savings, labor supply, household formation, and marital status. We find that while the plan would be highly effective at increasing marriage rates, it would reduce child poverty at the expense of increasing poverty among single-mother families and deep child poverty.

PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A case-control study of 70 women with POI matched by age and body mass index with 70 controls. MEASUREMENTS: All were submitted to whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to analyse body composition. In the POI group, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, transaminases and C-reactive protein levels were measured, as well as the thickness of the carotid artery intima-media complex. RESULTS: Total mass, fat mass, lean mass (total, percentage and index) and the android/gynoid (A/G) ratio were similar in both groups; however, bone mineral content was lower (P < .001) in the POI group. Lean and fat mass indexes were 14.19  1.63 and 11.04  3.58, respectively, and the percentage of gynoid to android fat was higher (51.17  6.71% versus 47.74  9.19%; A/G ratio = 0.93  0.15) in the POI group. In addition, the increase in total mass correlated positively with glucose and ALT levels and negatively with HDL-cholesterol. Increased A/G ratio was the measurement most frequently associated with cardiovascular risk markers. CONCLUSION: The body composition of women with POI using hormone therapy is similar to that of women with normal ovarian function with regard to lean and fat mass content and fat distribution. In women with POI, the higher the A/G ratio, the worse the cardiovascular risk markers.","output":"Body composition in women with premature ovarian insufficiency using hormone therapy and the relation to cardiovascular risk markers: A case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown our rheumatology service provided follow up by phone.

However, as testing for the virus had been flawed at that time, U.S. infectious disease experts were skeptical about the reports of second COVID-19 infections. New reports have addressed the urgent need to conduct large-scale studies to better understand the potential recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some case studies show possible reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in a family cluster. Given this consideration, major space stressors such as microgravity and space radiation and their interactions which are not fully known, so far can increase the risk of reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in future space missions, an event that can easily impact the success of any space mission. Since about 80% of infected people are either asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, in a near future, it would be likely that astronauts who start their mission even after complex medical examinations, experience reactivation of the virus during their mission. Moreover, we have previously addressed the potential higher fatality of COVID-19 infections in space due to 1) uselessness of social distancing due to microgravity 2) immune system dysregulation 3) possibly higher mutation rates of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a RNA virus 4) higher risk of reactivation of the virus 5) existence of strong selective pressure and 6) decreased maximum oxygen uptake.","output":"Can Reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 Decrease the Chance of Success of Future Deep Space Missions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Educational training in professional programs forms the foundation for how a person problem-solves throughout their career. However, training focused on only one profession ignores the value realized through collaborations among multiple professions for solving health-related problems.

Effective IPE programs can result in inter-professional collaboration and translation science endeavors across the health sciences and beyond. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid crisis highlight the importance of veterinary medicine in advancing One Health through IPE. The prevalence of IPE programs in veterinary curricula, and the process by which these have been established, has not been widely described in the literature. Through an 18-question survey sent to associate deans (ADs) of 50 veterinary schools, we sought to determine the status of IPE in the veterinary curriculum. Thirty-nine schools agreed to participate, representing primarily United States (US) DVM public and private programs with some representation from Canadian, United Kingdom (UK), and Australasian programs. Schools that provide IPE courses developed their programs in collaboration with other health sciences programs across the 4-year curriculum. The perceived barriers for IPE offerings were no different between schools with or without opportunities; however, a lack of faculty and student-perceived value and lack of adequate space in the academic schedule were common threads.

Inflammation in obese subjects is closely related to ID. It induces reduced iron absorption correlated to the inhibition of duodenal ferroportin expression, parallel to the increased concentrations of hepcidin. Obese subjects often get decreased inflammatory response after bariatric surgery, accompanied by decreased serum hepcidin and therefore improved iron absorption. Bariatric surgery can induce the mitigation or resolution of obesity-associated complications, such as hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting many parameters in the metabolism. However, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy can induce malabsorption and may accentuate ID. The present review explores the burden and characteristics of ID and anemia in obese patients after bariatric surgery, accounting for gastric bypass technique (Roux-en-Y gastric bypassRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).

From March to September 2021, clinical and demographic characteristics were obtained from 1,014 individuals with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and viral variants were identified in a subset of 386 patients. We compared unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated patients, stratifying by age groups. We fitted multivariate statistical models to evaluate the impact of vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 lineages, vaccine types, and clinical parameters. Most hospitalized patients were unvaccinated. In patients over 61 years old, mortality was significantly higher in unvaccinated compared to fully vaccinated individuals. In patients aged 31 to 60 years, vaccinated patients were more likely to be outpatients (46%) than unvaccinated individuals (6.1%). We found immune disease and age above 61 years old as risk factors. While fully vaccination was found as the most protective factor against in-hospital death.

Initial data indicated that TIM3 functioned as a 'co-inhibitory' or 'checkpoint' receptor, but due to the lack of a definable inhibitory signalling motif, it was also suggested that TIM3 might act as a co-stimulatory receptor. Recent studies have shown that TIM3 is part of a module that contains multiple co-inhibitory receptors (checkpoint receptors), which are co-expressed and co-regulated on dysfunctional or 'exhausted' T cells in chronic viral infections and cancer. Furthermore, co-blockade of TIM3 and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) can result in tumour regression in preclinical models and can improve anticancer T cell responses in patients with advanced cancers. Here, we highlight the developments in understanding TIM3 biology, including novel ligand identification and the discovery of loss-of-function mutations associated with human disease.

Telemedicine and telehealth (TM/TH) have been used in obstetrics and gynecology primarily as an adjunct service to the usual care for encounters that require a minimal physical examination. Background: Telemedicine and telehealth are commonly interchangeable terms referring to the provision of clinical services at a distance. Before the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United States (US) was seeing modest but significant growth in the use of TM/TH. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have accelerated the implementation of TM/TH. Review results: Teleradiology, in particular, the use of asynchronous (i.e., store-and-forward) technology, is also used for maternalCfetal medicine consultations. Other TM/TH modalities such as fetal echocardiography, remote fetal monitoring, and remote patient monitoring (RPM) are slowly becoming more popular. Despite the ample benefits of TM/TH, undergraduate and graduate medical training on TM/TH and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) skills have been historically deficient. Multiple challenges remain for the expansion of TM/TH services including regulatory, reimbursement, and licensing policy. For the incorporation of ultrasound in TM/TH visits, a greater infrastructure is needed. Considerations for this infrastructure include rural broadband internet access and modernization of the information technology infrastructure capable of exchanging ultrasound images electronically in a secure and HIPPA-compliant interface. Conclusion: There is ample reason to remain optimistic about the future of TM/TH in the field of ultrasonography and clinical care for obstetrics and gynecology patients. To take advantage of these opportunities, it is imperative that the current challenges to the expansion of TM/TH, including the gaps in the medical education system, be addressed systematically. Clinical and Educational significance: Advances in POCUS, intelligent navigation, and teleoperated ultrasound technology provide a prospect of opportunities to advance TM/TH care while expanding educational opportunities. The most recent expansion of TM/TH after the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to launch TM/TH into a new level of market penetration, making the need for undergraduate and graduate medical education on TM/TH skills ever more relevant.","output":"Telehealth, Ultrasound, and the Physician of the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We retrospectively evaluated the effect of transpulmonary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumours on the lung.

The tumours were either hepatocellular carcinoma (n=14) or liver metastasis (n=12). All 16 liver tumours were undetectable with ultrasonography. The pulmonary function values at 3 months after transpulmonary RFA were compared with baseline (i.e. values before RFA). RESULTS In 8 of 16 sessions, minor pulmonary complications occurred, including small pneumothorax (n=8) and small pleural effusion (n=1). In two sessions, major pulmonary complications occurred, including pneumothorax requiring a chest tube (n=2). These chest tubes were removed at 4 and 6 days, and these patients were discharged 7 and 10 days after RFA, respectively, without any sequelae. The pulmonary function values we evaluated were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) and vital capacity (VC). The mean values of FEV1.0 before and 3 months after RFA were 2.55 l and 2.59 l, respectively; the mean values of VC before and 3 months after RFA were 3.20 l and 3.27 l, respectively.

RESULTS: Overall, 307 (67.9%) patients had relevant limitations in daily life due to the measures. These limitations significantly decreased during the pandemic phases. At the beginning of the pandemic, people complained about restricted social contacts and mobility, which were the most common reasons for perceived limitations in daily life. Later, since June 2020, wearing a mouthCnose mask had become the main reason for perceived limitations. In the elastic net regularisation, model higher perceived limitations in daily life were among others associated with younger age and earlier pandemic phases. Higher psychological burden was mainly associated with early pandemic phase, younger age and depression. The perceived psychological burden decreased as the pandemic phases passed, even though the reasons for psychological burden (anxiety or fear of infection, insecurity and concerns) did not remarkably change during the phases. From 16 June 2020, the patients were asked whether they approve the easing of measures. Sixty-seven of 136 patients (49.3%) approved and 55 (40.4%) did not.

These multi-purpose communication systems serve a variety of capabilities, ranging from passenger convenience communication services, over crew member devices, to maintenance planning. In addition, radio-based sensing enables an efficient sensory basis for state monitoring; e.g., passive seat occupancy detection. Within the scope of the connected aircraft cabin, this article presents a multipath-assisted radio sensing (MARS) approach using the propagation information of transmitted signals, which are provided by the channel impulse response (CIR) of the wireless communication channel. By performing a geometrical mapping of the CIR, reflection sources are revealed, and the occupancy state can be derived.

In order to evaluate the proposed methods, passenger occupancy detection and state detection for the future automation of passenger safety announcements and checks are addressed. Therefore, experimental measurements are performed using commercially available wideband communication devices, both in close to ideal conditions in an RF anechoic chamber and a cabin seat mockup. In both environments, a reliable radio sensing state detection was achieved.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented the first large-scale opportunity to shed light on the mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of CP using modern evidence-based medicine approaches. Studies ranging from observational case series to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported highly variable efficacy results for COVID-19 CP (CCP), resulting in uncertainty. We analyzed variables associated with efficacy, such as clinical settings, disease severity, CCP SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) antibody levels and function, dose, timing of administration (variously defined as time from onset of symptoms, molecular diagnosis, diagnosis of pneumonia, or hospitalization, or by serostatus), outcomes (defined as hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, clinical improvement, or mortality), CCP provenance and time for collection, and criteria for efficacy. The conflicting trial results, along with both recent WHO guidelines discouraging CCP usage and the recent expansion of the FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) to include outpatient use of CCP, create confusion for both clinicians and patients about the appropriate use of CCP. A review of 30 available RCTs demonstrated that signals of efficacy (including reductions in mortality) were more likely if the CCP neutralizing titer was >160 and the time to randomization was less than 9 days.

In the present article, we describe the first transgastric pure NOTES salpingo-oophorectomy, which we call peroral endoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy (POESY). METHODS A woman with BRCA1 mutation presented for prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. We offered her the transgastric approach, having performed more than 25 transgastric appendectomies. After gastroscopic incision in the corpus wall, we advanced the gastroscope into the abdominal cavity. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed with the help of an intrauterine manipulator and a transvaginally introduced 5-mm trocar. The posterior colpotomy was dilated and the specimens were extracted. The gastrotomy was closed with an over-the-scope clip, and the colpotomy with a running suture. RESULTS The gastroscope provided excellent optical control and good tissue preparation. Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed successfully via POESY. The patient recovered quickly and was discharged on the third day, with an uneventful follow-up.

Patients with COPD could have severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this study was to investigate ACE2 regulation by air pollution during the development of COPD. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to unconcentrated traffic-related air pollution for 3 and 6 months. We examined lung injury markers, oxidative stress, inflammation, emphysema, ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) in the lungs after exposure. RESULTS: Lung injury occurred due to an increase in permeability and lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity was observed after 6 months of exposure to fine particulate matter of <1 m in aerodynamic diameter (PM(1)). An (1)-antitrypsin deficiency and neutrophil elastase production with emphysema development were observed after 6 months of PM(1) exposure. 8-isoprostane and interleukin-6 were increased after 3 and 6 months of PM(1) exposure. Caspase-3 was increased after exposure to PM(1) for 6 months. Upregulation of ACE2 was found after 3 months of PM(1) exposure; however, ACE2 had decreased by 6 months of PM(1) exposure. AT1 and AT2 had significantly decreased after exposure to PM(1) for 6 months. Furthermore, smooth muscle hypertrophy had occurred after 6 months of PM(1) exposure.

While azithromycin (AZI) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered similar to placebo in COVID-19, other drugs such as ivermectin (IVER), are being repurposed to treat this pandemic. This study was designed to assess the effects of ivermectin on duration of febrile illness and disease outcomes in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection in a community setting. METHODS: In this case-control study 95 suspected patients of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were included. The controls (Group-A) received AZI+HCQ for seven days while the cases (Group-B) received IVER+AZI+HCQ for six days. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were in Group-B, while 54 patients were in Group-A.

In particular, single stage LGGs are relatively simple in their working principle, as they consist in a pressurized gas reservoir and a barrel with a projectile placed in front of the experiment target. When the shot command is executed, the gas from the reservoir accelerates the projectile through the barrel; in first approximation, its velocity is related to the reservoir pressure, the barrel geometry, and the projectile velocity.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address this issue. DESIGN AND METHODS We searched for randomized trials and cohort studies that evaluated the association between resistance training and mortality and cardiovascular events. Two investigators screened the identified abstracts and full-texts independently and in duplicate. Cochrane tools were used to assess the risk of bias. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using random effect models. RESULTS From the 1430 studies identified, 11 (one randomized trial and 10 cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, totaling 370,256 participants with mean follow-up of 8.85 years. The meta-analysis showed that, compared with no exercise, resistance training was associated with 21% (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)), 0.79 (0.69-0.91)) and 40% (hazard ratio (95% CI), 0.60 (0.49-0.72)) lower all-cause mortality alone and when combined with aerobic exercise, respectively. Furthermore, resistance training had a borderline association with lower cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio (95% CI), 0.83 (0.67-1.03)). In addition, resistance training showed no significant association with cancer mortality. Risk of bias was low to intermediate in the included studies. One cohort study looked at the effect of resistance training on coronary heart disease events in men and found a 23% risk reduction (risk ratio, 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.98).

COVID-19 has caused over 766,000 deaths in the United States. While multiple vaccines have been developed, the occurrence of new variant strains and the low rates of vaccination in some regions threaten the efficacy of these vaccines in keeping the global population safe. Current treatments for patients with severe COVID-19 mainly focus on controlling the immune response or providing organ support, but while most patients recover from the disease, lasting effects may continue to disrupt patient lives and global fatalities remain high. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using a novel antisense molecule as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2. The antisense antiviral, called a nanoligomer, has been developed from Sachi Bioworks' proprietary synthetic nucleic acid-based drug discovery platform. The nanoligomers bind to specific DNA or mRNA sequences and offer high specificity and superior transport into cells. These molecules target the SARS-CoV-2 genome to prevent translation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ubiquitous in all RNA viruses, thus preventing viral replication. These antivirals were assessed for toxicity in mice using intranasal, intraperitoneal, and intravenous administration. Intranasal drug administration maximizes treatment concentration at the respiratory infection site, while intraperitoneal and intravenous administration gives further insight on biodistribution of the compound and responses in other organs. Data shows a favorable safety profile in our murine model. Body weight of mice was unaffected by administration of nanoligomers. Serum parameters and organ histology indicated no changes compared to control mice. Cytokine levels remained largely below the level of detection, suggesting that the nanoligomers did not cause any inflammation or immune response in the mice. Further, biodistribution studies showed high initial bioavailability to the lungs, followed by rapid renal clearance and urinary excretion. The nanoligomers therefore show traits of being a safe therapeutic with favorable bioavailability and desirable clearance post-treatment. The antiviral presented is highly adaptable and the sequence may be adjusted to target new variants of respiratory viruses. The antisense sequence can additionally be designed to target a wide variety of DNA, mRNA, or miRNA, including host sequences linked to severe inflammatory responses to COVID-19. A second nanoligomer we have designed and tested targets a human miRNA that has been shown to be upregulated in patients with severe symptoms in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding this miRNA and preventing its action within the host may prevent damage to the host body caused by the immune response. The ability of these molecules to target either the virus itself or alleviate harmful host responses to infection makes nanoligomers a highly versatile treatment option for COVID-19.","output":"Antisense Molecules Designed to Target SARS-CoV-2 are Nontoxic to the Host in a Murine Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: Favipiravir is a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor antiviral agent used in the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

To date, physiologic descriptions have largely focused on gas exchange and respiratory system compliance, however our anecdotal observations suggested that increased airways resistance also commonly contributed to ARF in C19. Normal inspiratory airways resistance (iRaw) has been reported to be 1 cm H2O/L/sec, while unselected patients with ARDS have been reported to have values closer to 5 cm H2O/L/sec (https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/139.5.1169). Methods: We measured iRaw in a prospective convenience sample of 55 mechanically ventilated patients with C19 in 3 adult ICUs between March and September 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. We collected baseline demographics, date of first positive C19 test, days from intubation until the first captured waveform (see below), gas exchange parameters, inflammatory biomarkers, and 90-day mortality. All C19 medical care including sedation and neuromuscular blockade was determined by the primary team. During measurements of ventilatory mechanics, patients were placed on volume control ventilation 6 ml/kg/PBW, square flow at 60 L/min, and an end-inspiratory hold time of 0.3 seconds. Screen shots of flow-time and pressure-time scalars were captured for later review. iRaw was calculated as peak airway pressure-plateau airway pressure/flow. Results: Patient characteristics are shown in the table. The median iRaw was 12 cm H2O/L/sec (IQR 10-16). iRaw was not significantly different among patients with asthma or COPD compared to those without a history of obstructive airways disease (median 12.5 vs 12 cm H2O/L/sec, respectively, p=0.66). Survival to 90 days among patients with iRaw above 12 cm H2O/L/sec was 68% compared to 60% for patients below 12 cm H2O/L/sec (p=0.58). iRaw did not correlate with CRP, ferritin, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, or static compliance (Cstat). Conclusion: Waveform analysis using a convenience sample of mechanically ventilated patients with ARF due to C19 showed a significant increase in iRaw compared to prior studies done on unselected ARDS patients without C19. Increased iRaw was independent of a history of obstructive airways disease and did not correlate with biomarkers of disease severity nor did it predict mortality. Additional studies will be needed to determine if increased iRaw prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation in C19.","output":"Inspiratory airways resistance in respiratory failure due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we investigate which of the main conditions proposed in the moral responsibility literature are the ones that spell trouble for the idea that Artificial Intelligence Systems (AISs) could ever be full-fledged responsible agents.

Subcompetencies (SCs) are scored on a 5-point scale; level 4 is recommended for graduation. The 2018 Milestones Report found that across subspecialties, not all graduates attain level 4 for every SC. Objective The objective was to describe the number of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows who achieve  level 4 in all 23 SCs at graduation and identify SCs where level 4 is not achieved and factors predictive of not achieving a level 4. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of PEM fellows from 2014 to 2018. Program directors provided milestone reports. Descriptive analysis of SC scores was performed. Subanalyses assessed differences in residency graduation scores, first-year fellowship scores, and the rate of milestone attainment between fellows who did and did not attain  level 4 at graduation. Results Data from 392 fellows were obtained. There were no SCs in which all fellows attained  level 4 at graduation; the range of fellows scoring < level 4 per SC was 7% to 39%. A total of 67% of fellows did not attain  level 4 on one or more SC. While some fellows failed to attain  level 4 on up to all 23 SCs, 26% failed to meet level 4 on only one or two. In 19 SCs, residency graduation and/or first year fellow scores were lower for fellows who did not attain  level 4 at graduation compared to those who did (mean difference = 0.74 points). Among 10 SCs, fellows who did not attain  level 4 at graduation had a faster rate of improvement compared to those who did attain  level 4. Conclusion In our sample, 67% of PEM fellows did not attain level 4 for one or more of the SCs at graduation.

This study aims at clarifying the transmission patterns and the driving mechanism that contributed to the COVID-19 prevalence across the provinces of China. Thus, a new dynamical transmission model is established by an ordinary differential system. The model takes into account the hidden circulation of COVID-19 virus among/within humans, which incorporates the spatial diffusion of infection by parameterizing human mobility. Theoretical analysis indicates that the basic reproduction number is a unique epidemic threshold, which can unite infectivity in each region by human mobility and can totally determine whether COVID-19 proceeds among multiple regions. By validating the model with real epidemic data in China, it is found that (1) if without any intervention, COVID-19 would overrun China within three months, resulting in more than 1.1 billion clinical infections and 0.2 billion subclinical infections;(2) high frequency of human mobility can trigger COVID-19 diffusion across each province in China, no matter where the initial infection locates;(3) travel restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions must be implemented simultaneously for disease control;and (4) infection sites in central and east (rather than west and northeast) of China would easily stimulate quick diffusion of COVID-19 in the whole country.

This is of current importance as many organizations, cities, and states are formulating reopening strategies. Our mechanisms, referred to as group scheduling, are based on partitioning the population into groups and scheduling each group on appropriate days with possible gaps (when all are quarantined). Each group interacts with no other group and, importantly, any person who is symptomatic in a group is quarantined. Specifically, our mechanisms are characterized by three parameters $(g,d,t)$, where $g$ is the number of groups, $d$ is the number of days a group is continuously scheduled, and $t$ is the gap between cycles. We show that our mechanisms effectively trade off economic activity for more effective control of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, we show that the $(2,5,0)$ mechanism, which partitions the population into two groups that alternatively work for five days each, flat lines the number of COVID-19 cases quite effectively, while still maintaining economic activity at 70% of pre-COVID-19 level. We also study mechanisms such as $(2,3,2)$ and $(3,3,0)$ that achieve a somewhat lower economic output (about 50%) at the cost of more aggressive control of the virus; these could be applicable in situations when the disease spread is more rampant in the population.

Gargling and nasal rinse mechanically and chemically wash the mucosal surface in the mouth and nose to prevent the attachment of virus and other pathogens. Mechanically, the difference in concentration causes water to move outside the cell by osmosis, reducing mucus secretion and releasing the virus. Meanwhile, a chemical mechanism occurs when the free iodine in povidone-iodine oxidizes fatty acids and damages the virus cell walls and the respiratory chain of cytosolic enzymes, hence preventing inflammation of the host cell.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a novel population of innate-like lymphocytes involved in inflammatory liver disease, and their potential role in liver failure remains unclear. AIM To investigate alteration of circulating MAIT cells and assess its prognostic value in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver failure. METHODS We recruited 55 patients with HBV-related liver failure, 48 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 40 healthy controls (HCs) from Nantong Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and the percentage and number of circulating MAIT cells were detected by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-7, IL-12p70, IL-18 and interferon- were measured by Luminex assay. RESULTS Circulating MAIT cells were significantly decreased in HBV-related liver failure patients (percentage: 2.00  1.22 vs 5.19  1.27%, P < 0.0001; number: 5.47  4.93 vs 84.43  19.59, P < 0.0001) compared with HCs. More importantly, there was a significant reduction of MAIT cells in patients with middle/late-stage compared with early-stage liver failure. Circulating MAIT cells partially recovered after disease improvement, both in percentage (4.01  1.21 vs 2.04  0.95%, P < 0.0001) and in cell count (17.24  8.56 vs 7.41  4.99, P < 0.0001). The proportion (2.29  1.01 vs 1.58  1.38%, P < 0.05) and number (7.30  5.70 vs 2.94  1.47, P < 0.001) of circulating MAIT cells were significantly higher in the survival group than in the dead/liver transplantation group, and the Kaplan-Meier curve showed that lower expression of circulating MAIT cells (both percentage and cell count) predicted poor overall survival (P < 0.01). Also, the levels of IL-12 (20.26  5.42 pg/mL vs 17.76  2.79 pg/mL, P = 0.01) and IL-18 (1470.05  1525.38 pg/mL vs 362.99  109.64 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) were dramatically increased in HBV-related liver failure patients compared with HCs.

Methods: The ACEI cohort comprised 22,384 patients aged  18 years with a first prescription of ACEI. The comparison angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) cohort consisted of age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched patients at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of lung cancer, which was evaluated using a proportional hazard model. Results: The overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 16.6 and 12.2 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The ACEI cohort had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than the ARB cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]. = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]. = 1.11C1.67).

METHODS We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%).

Globally, all people are at risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus through transmission of airborne bioaerosols. Public health actions, such as wearing a mask, are highly recommended to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases. The appropriate use of masks is necessary for effectively preventing the transmission of airborne bioaerosols. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests washing fabric masks or throwing away disposable masks after they are used. However, people often use masks more than once without washing or disposing them. The prolonged use of a single mask mightas a result of the user habitually touching the maskpromote the spread of pathogens from airborne bioaerosols that have accumulated on the mask. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate how long the living components of bioaerosols can be viable on the masks. Here, we evaluated the viability of airborne Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in bioaerosols filtered on woven and anti-droplet (non-woven) face masks. As a simulation of being simultaneously exposed to sand dust and bioaerosols, the viability rates of bioaerosols that had accumulated on masks were also tested against fine dust and airborne droplets containing bacteria. The bioaerosols survived on the masks immediately after the masks were used to filter the bioaerosols, and the bacteria significantly proliferated after one day of storage. Thereafter, the number of viable cells in the filtered bioaerosols gradually decreased over time, and the viability of B. subtilis in bioaerosols on the masks varied, depending on the mask material used (woven or non-woven). Despite the reduction in viability, bioaerosols containing living components were still found in both woven and anti-droplet masks even after six days of storage and it took nine days not to have found them on masks. The number of viable cells in bioaerosols on masks significantly decreased upon exposure of the masks to fine dust. The results of this study should provide useful information on how to appropriately use masks to increase their duration of effectiveness against bioaerosols.","output":"Viability of Bacillus subtilis Cells in Airborne Bioaerosols on Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recientemente, Carrin et al.

METHODS: Pediatric COVID-19 guidelines applicable to India, published until 30 April 2021, were identified through a systematic search across ten databases. Each was critically appraised for methodological quality using the AGREE-II tool, by at least two appraisers. Median (interquartile range) of the total score and domain-wise scores were calculated, and compared for Indian vs. foreign guidelines, updated vs. original versions of guidelines, and those developed earlier vs. later in the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 62 guidelines was identified. Only 8 (12.9%) were published in India. The overall AGREE-II score ranged from 4.7% to 72.8%; with median (IQR) 37.9% (29.4, 48.6). This suggested overall low(er) methodological quality. The median (IQR) domain-wise scores were as follows: Scope and Purpose 66.7% (58.3, 83.3), Stakeholder Involvement 41.7% (30.6, 83.3), Rigor of Development 23.4% (14.8, 37.5), Clarity of Presentation 59.7% (50.0, 75.0), Applicability 27.1% (18.8, 33.3), and Editorial Independence 8.3% (0.0, 45.8).

This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5  10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (4,336 cases & 623,902 controls). FINDINGS: We detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=031 [95% CI 004-057], P = 0023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 105, [95% CI 092-120], P = 043). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 121, [95% CI 106-138], P = 424  10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 086, [95% CI 073-100], P = 299  10-2) . INTERPRETATION: The strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to (1) a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation and/or (2) due to survival bias of the rs35705950 non-IPF risk allele carriers. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a possible selection bias as an explanation, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.

Few studies have highlighted the prognostic value of blood findings such as lymphopenia, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, LDH, CRP, cardiac troponin, low-density lipoproteins and chest radiographic abnormality. A study of progressions of blood and radiological results may help to identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes. This systematic review aimed to assess the temporal progression of blood and radiology findings of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify articles published for peripheral blood investigation and radiological results of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included in this review. The common laboratory features reported include lymphopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase. For radiological signs, ground-glass opacifications, consolidations, and crazy paving patterns were frequently reported. There is a correlation between lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and biomarkers such as C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase; at a later phase of the disease (more than 7 days since onset of symptoms), lymphopenia worsens while neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels and lactate dehydrogenase levels increase. Frequencies of ground-glass opacifications and ground-glass opacifications with consolidations decrease at a later phase of the disease while that of consolidation and crazy paving pattern rises as the disease progresses. More extensive lung involvement was also seen more frequently in the later phases. CONCLUSION: The correlation between temporal progression and the reported blood and radiological results may be helpful to monitor and evaluate disease progression and severity.","output":"Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infectiona review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Federal exception from informed consent (EFIC) procedures allow studies to enroll patients with time-sensitive, life-threatening conditions when written consent is not feasible. Our objective was to compare enrollment rates with and without EFIC in a trial of tranexamic acid (TXA) for children with hemorrhagic injuries. METHODS We conducted a four-center randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial evaluating TXA in children with severe hemorrhagic brain and/or torso injuries. We initiated the trial enrolling patients without EFIC. After 3 months of enrollment, we met our a priori futility threshold and paused the trial to incorporate EFIC procedures and obtain regulatory approval. We then restarted the trial allowing EFIC if the guardian was unable to provide timely written consent. We used descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of eligible patients approached with and without EFIC procedures. We also calculated the time delay to restart the trial using EFIC. RESULTS We enrolled 1 of 15 (6.7%) eligible patients (0.17 per site per month) prior to using EFIC procedures. Of the 14 missed eligible patients, 7 (50%) were not enrolled because guardians were not present or were injured and unable to provide written consent. After obtaining approval for EFIC, we enrolled 30 of 48 (62.5%) eligible patients (1.34 per site per month). Of these 30 patients, 22 (73.3%) were enrolled with EFIC. Of the 22, no guardians refused written consent after randomization. There were no significant differences in the eligibility rate and patient characteristics enrolled with and without EFIC procedures. Across all sites, the mean delay to restart the trial using EFIC procedures was 12 months. CONCLUSIONS In a multicenter trial of severely injured children, the use of EFIC procedures greatly increased the enrollment rate and was well accepted by guardians.

Then, based on the strengths and weaknesses in development, offer several recommendations for the quality improvement which will serve as a reference for the users and developers of CPG. Introduction: With the development of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the CPGs play an increasingly important role in healthcare decision-making both in China and worldwide. Inclusion criteria: The CPGs that have been used to help the health professionals in the healthcare decision-making were included. Methodology: The China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang databases were searched from 2010 to 2020 for the studies describing the general and methodological characteristics of Chinese CPGs. Comparisons of the methodological characteristics between the groups were conducted using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The M-K test was adopted to identify the monotonically increasing or decreasing trends of methodological characteristics over the timespan. Results: A total of 2,654 CPGs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quantity and quality of the guidelines developed in China have improved over the time span. From 2010 to 2020,the guidelines had differing characteristics and covered a wide range of subjects. In total, 2,318(87.34%) guidelines focused on Western Medicine. Eight (0.30%) had been developed for patient versions of guidelines, 10(0.38%) were tentative guidelines, and 16(0.60%) were rapid advice guidelines. Medical specialty societies (including their branches) (71.1%) were the main guideline makers. The most addressed diseases were neoplasms (14.43%). The target population is mainly adults (84.97%). The methodological quality of consensus-based (CB)-CPGs was obviously lower than evidence-based (EB)-CPGs. Except for the item, recommendations were based on evidence of systematic reviews, there were statistical differences in all other methodological items between the EB-CPGS and CB-CPGS (P < 0.01). Higher methodological quality has been observed in EB-CPGs. All the data relating to the methodological characteristics indicated that higher methodological quality was present in the guidelines using GRADE (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The quantity and quality of the guidelines developed in China have improved between 2010 and 2020.

GJ proteins, connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 47 (Cx47), play a crucial role in production and maintenance of CNS myelin. Cx43 is mainly expressed by astrocytes in the CNS and forms gap junction intercellular communications between astrocytes-astrocytes (Cx43-Cx43) and between astrocytes-oligodendrocytes (Cx43-Cx47). Mutations of these connexin (Cx) proteins cause dysmyelinating diseases in humans. Previously, it has been shown that Cx43 localization and expression is altered due to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 infection both in vivo and in vitro; however, its mechanism and association with loss of myelin protein was not elaborated. Thus, we explored potential mechanisms by which MHV-A59 infection alters Cx43 localization and examined the effects of viral infection on Cx47 expression and its association with loss of the myelin marker proteolipid protein. Immunofluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy confirmed that MHV-A59 used microtubules (MTs) as a conduit to reach the cell surface and restricted MT-mediated Cx43 delivery to the cell membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Cx43--tubulin molecular interaction was depleted due to protein-protein interaction between viral particles and MTs. During acute MHV-A59 infection, oligodendrocytic Cx47, which is mainly stabilized by Cx43 in vivo, was down-regulated, and its characteristic staining remained disrupted even at chronic phase. The loss of Cx47 was associated with loss of proteolipid protein at the chronic stage of MHV-A59 infection.","output":"Microtubule-assisted altered trafficking of astrocytic gap junction protein connexin 43 is associated with depletion of connexin 47 during mouse hepatitis virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some children hospitalized for severe pertussis need intensive care; moreover, some children die because of deterioration alone or in combination with other complications.

In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Subsequent global expansion of dengue infection outbreaks has occurred, with millions of cases yearly, probably from a combination of factors including proliferation of international travel and trade, possibly global climate changes, adaptation of the vectors to new environment, and emergence of a new mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus. Chikungunya virus, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causes a very similar clinical disease but with more prominent arthralgia or arthritis and was originally described in Africa in the 1960s. After a quiescent period of several decades, it reemerged in Africa in 2004 and rapidly spread across the Indian Ocean to involve Asian countries and parts of Europe. However, the past 2 years have seen the emergence of chikungunya virus in the western hemisphere with major outbreaks in the Caribbean and the Americas. Similar to dengue virus, chikungunya virus has adapted to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes which can transmit the disease. Although dengue infection is a more deadly disease especially in young children, chikungunya infection can cause prolonged severe disability and occasionally rare fatalities from encephalitis. No specific treatment is available for either diseases, but development of an effective vaccine for dengue infection is in progress. Until 2007, Zika virus [also transmitted by Aedes species] was associated with only sporadic mild infections in Africa and Asia. In 2007, Zika virus for the first time caused an outbreak beyond Africa and Asia to the Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then Zika virus has spread to French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, and Easter Island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean [Chile] in 2014 and by 2015 to Brazil. By January 2016, it became evident that Zika virus had caused an explosive outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean with over 30 countries affected. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika outbreak a global public health emergency.

Currently, 64% of hospitals are reporting via the electronic laboratory reporting system (automated transmission to public health of reportable laboratory findings). In addition, the number of hospital infection control committee meetings LPHNs were invited to increased 96% during the first 7 years. The LPHNs/HOU participate(d) in 9 joint infection prevention/control projects with hospitals. DISCUSSION The threat of emerging infectious disease, health care-associated infections, and multidrug-resistant organisms is an ongoing challenge. Preventing infectious disease requires innovative approaches to effect and empower hospitals to respond. The LAC DPH LPHN project has proved to be an invaluable resource and key component to enable effective communication/collaboration to improve infection prevention and control strategies/preparedness efforts and protect the public's health from infectious disease.","output":"Liaison Public Health Nurse Project: Innovative Public Health Approach to Combat Infectious Disease in Hospitals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, nonpharmacologic interventions (NPIs) have been the main tool used to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic This includes social distancing measures (closing businesses, closing schools, and quarantining symptomatic persons) and contact tracing (tracking and following exposed individuals) While preliminary research across the globe has shown these policies to be effective, there is currently a lack of information on the effectiveness of NPIs in the United States OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to create a granular NPI data set at the county level and then analyze the relationship between NPI policies and changes in reported COVID-19 cases METHODS: Using a standardized crowdsourcing methodology, we collected time-series data on 7 key NPIs for 1320 US counties RESULTS: This open-source data set is the largest and most comprehensive collection of county NPI policy data and meets the need for higher-resolution COVID-19 policy data Our analysis revealed a wide variation in county-level policies both within and among states (P&lt; 001) We identified a correlation between workplace closures and lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases (P= 004) We found weak correlations between shelter-in-place enforcement and measures of Democratic local voter proportion (R=0 21) and elected leadership (R=0 22) CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first large-scale NPI analysis at the county level demonstrating a correlation between NPIs and decreased rates of COVID-19 Future work using this data set will explore the relationship between county-level policies and COVID-19 transmission to optimize real-time policy formulation","output":"Reduction of COVID-19 Incidence and Nonpharmacologic Interventions: Analysis Using a US County-Level Policy Data Set"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic will continue to threaten our health care systems in the next years. In addition to vaccination there is a need for effective tools for prevention and treatment. Products from natural sources, like standardized plant extracts offer a wide range of antiviral effects and possible applications. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate, whether a sorbitol/lecithin-based throat spray containing concentrated green tea extract (sGTE) interacts with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and additionally is capable to block the virus replication. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The antiviral effect was studied in a VeroE6 cell culture model, including concentration/effect correlations and the biological mechanism of virus blockade, using the Wuhan type of SARS CoV-2 beta- and delta-mutations. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative tannin profile present on the oral mucosa after spray application has been investigated by LC-MS/MS and HPLC-DAD analyses of EGCG and related catechin derivatives. RESULTS: The findings of this study demonstrate, that sGTE has strong neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV-2 resulting in an up to 6,3E+04-fold reduction of infectivity independent from the strain. The type of interaction of sGTE with surface proteins seems to be direct and non-specific concerning the viral surface protein structures and resembles the general non-specific activity of polyphenols. By HPLC-DAD analysis, eight catechins were identified in sGTE, with EGCG and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate as the most abundant ones. The total content of catechin derivatives, calculated as catechin, was 76 g/100 g. LC-MS/MS and HPLC-DAD analyses of throat swabs after application of a sGTE spray have shown that the concentrations of green tea tannins in the pharyngeal mucosa are higher than the effective dose found in the in vitro studies with SARS-CoV-2, even 1 h after the last application. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that sGTE has strong neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV-2 independent from the strain (Wuhan strain, beta- or delta-variants). sGTE might be relevant for reduction of corresponding viral infections when periodically applied to mouth and throat.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of polyphenols in a special green tea extract preparation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives : In previous influenza pandemics, bacterial co-infections have been a major cause of mortality. We aimed to evaluate the burden of co-infections in patients with COVID-19. Methods : We systematically searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, LILACS and CINAHL for eligible studies published from 1 January 2020 to 17 April 2020. We included patients of all ages, in all settings. The main outcome was the proportion of patients with a bacterial, fungal or viral co-infection. . Results : Thirty studies including 3834 patients were included. Overall, 7% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients had a bacterial co-infection (95% CI 3-12%, n=2183, I2=92?2%). A higher proportion of ICU patients had bacterial co-infections than patients in mixed ward/ICU settings (14%, 95% CI 5-26, I2=74?7% versus 4%, 95% CI 1-9, I2= 91?7%). The commonest bacteria were Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. The pooled proportion with a viral co-infection was 3% (95% CI 1-6, n=1014, I2=62?3%), with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and influenza A the commonest. Three studies reported fungal co-infections.

METHODS One hundred patients undergoing LAR-TME with a proximal diverting stoma were analyzed between 2013 and 2016. Postoperative CRP and PCT levels were measured on the 3rd and the 6th postoperative days. RESULTS There were 11 clinical leaks with a negative impact in univariate analysis on AL of male gender, larger and stenotic tumours, intraoperative blood loss > 200 mL, the need for perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative anaemia and an operating time exceeding 180 minutes. On multivariate analysis, only perioperative blood transfusion was an independent AL risk factor. Recorded CRP was higher in AL patients when compared with non-AL cases on both the 3rd postoperative day (152.4 mg/L vs. 93 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (130.5 mg/L vs. 68.2 mg/L; P < 0.0001). The PCT levels also significantly differed between AL and non-AL cases on the 3rd postoperative day (0.5 ng/mL vs. 0.2 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (1.16 ng/mL vs. 0.1 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001). Both CRP and PCT showed high negative predictive values (NPV) for the diagnosis of an AL on both postoperative days. CONCLUSION Following low restorative proctectomy, the high NPV of CRP and PCT measurements for the diagnosis of anastomotic leaks may assist decision-making for early hospital discharge.","output":"Risk factors and inflammatory predictors for Anastomotic Leakage following Total Mesorectal Excision with defunctioning stoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic has shaken the status quo including the way university counseling and assessment centers provide training to graduate students and psychological services to the community.

SEARCH METHODS: Relevant trials were identified by searching literature until 24 April 2021 using the following terms: anakinra, interleukin 1, coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials evaluating the effect of anakinra on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized non-intubated patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies (n = 1,119) were eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. Their bias risk with reference to the assessed parameters was high. In pooled analyses, anakinra reduced the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, OR: 038, 95% confidence interval, CI: 017-085, p= 0.02, I2=67%; 6 studies, n = 587) and mortality risk (OR: 032, 95% CI: 023-045, p< 000001, I2=0%; 9 studies, n = 1,119) compared with standard of care therapy. There were no differences regarding the risk of adverse events, including liver dysfunction (OR: 075, 95% CI: 048-116, p> 005, I2=28%; 5 studies, n = 591) and bacteremia (OR: 107, 95% CI: 042-273, p> 005, I2=71%; 6 studies, n = 727).

Sweden, more than other countries, relied on voluntary measures to fight the pandemic. This provides a particularly interesting context to assess peoples reactions to the threat of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The general aim of this study was to better understand the worried reactions to the virus and the associated lockdown measures. As there have been very few longitudinal studies in this area published to date, development of feelings of worry over time was analyzed over a longer range than in previous research. Affective variables, worry in particular, were included because most of the research in this field has focused on cognitive variables. To employ new methodology, ecological momentary assessment was used for data collection and a multilevel modeling approach was adopted for data analysis. METHODS: Results were based on an unbalanced panel sample of 260 Swedish participants filling in 3226 interview questionnaires by smartphone over a 7-week period in 2020 during the rapid rise of cases in the early phase of the pandemic. Causal factors considered in this study included the perceived severity of an infection, susceptibility of a person to the threat posed by the virus, perceived efficacy of safeguarding measures, and assessment of government action against the spread of COVID-19. The effect of these factors on worries was traced in two analytical steps: the effects at the beginning of the study and the effect on the trend during the study. RESULTS: The level of general worry related to COVID-19 was modest (mean 6.67, SD 2.54 on an 11-point Likert scale); the increase during the study period was small, but the interindividual variation of both the worry level and its increase over time was large. Findings confirmed that the hypothesized causal factors (severity of infection, susceptibility to the threat of the virus, efficacy of safeguarding, and assessment of government preventive action) did indeed affect the level of worry. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed earlier research in a very special case and demonstrated the usefulness of a different study design, which takes a longitudinal perspective, and a new type of data analysis borrowed from multilevel study design.","output":"Using Ecological Momentary Assessment to Study the Development of COVID-19 Worries in Sweden: Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information about factors potentially favoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in rural settings is limited.

In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants over the city of Bengaluru (India) is assessed using Continuous Ambient Air Quality Measurement (CAAQM) data from 10 monitoring stations spread across the city. The data was obtained from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).

The analysis revealed significant reduction in the concentration of ambient air pollutants at both daily and monthly intervals. This can be attributed to the reduction in sources of emission;vehicular traffic, industrial, and other activities. The average reduction in the concentration of NO, NO 2 , NO X, PM 2.5 , and O 3 between 1st March to 12th May 2020 was found to be 63%, 48%, 48%, 18%, and 23% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019.

Research is needed to understand whether clinical guidance designed to improve the experience of parents has been effective. AIMS: To establish parents experiential perspectives of eating disorder care in the UK, compared with guidance published by Beat, a UK eating disorders charity, and Academy for Eating Disorders, the leading international eating disorders professional association. METHOD: A total of six focus groups (one online and five face-to-face) were held throughout the UK. A total of 32 parents attended. All participants were parents of a loved one with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa (mean age 22 years; mean duration of illness 4.4 years). Focus groups were transcribed, and the text was analysed with an inductive approach, to identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified: (a) impact of eating disorder on one's life, (b) current service provisions, (c) navigating the transition process and (d) suggestions for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Current experiences of parents in the UK do not align with the guidelines published by Beat and Academy of Eating Disorders. Parents identified a number of changes that healthcare providers could make, including improved information and support for parents, enhanced training of professionals, consistent care across all UK service providers, policy changes and greater involvement of families in their loved one's care.

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of nonChate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19Crelated hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language.

However, current bladder cancer treatments involve high-dose chemotherapy and high-irradiance PDT which cause debilitating side effects. Moreover, low penetration of light and drugs in target tissues and cumbersome light delivery procedures hinder the clinical utility of PDT and chemotherapy combination for PCI. To circumvent these challenges, a photodynamic-chemotherapy approach is developed comprising tumor-targeting glycosylated nanocarriers, coloaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6) and gemcitabine elaidate (GemE), and a miniaturized implantable wirelessly powered light-emitting diode (LED) as a light source. The device successfully delivers four weekly light doses to the bladder while the nanocarrier promoted the specific accumulation of drugs in tumors. This approach facilitates the combination of low-irradiance PDT (1 mW cm-2 ) and low-dose chemotherapy (1500 lower than clinical dose) which significantly cures and controls orthotopic disease burden (90% treated vs control, 35%) in mice, demonstrating a potential new bladder cancer treatment option.","output":"Wirelessly Activated Nanotherapeutics for In Vivo Programmable Photodynamic-Chemotherapy of Orthotopic Bladder Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has been a seismic event for those of us who provide obesity care for two reasons C it profoundly altered our patients living environment and it fundamentally changed the practice of how we deliver counseling.

Overall, the trend of total consumption (defined daily dose [er 1,000 patient-days) of glycopeptides, including vancomycin and teicoplanin, significantly increased during 2000 to 2003 and remained stable during 2004-2009. Vancomycin consumption significantly increased during 2003 and decreased after 2004. A significant decrease in the resistance rate with time was found for oxacillin- and gentamicin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast, the rates of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterocci increased significantly. A significant correlation was found between the increased use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, -lactam--lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems and the decreased prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast, the increased use of teicoplanin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, -lactam--lactamase inhibitor combinations, and carbapenems was correlated with the increased prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

Pulse oximetry was used for remote monitoring of a subset of patients. Patients required between one and six consecutive telephone assessments, dependent on illness severity, and 23 patients were recalled for in-person assessment. Approximately half of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 required onward referral for respiratory follow-up. This framework reduced unplanned ED reattendances in comparison with a retrospective comparator cohort (4.7% from 22.6%). We reproduced these findings in a validation cohort with a high prevalence of acute COVID-19, managed through the clinic in September-October 2020, where we identified an unplanned ED reattendance rate of 5.2%.

Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important.

Findings In this cross-sectional study of 643 Brazilian municipalities including 18 761 schools, on average, there was no systematic association between school reopening and COVID-19 incidence or mortality in S?o Paulo State up to 12 weeks after reopening, which was also the case for schools in the most vulnerable conditions. Aggregate mobility was already high before the school reopening and did not significantly increase afterwards. Meaning The results of this study suggest that reopening schools under appropriate protocols in low- and middle-income countries during the pandemic is unlikely to be associated with higher aggregate COVID-19 cases or deaths when counterfactual mobility is already high. Importance School closures because of COVID-19 have left 1.6 billion students around the world without in-person classes for a prolonged period. To our knowledge, no study has documented whether reopening schools in low- and middle-income countries during the pandemic was associated with increased aggregate COVID-19 incidence and mortality with appropriate counterfactuals. Objective To test whether reopening schools under appropriate protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased municipal-level COVID-19 cases and deaths in S?o Paulo State, Brazil. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational study of municipalities in S?o Paulo State, Brazil, uses a difference-in-differences analysis to examine the association between municipal decisions to reopen schools during the COVID-19 pandemic and municipal-level COVID-19 case and death rates between October and December 2020. The study compared 129 municipalities that reopened schools in 2020 with 514 that did not and excluded data for 2 municipalities that reopened schools and closed then again. Main Outcomes and Measures New COVID-19 cases and deaths per 10 000 inhabitants up to 12 weeks after school reopenings and municipal-level aggregate mobility for a subset of municipalities. Results There were 8764 schools in the 129 municipalities that reopened schools compared with 9997 in the control group of 514 municipalities that did not reopen schools. The municipalities that reopened schools had a cumulative COVID-19 incidence of 20 cases per 1000 inhabitants and mortality of 0.5 deaths per 1000 inhabitants in September 2020 (the baseline period) compared with an incidence of 18 cases per 1000 inhabitants and mortality of 0.45 deaths per 1000 inhabitants during the baseline period in the comparison group. The findings indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between municipalities that authorized schools to reopen and those that did not for (1) weekly new cases (difference-in-differences, C0.03;95% CI, C0.09 to 0.03) and (2) weekly new deaths (difference-in-differences, C0.003;95% CI, C0.011 to 0.004) before and after October 2020. Reopening schools was not associated with higher disease activity, even in relatively vulnerable municipalities, nor aggregate mobility. Conclusions and Relevance The findings from this study suggest that keeping schools open during the COVID-19 pandemic did not contribute to the aggregate disease activity. This cross-sectional study examines whether reopening schools under appropriate protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased municipal-level COVID-19 cases and deaths in S?o Paulo State, Brazil.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Rates With School Reopening in Brazil During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thirty-day readmissions among elderly Medicare patients are an important hospital quality measure. Although plans for using 30-day readmission measures are under consideration for younger patients, little is known about readmission in younger patients or the relationship between readmissions in younger and elderly patients at the same hospital. METHODS: By using the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we examined readmission patterns in younger patients (18-64 years) using hierarchical models to evaluate associations between hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients and readmission risk in younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. RESULTS: There were 87,818, 98,315, and 103,251 admissions in younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively, with overall 30-day unplanned readmission rates of 8.5%, 21.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Readmission risk in younger patients was significantly associated with hospital 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates for elderly Medicare patients for all 3 conditions. A decrease in an average hospital's 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile was associated with reduction in younger patients' risk of readmission from 8.8% to 8.0% (difference: 0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9) for acute myocardial infarction; 21.8% to 20.0% (difference: 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.2) for heart failure; and 13.9% to 13.1% (difference: 0.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0) for pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Among younger patients, readmission risk was moderately associated with hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare beneficiaries.

During 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by the emergence of lineages with increased fitness. For most of these variants, quantitative information is scarce on epidemiological quantities such as the incubation period and generation time, which are critical for both public health decisions and scientific research. Method. We analyzed a dataset collected during contact tracing activities in the province of Reggio Emilia, Italy, throughout 2021. We determined the distributions of the incubation period using information on negative PCR tests and the date of last exposure from 282 symptomatic cases. We estimated the distributions of the intrinsic generation time (the time between the infection dates of an infector and its secondary cases under a fully susceptible population) using a Bayesian inference approach applied to 4,435 SARS-CoV-2 cases clustered in 1,430 households where at least one secondary case was recorded. Results. We estimated a mean incubation period of 4.9 days (95% credible intervals, CrI, 4.4-5.4; 95 percentile of the mean distribution: 1-12) for Alpha and 4.5 days (95%CrI 4.0-5.0; 95 percentile: 1-10) for Delta.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of CAP patients from January to March 2020, in our university hospital in China. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of emergent viruses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten pediatric and five adult patients with cervical and/or facial abscess treated with this drainage method were retrospectively reviewed. Using an indwelling needle cannula (18-14 G Surflow?, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), abscesses were penetrated under ultrasonic examination. Once purulent retention was identified, the inner metal needle was removed and the outer elastic needle was left and fixed. The outer needle was connected to the tube for continuous suction drainage for large abscess. RESULTS: The primary diseases of these abscesses were cervical abscess of dental origin (5), purulent lymphadenitis (3), pyriform sinus fistula (2) and subperiosteal abscess due to mastoiditis (2), circumorbital cellulitis (1), infection of Warthin's tumor (1), and unknown origin (1). The median (range) duration of drainage was 4 days (3-9 days). Abscesses were successfully treated, and no patients required additional incision for abscess drainage. No apparent scars after drainage were observed. CONCLUSION: This technique resembles the usual venous placement of an indwelling needle cannula and is thought to be familiar to physicians.

This review summarizes the progress in neutralizing antibodies development and the germline enrichment of effective antibodies, which will shed light on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design.","output":"Neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin and Oritavancin are semisynthetic lipoglycopeptides (LGP) that are FDA-approved for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, but emerging data supports LGP use for other serious gram positive (GP) infections. We describe our experience with LGP during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We initiated a quality improvement project to assess the use of LGP for label and off-label indications at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Health Care System. We define serious GP infections as infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, joint infections, or bacteremia. Patients with serious GP infections that receivedLGP were selected at the treating physician's discretion. We reviewed medical records of all patients receiving at least one dose of long-acting LGP from March 1, 2020 - May 31, 2021. We described patient demographics, clinical information,and outcomes (90-day readmission). RESULTS: Nineteen patients with GP infections received LGP (table). Overall, the most common infection was cellulitis 7 (35%); 14 patients received LGPs for serious GP infections. All patients received at least one other non-LGP antibiotic for at least 2 days, majority vancomycin (60%) and cefazolin (30%). Overall, the median hospital stay among patients who received LGP was 8.5 days (range: 2-45 days), for those with serious GP infections the median hospital stay was 15 days (range: 4-45). 90% of patientswho received LGP were discharged home. Number of LGP doses ranged from 1 to 6 doses total, based on type of infection. Sixteen veterans (80%) followed up in outpatient clinicfollowing discharge within 2 weeks, two patients were discharged to home hospice due to complications of underlying malignancies and two patients were lost to follow up. Noadverse drug events were reported, and none with serious GP infections required rehospitalization at 90 days. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that long-acting LGP may be valuable tools to treat serious gram-positive infections by optimizing theduration of hospitalization and preventing unnecessary admissions to acute care and nursing facilities for daily antibiotic infusions. These aspects of LGP use are especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic where nosocomial transmission has been documented. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"617.

COVID-19 became a pandemic 71 days later. AIM: To report the clinical and epidemiological features, laboratory data and outcomes of the first group of 11 returned travellers with COVID-19 in Australia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multi-centre case series. All patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted to tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. RESULTS: The median age of our patient cohort was 42 years (IQR, 24-53 years) with six men and five women. Eight patients (72.7%) had returned from Wuhan, one from Shenzhen, one from Japan, and one from Europe. Possible human-to-human transmission from close family contacts in gatherings overseas occurred in two cases. Symptoms on admission were fever, cough and sore throat (n = 9, 81.8%). Co-morbidities included hypertension (n = 3, 27.3%) and hypercholesterolaemia (n = 2, 18.2%). No patients developed severe acute respiratory distress nor required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. After a median hospital stay of 14.5 days (IQR, 6.75-21), all patients were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: This is a historical record of the first COVID-19 cases in Australia during the early biocontainment phase of the national response. These findings were invaluable for establishing early inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 models of care and informing the management of COVID-19 overtime as the outbreak evolved.

Studies have shown opportunistic infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis, candida and pneumocystis pneumonia in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However data on incidence of PC in this subset of patients is sparse(2). We discuss a patient with post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis(PF) who developed PC. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old lifelong non-smoker male presented with worsening dyspnea and cough. One month prior to this, he was treated for new hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia and pulmonary embolism and was on baseline oxygen therapy 4L/min since. On presentation, he was noted to be afebrile, tachycardic HR of 114/min, tachypneic with RR 24/min, and saturating 93% on 6L O2. He had bilateral crackles on chest auscultation. Initial labs were unremarkable except ABG showing normal pH of 7.38, with hypoxia pO2 58 and hypercarbia pCo2 65. COVID-19 PCR remained positive. Chest X-ray was suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. Chest CT revealed severe multifocal pneumonia with interval development of bronchiectasis. Patient was initiated on IV linezolid, meropenem, remdesivir and dexamethasone;he required BiPAP support due to respiratory failure. Worsening respiratory failure despite completion of antibiotic course, prompted initiation of ceftazidime. He was also started on trial of IV methylprednisolone 125mg every six hourly in view of suspected post-COVID-19 PF, administered for two weeks. Patient's hospitalization was further complicated by critical illness myopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter. Subsequently fungal serology returned positive for cryptococcal antigen and fluconazole therapy was initiated. He had no history of immunocompromise such as HIV, Diabetes, ESRF etc. CSF analysis was deferred since he had no CNS manifestations. Patient showed clinical improvement into second week of hospitalization and repeat CT scan done 18 days after starting fluconazole showed interval improvement of multifocal infiltrate. DISCUSSION: Post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is increasingly identified with evolving clinical data. Dysregulated release of matrix metalloproteinases, epithelial injury, and fibroproliferation are all implicated in the pathogenesis of post infective PF(3). CONCLUSIONS: High dose steroids used in the management of PF pose serious risk of complications related to immunosuppression and subsequent opportunistic infections such as pulmonary cryptococcosis and pneumocystis pneumonia. As the pandemic is still evolving, it will be interesting to see if PF and opportunistic infections become an established post-COVID-19 sequela.

In this review, we focus on the major advantages and latest evolutions of CMR in diagnosis and prognostication of TTS and discuss future perspectives and needs in the field of research and cardiovascular imaging in TTS. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific CMR criteria for TTS diagnosis at the time of acute presentation are established. In addition to identifying the typical regional wall motion abnormalities, CMR allows for precise quantification of right ventricular and left ventricular (LV) function, the assessment of additional abnormalities/complications (e.g. pericardial and/or pleural effusion, LV thrombi), and most importantly myocardial tissue characterization (myocardial oedema, inflammation, necrosis/fibrosis). SUMMARY: CMR enables a comprehensive assessment of the entire spectrum of functional and structural changes that occur in patients with TTS and may have also a prognostic impact.

We conducted a scoping review to identify what is known about the debt burden on those who have been incarcerated and their families and how this impacts their lives. We searched 14 data bases from 1990 to 2019 for all original research addressing financial debt held by those incarcerated in the United States, and screened articles for relevance and extracted data from pertinent studies. These 31 studies selected for inclusion showed that this population is heavily burdened by debt that was accumulated in three general categories: debt directly from criminal justice involvement such as LFOs, preexisting debt that compounded during incarceration, and debts accrued during reentry for everyday survival. Debt was generally shown to have a negative effect on financial well-being, reentry, family structure, and mental health. Debts from LFOs and child support is very common among the justice-involved population and are largely unpayable. Other forms of debt likely to burden this population remain largely understudied.

To supplement the traditional text descriptions, figures, and lecture material we had students play the role of glomerular filtrate, gaining and losing osmolarity while moving through a simulated Loop of Henle. Students were given three poker chips, each representing an osmotic pressure of 100 milliosmolar (mOsm). Each student took a position at one of six steps on each side of a table. For each round, 1) students on the ?ascending? side conducted ?active transport? to produce a maximum gradient of 200 mOsm between the lumen of the ascending loop and the interstitial space (difference of 2 chips);2) after students ?pumped? their ions, students on the ?descending? side ?equilibrated? with the interstitial space by collecting chips from a cup until they had the same quantity as in the interstitial space;3) students then physically ?flowed? through the loop. This learning tool, which was highly effective in a face-to-face classroom, did not translate well to a remote environment. Despite spending an entire online class explaining the activity, students remained confused. Unlike in the classroom where everyone participates simultaneously and sees the process ?in real-time,? only one person could participate at any given time virtually, making it hard to visualize flow. To address this shortcoming we collaborated with two undergraduate students to develop a ?flipped? version of the CCM activity. In the online version the player 1) actively participates in CCM in ?freeplay? mode or 2) watches the process in ?simulation? mode. During freeplay, the player drags and drops icons representing solutes or water from the loop of Henle into the interstitial fluid to build the osmotic gradient;a color gradient associated with solute concentrations highlights how the gradient forms. Modeled after the in-person activity, the loop of Henle is divided into boxes, six on the ascending limb and six on the descending limb, where each box represents the positions of students in the original activity. To maximize engagement by minimizing repetitive dragging and dropping, the player is confined to one box at a time and is only responsible for adjusting the concentration of this ?home? box. If the player adjusts the concentration correctly, the player's home box moves one unit over to the adjacent box and thus ?flows? through the loop. Along the way, concentration shifts within other boxes are automated by the game engine. The freeplay game ends when the player's home box reaches the top of the ascending limb and exits the loop. In the simulation mode, the icons of solute and water move by themselves, and the osmotic gradient is created automatically. The player can watch the CCM process unimpeded and may pause or speed up the process as desired. We will pilot this interactive, online game in our Spring 2021 course and assess student learning with reflections, homework problems, and exam questions. We predict implementation of this game will enhance student understanding of the CCM mechanism in the mammalian kidney.

Two epitopes specific to DTx and recognized by antibodies generated post-vaccination were selected to create a bi-epitope peptide, biEP, by synthesizing the epitopes in tandem.

In addition to the direct impact of the virus on patient morbidity and mortality, the effect of lockdown strategies on health and healthcare utilization have become apparent. The effect of the pandemic on children on home mechanical ventilation is unknown. We examined the impact of the pandemic on pediatric healthcare utilization in children on home mechanical ventilation. Methods: Between March 11 and December 1, 2020, we conducted a single center, retrospective analysis of 81 children, younger than 18 years old, on home mechanical ventilation who are followed at the UT Physicians High Risk Children's Clinic. Using the same cohort of patients, we compared healthcare utilization during the pandemic in 2020 to the same period in 2019. Results: We observed a massive decline in pediatric healthcare utilization during the pandemic year compared with the previous year. Emergency department total visits decreased by 70% (33 vs 10) (p&lt;0.01). Total number of hospital admissions declined by 38% (52 vs 32) (p=0.03). The mean length of stay (LOS) in hospital admission was 6.7 days in 2019 and 5.3 days in 2020 (p=0.3).

Conclusions: Our data illustrate a significant improvement in pediatric hospital utilization and outcomes for children on home mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We speculate that fewer medical office visits, increase in telehealth follow ups, school closures, social distancing, massive mask utilization, and increased hand washing during the pandemic year were protective factors that contributed to a lower hospitalization rate.

Many viruses enter the host cell through an endocytic pathway and hijack endosomes for their journey towards sites of replication. For delivery of their genome to the host cell cytoplasm and to avoid degradation, viruses have to escape this endosomal compartment without host detection. Viruses have developed complex mechanisms to penetrate the endosomal membrane and have evolved to co-opt several host factors to facilitate endosomal escape. Conversely, there is an extensive variety of cellular mechanisms to counteract or impede viral replication. At the level of cell entry, there are cellular defense mechanisms that recognize endosomal membrane damage caused by virus-induced membrane fusion and pore formation, as well as restriction factors that block these processes. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster, we describe the different mechanisms that viruses have evolved to escape the endosomal compartment, as well as the counteracting cellular protection mechanisms.

We analyze management strategies of the epidemic course (as they were implemented through lockdown and reopening procedures in many of the US states and countries worldwide); however, to more clearly illustrate ideas, we focus on the example of a small scale college town community, with the timeline of control measures introduced in the state of New York. We generate predictions, and assess the efficiency of these control measures (closures, mobility restrictions, social distancing), in a sustainability context.","output":"Management strategies in a SEIR-type model of COVID 19 community spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The effects of the spread of COVID-19 across the world are devastating, both from a health and an economic perspective. However, we also see encouraging examples of collaborative and innovative initiatives, in society and in organizations. The purpose of this paper is to focus on initiatives related to digital business model innovation. The authors explore how organizational characteristics provide a variety of opportunities for digital responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss the potential consequences for the speed of digital transformation in organizations and society. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors analyze how organizations attempt to mitigate the negative effects of fighting COVID-19 using digital business model responses. The authors draw on a qualitative study where they have collected data from the retail and service industries. They have analyzed the data in relation to theory to better understand this ongoing phenomenon. Findings The authors have identified four categories of organizations (crisispreneurs, accelerators, endurers and thrivers). Each category faces different challenges and shows a different intensity in their digital transformation. The authors propose that the rapid turn toward digital business models will have enduring effects, as organizations have gained transformational capabilities that will remain, and that the digital trajectory has, as a result, changed forever. Originality/value The findings in this paper point toward new challenges for leaders and policymakers in terms of how to support initiatives and meet the needs of different categories of organizations while simultaneously being conscious of the potential societal effects of this rapid digital shift. The authors hope that this paper can be of value for managing this shock and learning how to adapt for the future taking certain aspects of current business models as the departure point.","output":"Responding to the COVID-19 crisis: the rapid turn toward digital business models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculous meningitis is commonly associated with a poor outcome. Simple bedside prognostic scores can help immensely in predicting the outcome. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A total of 721 patients, from 5 of our previous studies, were included. With primary outcome measure as death, a prognostic model was derived using binary logistic regression. The model was assessed using discrimination and calibration, and internally validated using the bootstrap method. A bedside prognostic score was derived by rounding of the regression coefficients to the nearest integers. RESULTS: A total of 126 (17.48%) patients died. The final model found that higher age, stage III disease, baseline MBI &#8804; 12, papilledema and hydrocephalus were significant predictors of death. The final model showed good discrimination as evident by an AUC = 83.1% (95% confidence interval 79.5%-86.7%, P < .001) and good calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow test P = .579). The model remained valid after internal validation by boot strapping. A simple bedside score with the acronym MASH-P to denote variables baseline MBI (M), age (A), stage (S), hydrocephalus (H) and papilledema (P), was thus derived. The score can range from 0 to 10. Higher the score, higher is the probability of death; a score of 0 carries a predicted probability of just 1.7% while a score of 10 corresponds to a predicted probability of 65%. An electronic ready reckoner has also been developed to aid prognostication on the go. CONCLUSION: MASH-P is a simple prognostic scoring model that can be used at bedside and aid in decision making as well as counselling.","output":"Derivation of a bedside score (MASH-P) to predict 6-month mortality in tuberculous meningitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Low energy availability results in physiological adaptations which contribute to unfavourable health outcomes. Little information exists on perceptions of nutritional advice to eat more food to maintain health and enhance performance. The aim of this study was to explore athletes and coaches perceptions towards advice to athletes to eat larger than their current quantities of food and to explore how nutritionists could deliver this advice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (~20 min in length) were conducted using online communication technology, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The interview explored perceptions of the nutritional advice provided, its role in health and performance, and the challenges to eating larger amounts of food. Data were analysed using NVIVO 1.2 using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Nine elite athletes (female = 6; males = 3) and nine high-performance coaches (female = 3; male = 6) completed the semi-structured interviews. Athletes reported improved training consistency, fewer injuries and illnesses, and improved resilience when consuming adequate energy and nutrients to meet their needs. Lack of time and meal preparation difficulties were the main challenges faced to fuelling. Conclusions: Although education about under-fuelling is important, motivating, enabling, and supporting athletes to change behaviour is pivotal to increasing athlete self-awareness and to make long-term nutritional changes.","output":"Athletes and Coaches Perceptions of Nutritional Advice: Eating More Food for Health and Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nearly 30% of health workers with COVID-19 didn't know they had it.","output":"The Importance of PPE and Regular Testing in Health Care Facilities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has presented unique and unprecedented struggles for all people, yet they tend to be magnified among marginalized communities. Indeed, in the United States, transgender (trans) people experience oppression in many facets of their lives, which places them at an increased risk for both COVID-19 exposure and complications. This oppression can be broadly categorized into two distinct, yet interrelated categories: health disparities (e.g., decreased immune health) and structural barriers (e.g., employment discrimination, policing). Recent scholarship has examined trans peoples risk for COVID-19 exposure and mortality, however few articles examine intersectional identities, and, to our knowledge, none have interrogated oppressive power structures (e.g., the prison industrial complex). We aim to fill these critical gaps and argue that it is imperative for cisgender people to partner with trans communities to dismantle these harmful systems, positively impacting the lives of trans individuals during the pandemic and beyond.

Second, infectious diseases have a negative and significant influence on the trade openness, but more intensively in developed countries than in developing countries. Finally, using the VEC model, our results demonstrate that the short run causality between diseases, economic growth, and trade openness is unidirectional running from infectious diseases to trade and economic growth. However, in the long run, there is bidirectional Granger causality among the running variables.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the benefit and risk of thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily extended for 25 to 45 days after hospitalization for preventing major thromboembolism in medically ill patients using the pooled data in 16 496 patients from 2 randomized trials, MARINER (Medically Ill Patient Assessment of Rivaroxaban Versus Placebo in Reducing Post\\\\Discharge Venous Thrombo\\\\Embolism Risk) and MAGELLAN (Multicenter, randomized, parallel\\\\group efficacy and safety study for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medically ill patients comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin). The data from the MARINER trial were pooled with the data from the MAGELLAN trial in patients who were free of thrombotic or bleeding events up to the last dose of enoxaparin/placebo and who continued in the outpatient phase of thromboprophylaxis. The composite outcome of major thromboembolic events (symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and nonhemorrhagic stroke) and all\\\\cause mortality was used to assess benefit and was compared with the risk of the composite of fatal and critical site bleeding. The incidence of the composite efficacy outcome was 1.80% (148 of 8222 patients) in the rivaroxaban group, compared with 2.31% (191 of 8274 patients in the placebo group) (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63C0.97], P=0.024).

METHODS: A cohort of youth ages 15C24 in Nairobi, Kenya was surveyed at three time points over an 18-month period prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic: JuneCAugust 2019 (prepandemic), AugustCOctober 2020 (12-month follow-up) and May 2021 (18-month follow-up). We characterise (1) prevalence, relative timing and help-seeking for leading forms of GBV, (2) GBV trajectories over 18 months and (3) associations of individual, dyad and COVID-related factors on GBV trajectories among AGYW (n=612) in Nairobi, Kenya. Virtual focus group discussions (n=12) and interviews (n=40) contextualise quantitative results. RESULTS: Intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence hovered at 17% across time points (ever at pre-pandemic; past 12 months at 12-month follow-up (2020); past 6 months at 18-month follow-up (2021)); non-partner sexual violence (SV) was 3% at 12-month and 18-month follow-up. Overall, 27.6% of AGYW experienced IPV during the pandemic. IPV during the pandemic was associated with work as the primary pre-COVID activity, low social support and partner age difference >4 years. Among AGYW partnered at all three time points, 66.2% stayed IPV-free (no IPV), 9.2% saw IPV resolve by 18-month follow-up, while 11.1% had IPV start and 13.6% experienced intermittent IPV. Help-seeking for IPV and SV in 2020 (11.1% and 4.6%, respectively) increased to 21.7% and 15.1%, respectively, by 2021. Qualitative results speak to impacts of curfews, and pandemic-related financial stress in prompting conflict and threatening traditional gender roles, and underlying conditions that enable IPV. CONCLUSION: The persistence of IPV against AGYW in Nairobi prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects endemic conditions and pandemic-specific stressors. Youth, including unmarried youth, remain a priority population for GBV prevention and survivor-centred response.","output":"Gender-based violence during COVID-19 among adolescent girls and young women in Nairobi, Kenya: a mixed-methods prospective study over 18 months"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the United States. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 3.2% (R(0) = 4) to 7.2% (R(0) = 2) reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, ranging from 1.9% to 18.3% of healthcare worker households and 5.7% to 8.8% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand (R(0) = 2). We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p < 0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 71.1% to 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU bed demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible tradeoff between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","output":"Projected geographic disparities in healthcare worker absenteeism from COVID-19 school closures and the economic feasibility of child care subsidies: a simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EMERgENCY MEdICINE RESIdENCY CPC From the Case Records of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University Residency in Emergency Medicine A 2-Year-Old girl with multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (mIS-C) ReBecca LeVin, MD;eLizaBetH S JacoBS, MD dR REbECCA lEVIN: A 2-year-old otherwise healthy female presented to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with fever, fussiness and worsening rash DR lEVIN: The definition of MIS-C is vague, and many febrile pediatric patients (especially early in their illness presentation) have not yet developed secondary symptoms of a viral illness (such as cough, rhinorrhea, or GI symptoms) Like many MIS-C patients, our patient appropriately received empiric antibiotic coverage with ceftriaxone before a multidisciplinary team determined the patient's ultimate diagnosis DR ElIzAbETh JACObS: One must certainly entertain the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in this patient [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Rhode Island Medical Journal is the property of Rhode Island Medical Society and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A 2-Year-Old Girl with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim at harnessing economic complexity for sustainable and inclusive economic growth by calling for a decade of joint action.

We illustrate this by means of two small case studies in Switzerland, a country with a federal system that enables decentralized economic development. The first case study investigates the economic ecosystem of the small town Monthey to show how productive migrants and embedded multinational companies increase the knowledge and know-how of local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The successful collaboration of insiders and outsiders accounts for the internal economic complexity that makes the region innovative and competitive. The second case study highlights the importance of the federalist system by showing how the canton of Solothurn succeeded in nurturing globally competitive export-oriented SMEs. We conclude that the success of these inclusive economic ecosystems in unexpected places may only be understood in the specific geographical, historical and political context, as well as the general openness of these regions toward entrepreneurial migrants and global business. The importance of local social capital makes it hard to replicate such success stories.

We set out to determine the prevalence of wearing masks to prevent COVID-19 and compliance with appropriate measures for the correct use of face masks among the general public in Japan where wearing medical masks is a cultural normality. This cross-sectional study was based on an internet-based survey completed by 2141 people (50.8% men, aged 20C79 years) who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company between 1 April and 6 April 2020. Participants were asked to indicate how often they wore masks for prevention and to what extent they practiced appropriate measures suggested by the World Health Organization. The prevalence of wearing masks was 80.9% and compliance rates with appropriate measures ranged from 38.3% to 83.5%. Only 23.1% complied with all recommendations. Compliance rates were overall low in men and persons with low household incomes. Our results, hence show that many citizens implement inaccurate measures when using face masks.

However, clinical development of immune-oncology (IO) agents presents both opportunities and challenges, and not all patients benefit to the same extent. Many factors influence trial designs and could potentially threaten the success of promising IO drugs: 1. Most IO trials still rely on response evaluation criteria based on image assessment only, while new approaches including biomarkers tracking response should be incorporated. 2. Surrogate endpoints for efficacy are still inferred from classical anticancer drugs that have not been specifically validated for IO trials. 3. There is a need for biomarker-driven clinical studies in order to select appropriated patients. 4. Long-term toxicity monitoring is needed, and dosage calculation should not rely on dose-dependent toxicities. 5. Optimizing the design of new IO agents with collaborative approaches assessing multiple drugs on a biomarker-based basis is needed. ABSTRACT: The rapidly evolving landscape of immuno-oncology (IO) is redefining the treatment of a number of cancer types. IO treatments are becoming increasingly complex, with different types of drugs emerging beyond checkpoint inhibitors. However, many of the new drugs either do not progress from phase I-II clinical trials or even fail in late-phase trials. We have identified at least five areas in the development of promising IO treatments that should be redefined for more efficient designs and accelerated approvals. Here we review those critical aspects of IO drug development that could be optimized for more successful outcome rates in all cancer types. It is important to focus our efforts on the mechanisms of action, types of response and adverse events of these novel agents. The use of appropriate clinical trial designs with robust biomarkers of response and surrogate endpoints will undoubtedly facilitate the development and subsequent approval of these drugs. Further research is also needed to establish biomarker-driven strategies to select which patients may benefit from immunotherapy and identify potential mechanisms of resistance.","output":"Lights and Shadows in Immuno-Oncology Drug Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The triaging of COVID 19 patients is of paramount importance to plan further management. There are several clinical and laboratory parameters that help in categorizing the disease severity, triaging, and prognostication. Little is known about the prognostic significance of eosinopenia in predicting the severity of COVID 19 from large hospital data especially from low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of eosinopenia as an early prognostic marker for assessing the outcomes in COVID 19 patients and to assess the superiority of eosinopenia as a prognostic marker for assessing the outcomes in COVID 19 patients compared to lymphopenia and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR). MATERIAL: The study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital. A retrospective longitudinal approach was adopted wherein the hospital records of COVID 19 patients were analysed. Two separate groups of patients were included for analysis to describe the association between initial eosinophil counts of the patients and the clinical outcomes. In the first group, the disease severity in terms of clinical and radiological parameters was compared in patients of COVID 19 presenting with and without the presence of initial eosinopenia. Commonly used markers for triage namely lymphopenia and NLR were compared with the presence of initial eosinopenia among the patients who progressed to moderate and severe disease. In the second group, an analysis of eosinopenia was made among the patients who succumbed to the illness. OBSERVATION: It was seen that 29.6% of patients with eosinopenia had moderate and severe disease compared to those without eosinopenia where only 10.8 % had moderate disease, none had severe disease. It was seen that 19.7% of patients with eosinopenia but no lymphopenia had more severe disease compared to patients with lymphopenia but no eosinopenia where 10.8% of the patients had moderate disease, none had severe disease. In patients younger than 60 years who died of COVID 19, it was found that initial eosinopenia was found in 86 % whereas a high neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio >17 was seen in only 25.6% of patients who died. Thus, implying that is eosinopenia is an important marker of disease severity in COVID 19. CONCLUSION: Eosinopenia is an important parameter in the evaluation of COVID 19 and the presence of it should alert the clinicians regarding the further progression of the disease. It is not only an important marker but also an early marker for severe disease.","output":"A study to evaluate the role of eosinophil count as a prognostic marker for assessing the outcome in patients with COVID 19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Em 2020, o mundo foi atingido pela pandemia de SARS-CoV-2.

This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the comparative efficacy, safety, and acceptability of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) commonly used off label to treat DRP. METHODS: We included 22 eligible studies from a systematic literature review of AAPs (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole) used off label to treat DRP. Study outcomes were: (1) efficacy-neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home (NPI-NH psychosis subscale), (2) safety-mortality, cerebrovascular events (CVAEs), and others (somnolence, falls, fractures, injuries, etc.), and (3) acceptability-discontinuations due to all causes, lack of efficacy, and adverse events (AEs). We used random-effects modeling to estimate pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) for NPI-NH psychosis subscale scores and odds ratios (OR) for other dichotomous outcomes, with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, aripiprazole (SMD - 0.12; 95% CI - 0.31, 0.06), and olanzapine (SMD - 0.17; 95% CI - 0.04; 0.02) demonstrated small, non-significant numerical improvements in NPI-NH psychosis scores (5 studies; n = 1891), while quetiapine (SMD 0.04; 95% CI - 0.23, 0.32) did not improve symptoms. The odds of mortality (15 studies, n = 4989) were higher for aripiprazole (OR 1.58; 95% CI 0.62, 4.04), brexpiprazole (OR 2.22; 95% CI 0.30, 16.56), olanzapine (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.84, 5.85), quetiapine (OR 1.68; 95% CI 0.70, 4.03), and risperidone (OR 1.63; 95% CI 0.93, 2.85) than for placebo. Risperidone (OR 3.68; 95% CI 1.68, 8.95) and olanzapine (OR 4.47; 95% CI 1.36, 14.69) demonstrated significantly greater odds of CVAEs compared to placebo. Compared with placebo, odds of all-cause discontinuation were significantly lower for aripiprazole (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.51, 0.98; 20 studies; 5744 patients) and higher for other AAPs. Aripiprazole (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.31, 0.82) and olanzapine (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.31, 0.74) had significantly lower odds of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (OR 12 studies; n = 4382) compared to placebo, while results for quetiapine and risperidone were not significant. Compared with placebo, the odds of discontinuation due to AEs (19 studies, n = 5445) were higher for olanzapine (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.75, 3.92), brexpiprazole (OR 1.80; 95% CI 0.80, 4.07), quetiapine (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.82, 1.91), aripiprazole (OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.90, 2.13), and risperidone (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.02, 1.94). CONCLUSIONS: Overall results demonstrate that, compared with placebo, quetiapine is not associated with improvement in psychosis in patients with dementia, while olanzapine and aripiprazole have non-significant small numerical improvements. These off-label AAPs (quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole) are associated with greater odds of mortality, CVAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs than placebo.

METHODS The weights of 38% SDF (Saforide) and 5% NaF (Duraphat) applied to the occlusal surface of an extracted human upper first premolar with a regular-size (2.50-mm tip diameter) micro-applicator were measured using an electronic-analytical balance. Afterwards, the weight of 38% SDF applied to a premolar using the micro-applicators of 5 common brands (Premium Plus, 3M, Dentsply, Elevate Oral Care, and SDI) were studied. The tip diameter of each micro-applicator was measured under a microscope. The weights of the delivered fluoride and silver were also calculated. RESULTS The mean weights of the fluoride delivered via the SDF solution and NaF varnish were 0.25  0.07 mg and 0.49  0.08 mg, respectively (P < .001). In addition, the tip diameters of the micro-applicators ranged from 1.89  0.03 mm to 2.76  0.02 mm. The mean weights of the fluoride delivered per application of 38% SDF using different applicators ranged from 0.13  0.06 mg to 0.30  0.09 mg, whereas the mean weights of the silver ranged from 0.76  0.32 mg to 1.68  0.50 mg. The weights of the delivered 38% SDF solution varied with the brand and with the tip diameters of the dental micro-applicators (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS The fluoride of the 38% SDF solution delivered topically was significantly less than that of 5% NaF varnish.

However, published evidence of cardiac evaluation by imaging techniques including echocardiography is rare. We aimed to evaluate myocardial involvement by echocardiography in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We studied 64 patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) in Khorshid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, from February 20, 2020 until May 20, 2020. Demographic characteristics, laboratory tests, and electrocardiography (ECG) data were collected and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) using a focused time-efficient echocardiography protocol was performed. RESULTS: Mean age of the participating patients was 66.40 +/- 14.14 years (range: 34.0-92.0 years), and 35 patients (54.7%) were men. Reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function was seen in 20 (32%) patients. Only 4 patients had LV ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%. Cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) was elevated (over 15 pg/ml) in 39 (60.9%) patients and was significantly associated with higher mortality in these patients (P = 0.05). In addition, dynamic ST and T wave changes and new bundle branch blocks had a significant association with adverse clinical outcome (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: New LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in patients with severe COVID-19 was mild to moderate and not uncommon and had no significant adverse effect on the prognosis of these patients, although elevation of cardiac biomarkers could predict mortality and had an adverse effect on clinical outcome.","output":"Cardiac involvement according to echocardiographic findings in severe coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular and other circulatory system diseases have been implicated in the severity of COVID-19 in adults.

It affects the kidney in virtually all patients with classical and some late onset variants. Podocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, tubular and mesangial cells are involved in different ways. Proteinuria and chronic kidney disease are the result of the progressive accumulation of the enzyme substrates globotriaosylceramide (GB3) and lyso-GB3 in the cytoplasm of these cells (mainly in lysosomes), which leads to cellular and organ dysfunction and eventually renal failure and end-stage kidney disease. Specific enzyme replacement therapy and pharmacological chaperone are at present the main therapeutic approach. After enzyme infusion, the delivered enzyme is differentially uptaken by kidney cells in three different ways: By Mannose-6-phosphate receptor, megalin and sortilin. The delivered enzyme gradually clears cells from the accumulation of the glycosphingolipids and contributes to a cellular healthier status. The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to the collapse of health systems around the world and to thousands of deaths.

These advances in telemedicine range from individual to population levels, allowing the exchange of patient information for diagnosis and management of health problems, primary care prevention, and education of physicians via distance learning. OBJECTIVE: This scientometric investigation aims to examine collaborative research networks, dominant research themes and disciplines, and seminal research studies that have contributed most to the field of telemedicine. This information is vital for scientists, institutions, and policy stakeholders to evaluate research areas where more infrastructural or scholarly contributions are required. METHODS: For analyses, we used CiteSpace (version 4.0 R5; Drexel University), which is a Java-based software that allows scientometric analysis, especially visualization of collaborative networks and research themes in a specific field. RESULTS: We found that scholarly activity has experienced a significant increase in the last decade. Most important works were conducted by institutions located in high-income countries. A discipline-specific shift from radiology to telestroke, teledermatology, telepsychiatry, and primary care was observed. The most important innovations that yielded a collaborative influence were reported in the following medical disciplines, in descending order: public environmental and occupational health, psychiatry, pediatrics, health policy and services, nursing, rehabilitation, radiology, pharmacology, surgery, respiratory medicine, neurosciences, obstetrics, and geriatrics. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a continuous rise in scholarly activity in telemedicine, we noticed several gaps in the literature. For instance, all the primary and secondary research central to telemedicine was conducted in the context of high-income countries, including the evidence synthesis approaches that pertained to implementation aspects of telemedicine. Furthermore, the research landscape and implementation of telemedicine infrastructure are expected to see exponential progress during and after the COVID-19 era.","output":"Harnessing Telemedicine for the Provision of Health Care: Bibliometric and Scientometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol and drug misuse continue to result in negative outcomes in the United States.

This study evaluated the clinical features, surgical and antibiotics treatment strategies, and treatment outcomes in patients with endophthalmitis caused by liver abscess. METHODS: Between April 2014 and April 2019, the clinical data of 16 patients (19 eyes) with endophthalmitis associated with liver abscess who underwent surgery at Shengjing Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, we evaluated the final visual outcomes in the patients to determine the efficacy of surgery. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (18 eyes) underwent intravitreal injection followed by vitrectomy after admission. One patient (1 eye) only underwent intravitreal injection. Of the 16 patients, 3 patients (3 eyes) had recurrent intraocular inflammation and eventually underwent evisceration. Systemic antibiotics were administered for all patients based on the results of vitreous humor culture, blood culture, and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Outpatient follow-ups were performed until the patients were stable (6 months). Of the 19 eyes, 1 eye (5%) had visual acuity restored to 20/200, 6 eyes (31%) had visual acuity restored to counting fingers (CF), 2 eyes (11%) had visual acuity restored to hand motion (HM), 4 eyes (22%) showed only light perception (LP), and the remaining 6 eyes (31%) showed no light perception (NLP).

Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our observational cross-sectional study employed a voluntary and anonymous survey aimed at Spanish medical internists and distributed through an ad hoc platform of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine. RESULTS: The most common and relevant ethical issues for Spanish internists are related to patients' end of life (decisions limiting therapeutic effort, use of palliative treatments, the establishment of do-not-resuscitate orders), the conflicts arising within the doctor-patient/family relationship, and making decisions with noncompetent patients. These results are similar to those of other English and European series. The ethical problems further complicate the healthcare activity of clinicians who more often notice these problems (50.3%) than those who do not notice them (16%).

Results: Of the 2681 participants, 1933 completed the questionnaire (response rate = 72%;55% female;meanage = 41, SD = 24, rangeage = 5C91). Overall, 68% reported an intention to get vaccinated. Vaccination intention was higher in social/healthcare workers, and increased with age, trust in public health institutions, and confidence in the vaccine efficacy. Prior infection of a family member, predilection for waiting for more evidence on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, and for alternative protective means were negatively associated with intention. Conclusion: In view of needs of COVID-19 vaccine boosters and of suboptimal vaccination coverage, our results have relevant public health implications and suggest that communication about vaccine safety and efficacy, and aims of vaccination programs, should be bi-directional, proportionate, and tailored to the concerns, expectations, and beliefs of different population subgroups.","output":"Why Vaccinate Against COVID-19?

The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has hastened the need to face up to this challenge and has furthered the need to approach the issue from the perspective of digitalisation. To achieve this, it is necessary to design training programmes geared towards teaching staff and which address both the use of technology and instructional design aimed at promoting the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) and automatic feedback systems. In this study, work was carried out with 23 teachers (8 inexperienced and 15 experienced teachers) in a training programme conducted through Moodle. The aims were: (1) to test whether there were any significant differences between the behaviour patterns of new teachers compared to experienced teachers, (2) to determine whether clusters of behaviour patterns corresponded to the type of teacher and (3) to ascertain whether the level of teacher satisfaction with the training activity in digital teaching will depend on the type of teacher. A quantitative as well as a qualitative design was applied. Differences were found in the behaviour patterns in the training activities for the development of rubrics and use of learning analytics systems in virtual learning environments. It was also found that the type of teacher did not correspond exactly to the behaviour cluster in the learning platform. In addition, no significant differences were found in the level of satisfaction between the two kinds of teacher.

RESULTS A favorable SI-ASPECTS (8-10) was present in 501 patients, 132 patients had a moderately favorable SI-ASPECTS (6-7) and 101 patients had an unfavorable SI-ASPECTS (0-5). Irrespective of the treatment modality, no patient with an unfavorable SI-ASPECTS had a good outcome and 38% died during hospital stay. Whilst significantly more patients with a favorable SI-ASPECTS had a good outcome after ET than after IVT (51% vs. 35%, P < 0.01), there was only a non-significant trend towards a good outcome after ET than after IVT in patients with a moderately favorable ASPECTS (25% vs. 14%, P = 0.1). CONCLUSION Patients with extensive early ischaemic changes on CT scans (SI- ASPECTS 5) might not profit from ET. The impact of ET on outcome in patients with moderately favorable SI-ASPECTS should be addressed in further trials.","output":"Impact of ASPECTS on computed tomography angiography source images on outcome after thrombolysis or endovascular therapy in large vessel occlusions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review of 15 patients who tested positive for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) on the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel revealed that the majority were unlikely to have HHV-6 encephalitis.

This review outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. RECENT FINDINGS The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is most highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and most SARS-CoV-2 shedding occurs from the upper respiratory tract. Viral shedding peaks early during infection around the onset of symptoms, before dropping rapidly in most individuals within 7 days of symptom onset, suggesting mucosal inhibition of viral infection. Serum and mucosal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses were found to be strongly correlated in infected patients, whereas correlations were much weaker for immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal IgA responses have been detected in infected cases in the absence of serum antibody responses, with mucosal antibody levels correlating strongly with virus neutralization. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients revealed the induction of mucosal chemokine and cytokine genes, complement pathways, Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription signaling and cytotoxic T cells. SUMMARY Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Further studies are needed to understand how the systemic immunological endpoints measured in vaccination studies translate to mucosal protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Mucosal immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) seizure classification scheme has been periodically updated to improve its reliability and applicability to clinicians and researchers alike.

Administration by continuous infusion has been suggested to optimize antibiotic exposure and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment for ?-lactams. In an observational study, unbound piperacillin concentrations (n = 196) were assessed in 78 critically ill patients following continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam (ratio 8:1). The initial dose of 8, 12, or 16 g (piperacillin component) was determined by individual creatinine clearance (CRCL). Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the EUCAST clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/liter), and the following PK/PD targets were evaluated: 100% free time (fT) > 1 MIC and 100% fT > 4 MIC. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3 consisting of a one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination separated into nonrenal and renal (linearly increasing with patient CRCL) clearances. Target attainment was predicted and visualized for all individuals based on the utilized CRCL dosing algorithm. The target of 100% fT > 1 MIC was achieved for all patients based on the administered dose, but few patients achieved the target of 100% fT > 4 MIC. Probability of target attainment for a simulated cohort of patients showed that increasing the daily dose by 4-g increments (piperacillin component) did not result in substantially improved target attainment for the 100% fT > 4 MIC target. To conclude, in patients with high CRCL combined with high-MIC bacterial infections, even a continuous infusion (CI) regimen with a daily dose of 24 g may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic concentrations.","output":"Population Pharmacokinetics of Piperacillin following Continuous Infusion in Critically Ill Patients and Impact of Renal Function on Target Attainment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) spreads rapidly around the world. Objective: To evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences. Methods: We analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27, 2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases CBVDs (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036). Conclusion: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men.

Healthcare workers in paediatrics are a unique subgroup: they come into frequent contact with children, who often experience few or no symptoms when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, therefore, may transmit the disease to unprotected staff. In Germany, no studies exist evaluating the risk of COVID-19 to healthcare workers in paediatric institutions. METHODS: We tested the staff at a large childrens hospital in Germany for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a period between the first and second epidemic wave in Germany. We used a questionnaire to assess each individuals exposure risk and his/her own perception of having already been infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We recruited 619 participants from all sectors, clinical and non-clinical, constituting 70% of the entire staff. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 0.325% (95% confidence interval 0.039C1.168). Self-perceived risk of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased with age (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.70C0.93). Having experienced symptoms more than doubled the odds of a high self-perceived risk (odds ratio, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.59C3.00). There was no significant difference in self-perceived risk between men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was low among healthcare workers at a large childrens hospital in Germany before the second epidemic wave, and it was far from a level that confers herd immunity.

We investigated associations between diabetes and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastases in obese and nonobese men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods We included 4688 men from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital cohort of men undergoing RP from 1988 to 2017. Diabetes prior to RP, anthropometric, and clinical data were abstracted from 6 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers electronic medical records. Primary and secondary outcomes were PCSM and metastases and CRPC, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (adj-HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for diabetes and PCSM, CRPC, and metastases. Adjusted hazard ratios were also estimated in analyses stratified by obesity (body mass index: nonobese <30 kg/m2; obese 30 kg/m2). All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results Diabetes was not associated with PCSM (adj-HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.86 to 2.24), CRPC (adj-HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.64), or metastases (adj-HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.46), among all men. Interaction terms for diabetes and obesity were statistically significant in multivariable models for PCSM, CRPC, and metastases (P  .04). In stratified analyses, in obese men, diabetes was associated with PCSM (adj-HR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.40 to 6.69), CRPC (adj-HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.11 to 4.15), and metastases (adj-HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.88 to 2.78), though not statistically significant for metastases. In nonobese men, inverse associations were suggested for diabetes and prostate cancer outcomes without reaching statistical significance.

Here, we present data from an M. ovipneumoniae introduction event in the Zion desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) population in southern Utah. The ensuing disease event exhibited epidemiology distinct from what has been reported elsewhere, with virtually no mortality (0 adult mortalities among 70 animals tracked over 118 animal-years; 1 lamb mortality among 40 lambs tracked through weaning in the two summers following introduction; and lamb:ewe ratios of 34.9:100 in the year immediately after introduction and 49.4:100 in the second year after introduction).

A platform which can provide this, whilst still being low cost and simple to use, is paper-based lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA). LFIA combine immunology and chromatography to detect a target by forming an immunocomplex with a label which traps them in a test zone. Qualitative analysis can be performed using the naked eye whilst quantitative analysis takes place by measuring the optical signal provided by the label at the test zone. There are numerous detection methods available; however, many suffer from low sensitivity and lack of multiplexing capabilities or are poor at providing POC quantitative analysis. An attractive method to overcome this is to use nanoparticles coated in Raman reporters as the labelled species and to analyse test zones using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Due to the wide variety of metal nanoparticles, Raman reporter and laser excitations that are available, SERS-based LFIA have been adapted to identify and quantify multiple targets at once. Large Raman microscopes combined with long mapping times have limited the platform to the lab; however, by transferring the analysis to portable Raman instruments, rapid and quantitative measurements can be taken at the POC without any loss in sensitivity.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at >72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until NICU discharge. RESULTS: During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus). By bivariate analysis, the infants with viral detection were older (41 vs 11 days; P = .007), exposed to individuals with respiratory tract viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003), tested for respiratory viruses by provider (75% vs 11%; P < .001), and had lower total neutrophil counts (P = .02).

In addition, various hardware failure scenarios and their management are described. CONCLUSIONS Reprogramming aims to further improve patient symptoms or ensure a comfortable delivery of the therapy. Initial changes of electrode configuration and adjustment of stimulation parameters can be performed at home to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. A logical and stepwise approach to reprogramming can improve the outcome of therapy and restore patient satisfaction.","output":"Reprogramming Sacral Neuromodulation for Sub-Optimal Outcomes: Evidence and Recommendations for Clinical Practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A crucial aspect of continued senior care is the early detection and management of frailty. Developing reliable and secure electronic frailty assessment tools can benefit virtual appointments, a need especially apparent since the COVID-19 pandemic. An emerging effort has targeted web-based software applications to improve accessibility and usage. Methods: : We conducted an environmental scan through MEDLINE and Google searches (last updated on June 1st, 2021) to identify currently available web applications, each of which was evaluated and assigned a rating score based on eight featured categories. Results: : Twelve web-based frailty assessment applications were found, chiefly provided by the USA (50%) or European countries (42%) and focused on frailty grading and outcome prediction for specific patient groups (58%). The categories that scored well among the applications included the User Interface (2.67/3) and the Cost (2.75/3). Other categories had a mean score of 1.5 or lower. The least developed features in the existing web applications included Data Saving. Conclusions: : This is the first study that has compiled a comprehensive list of frailty assessments available online, described their usage and evaluated their advantages and limitations.

With disrupted functional connectivity (FC) of default mode network (DMN) associated with cognitive decline, we speculate that intellectual activities might optimize cognitive function through modulating FC of DMN. This two-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial aims to identify the effects of increasing practice of calligraphy on cognitive function and FC of DMN in people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS: One hundred twelve community-living Chinese aged 55 to 75 years old with SCD but without mild cognitive impairment or dementia and with prior practice of calligraphy as defined by 1 h of calligraphy per week will be recruited through elderly social centres in Hong Kong and randomized into either control or intervention group. The control group will continue with their usual practice of calligraphy, whereas the intervention group will double their practice of calligraphy. Measurement of cognitive outcomes and neuroimaging on resting-state FC will be performed at baseline and in 6 months. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to assess cognitive and FC changes, with time being the within-group factor, control/intervention as the between-group measure, and important covariates (age, sex, educational and occupational attainment, health, and other lifestyle factors) controlled for. DISCUSSION: This study will shed light on the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of how intellectual activities promotes cognitive maintenance. Our anticipated findings will provide evidence that reversing or slowing FC disruption by actively participating in intellectual activities is still possible for the at-risk individuals.

The effect of softer UV-B and UV-A photons, which copiously reach the Earths surface, on viruses are instead little studied, particularly on single-stranded RNA viruses. Here we combine our measurements of the action spectrum of Covid-19 in response to UV light, Solar irradiation measurements on Earth during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, worldwide recorded Covid-19 mortality data and our Solar-Pump diffusive model of epidemics to show that (a) UV-B/A photons have a powerful virucidal effect on the single-stranded RNA virus Covid-19 and that (b) the Solar radiation that reaches temperate regions of the Earth at noon during summers, is sufficient to inactivate 63% of virions in open-space concentrations (1.5  10(3) TCID(50)/mL, higher than typical aerosol) in less than 2 min. We conclude that the characteristic seasonality imprint displayed world-wide by the SARS-Cov-2 mortality time-series throughout the diffusion of the outbreak (with temperate regions showing clear seasonal trends and equatorial regions suffering, on average, a systematically lower mortality), might have been efficiently set by the different intensity of UV-B/A Solar radiation hitting different Earths locations at different times of the year.

A vaccination-challenge test found that vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine strain did not provide protection against challenge with the recombinant viruses. In addition, the results showed that the recombination events between the vaccine and field strains resulted in altered genetics, serotype, antigenicity, and pathogenicity compared with those of their deduced parental viruses.

Due to the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction reagents. Therefore, extraction-free RT-qPCR protocols are urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid RT-qPCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need of RNA extraction suitable for all respiratory materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory materials from our routine laboratory were used as crude material after heat inactivation in direct RT-qPCR with the PrimeDirect&#8482; Probe RT-qPCR Mix (TaKaRa). SARS-CoV-2 was detected using novel primers targeted to the E-gene. RESULTS: The protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in crude material used a prepared frozen-PCR mix with optimized primers and 5 l of fresh, undiluted and pre-analytically heat inactivated respiratory material. For validation, 91 respiratory samples were analyzed in direct comparison to classical RNA-based RT-qPCR. Overall 81.3 % of the samples were detected in both assays with a strong correlation between both Ct values (r = 0.8492, p < 0.0001). The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate by direct RT-qPCR was 95.8 % for Ct values <35. All negative samples were characterized by low viral loads (Ct >35) and/or long storage times before sample processing. CONCLUSION: Direct RT-qPCR is a suitable alternative to classical RNA RT-qPCR, provided that only fresh samples (storage <1 week) are used. RNA extraction should be considered if samples have longer storage times or if PCR inhibition is observed.

RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)- mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210C230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN- promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6C30, 31C55, 56C80, 81C105, 106C130, 131C155, 156C180, 181C205, 206C230, 231C248 or 249C265 lack functions of IFNC mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR.

Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN- suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","output":"Functional Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Encoding a Partial Truncation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The definition of consumerism is multifaceted, extending from the consumption of goods and services (which may be perceived as advantageous to the growth of the economy, both localized and global) to its more negative connotations: the obsessive consumption of goods, exploitation of the people who create them and greed.

Frequent mutations in the viral genome result in viruses with immune escape mutants. Irrespective of regular vaccination, control of PRRSV remains a challenge to swine farmers. In PRRSV-infected pigs, innate cytokine IFN- is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed. To elucidate both cellular and innate cytokine responses at very early stages of PRRSV infection, seven weeks old pigs maintained on a commercial pig farm were infected and analyzed. RESULTS: One pig in a pen containing 25 pigs was PRRSV infected and responses from this pig and one penmate were assessed two days later. All the infected and a few of the contact neighbor pigs were viremic. At day 2 post-infection, approximately 50% of viremic pigs had greater than 50% reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and nearly a 1-fold increase in IFN- production was detected in blood of a few pigs. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 (in ~90%), IL-12 (in ~40%), and IL-10 (in ~20%) (but not IFN-) in PRRSV infected pigs was observed. In addition, reduced frequency of myeloid cells, CD4(-)CD8(+ )T cells, and CD4(+)CD8(+ )T cells and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural T regulatory cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs. Interestingly, all viremic contact pigs also had comparable immune cell modulations. CONCLUSION: Replicating PRRSV in both infected and contact pigs was found to be responsible for rapid modulation in NK cell-meditated cytotoxicity and alteration in the production of important immune cytokines. PRRSV-induced immunological changes observed simultaneously at both cellular and cytokine levels early post-infection appear to be responsible for the delay in generation of adaptive immunity.

We review the potential for both negative and positive impacts these major changes can have on nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). RECENT FINDINGS: Healthcare facilities around the world have reported outbreaks of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast some centres have reported a decrease in baseline rates due to a number of possible factors. SUMMARY: While implementing crucial preventive measures for COVID-19, is it important to consider any collateral effects of changes in IPC and antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) practices. The disruption caused to IPC and ASP practices during the pandemic are likely to see a counter intuitive increase in transmission of MDROs.","output":"MDRO transmission in acute hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and spread of COVID-19 has had a huge negative impact on society.

Methods: A retrospective before-after control study was conducted. From December 2016 to April 2021, 16 patients (7 males and 9 females, aged 3-49 years) with contracture scars causing impaired function of the adjacent joint were admitted to Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Eighteen joint scars of 16 patients were treated with fractional carbon dioxide laser every 2-3 months until the joint retained its normal range of motion or the effect plateaued. The treatment times of each patient were recorded. Before the first intervention and 6 months after the last treatment, the range of motion of the affected joint were measured in each patient, and the difference was calculated, meanwhile, the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was used to evaluate the scar of each patient. In the treatment of 1 joint scar in each of 6 patients (totally 6 treatments), the range of motion before the current treatment, immediately after treatment, and at the first follow-up after treatment was noted, and the differences between the range before and immediately after the treatment as well as the range before and at the first follow-up after treatment were calculated. Adverse effects in the treatment area caused by the treatment were noted. At the last follow-up, a self-made questionnaire was used to collect the implementation status of the physical therapy and other scar management modalities during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Eighteen joint scars in 16 patients went through 2 (1, 3) times of treatments by fractional carbon dioxide laser. The range of motion of the affected joint of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment was 56.5 (39.0, 128.8), notably higher than 38.4 (22.9, 116.3) before the first treatment (Z=-3.724, P<0.01), which was improved by 17.4 (8.0, 24.1). The vascular distribution, softness, and thickness scores, and total score in VSS scoring of scars of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment were significantly lower than those before the first treatment (Z=-2.989, -3.762, -2.814, -3.739, P<0.01), with the most obvious improvement in softness. In 6 treatments, the range of motion immediately after treatment and at the first follow-up of (2.50.6) months after treatment were 156.2 (148.0, 164.2) and 160.2 (156.7, 166.4), both notably higher than 151.4 (145.7, 155.3) before treatment (Z=-2.201, -2.201, P<0.05), which were improved by 9.1 (4.4, 13.0) and 13.1 (8.0, 15.7), respectively. Adverse effects such as blisters, infection, or hypertrophic scar formation was not observed in the treatment area of 16 patients. Most patients adopted physical therapy, compression, silicone gel or sheets, and braces during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Conclusions: The fractional carbon dioxide laser can soften the scar and increase the range of motion of the affected joint, which is suitable for the treatment of mild contracture scars.","output":"[Analysis of treatment effects of fractional carbon dioxide laser on contracture scars]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic induces considerable strain on intensive care unit resources. Objectives: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. Methods: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Measurements: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Main Results: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. Conclusion: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early.

Although the knowledge base regarding children's response to trauma and adverse events has broadened, descriptions of their mental health during epidemics remain scarce. In particular, the role of family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health are poorly understood. Methods We assessed the correlates of children's emotional difficulties and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French community-based sample. 432 community-based parents (27-46 years, TEMPO cohort) and their children (mean age 6.8 +/- 4.1) were interviewed online. Children's symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention were assessed using the parent reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire during the 5th week of home confinement. Family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health and substance use were assessed weekly during the first 5 weeks of home confinement. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Results 7.1% of children presented symptoms of emotional difficulties and 24.7% symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. The presence of psychological difficulties was significantly associated with family characteristics including financial difficulties (OR = 4.3) and parental symptoms of anxiety and depression (OR = 2.5).

One is an NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2) and the other is an NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH3). These two enzymes are part of the nitrogen and nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolic pathways, which have been identified in our previous studies as potentially playing an important role in C. albicans morphogenesis. In this study, we created single gene knockout mutants of both dehydrogenases in order to investigate whether or not they affect the morphogenesis of C. albicans. The GDH genes were deleted and the phenotypes of the knockout mutants were studied by growth characterisation, metabolomics, isotope labelling experiments, and by quantifying cofactors under various hyphae-inducing conditions. We found that the gdh2/gdh2 mutant was unable to grow on either arginine or proline as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. While the gdh3/gdh3 mutant could grow on these carbon and nitrogen sources, the strain was locked in the yeast morphology in proline-containing medium. We detected different concentrations of ATP, NAD(+), NADH, NAPD(+), NADPH, as well as 62 other metabolites, and 19 isotopically labelled metabolites between the mutant and the wild-type strains. These differences were associated with 44 known metabolic pathways. It appears that the disequilibrium of cofactors in the gdh3/gdh3 mutant leads to characteristic proline degradation in the central carbon metabolism. The analysis of the gdh2/gdh2 and the gdh3/gdh3 mutants confirmed our hypothesis that redox potential and nitrogen metabolism are related to filament formation and identified these metabolic pathways as potential drug targets to inhibit morphogenesis.","output":"A metabolomic study of the effect of Candida albicans glutamate dehydrogenase deletion on growth and morphogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented public health emergency, challenged higher education and threatened students well-being in several ways.

Meanwhile, the RLR signaling pathway is also tightly regulated by host and virus to achieve the immune homeostasis between antiviral responses and virus survival. Here, we found that zebrafish TRIM25 (zbTRIM25) functioned as a positive regulator of RLR signaling pathway during red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. Post-RGNNV infection, zbTRIM25 expression was obviously inhibited and ectopic expression of zbTRIM25 led to enhanced expression of RLR signaling pathway-related genes. Overexpression and knockdown analysis revealed that zbTRIM25 promoted zebrafish RIG-I (zbRIG-I)-mediated IFN signaling and inhibited RGNNV replication. Mechanistically, zbTRIM25 bound to zbRIG-I; in particular, the SPRY domain of zbTRIM25 interacted with the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD) and repressor domain (RD) regions of zbRIG-I. zbTRIM25 promoted the K63 polyubiquitination of 2CARD and RD regions of zbRIG-I. Furthermore, zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I activation of IFN production was enhanced by K63-linked ubiquitin, indicating that zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I polyubiquitination was essential for RIG-I-triggered IFN induction. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that zbTRIM25 positively regulates the innate immune response by targeting and promoting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of zbRIG-I.","output":"Zebrafish TRIM25 Promotes Innate Immune Response to RGNNV Infection by Targeting 2CARD and RD Regions of RIG-I for K63-Linked Ubiquitination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are undergoing several clinical trials for evaluating their efficacy and safety as antiviral drugs.

We, hereby, hypothesize the success of the intranasal and the pulmonary routes through a gelatin matrix to overcome several challenges related to CQ and HCQ pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties and to increase their local concentrations at the sites of initial viral entry while minimizing the potential side effects. Molecular docking on the gelatin-simulated matrix demonstrated high loading values and a sustained release profile. Moreover, the docking on mucin as well as various receptors including Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), heparin sulphate proteoglycan and Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), which are expressed in the lung and intranasal tissues and represent initial sites of attachment of the viral particles to the surface of respiratory cells, has shown good binding of CQ and HCQ to these receptors.

Eleven autopsy reports that demonstrated thromboembolic involvement findings, either macroscopically or microscopically, were included in this review. All studies reported similar pulmonary gross findings. Not all studies described thrombi formation and megakaryocyte findings. Pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, severe endothelial injury, and widespread thrombosis are frequent in COVID-19 patients, following many patients with high-level D-Dimer, increased fibrinogen, abnormal prothrombic coagulation, and thrombocytopenia. Reports showed that thrombus was also found in the lower extremities' deep veins and the prostatic venous plexus.

They formed pro- and anti-vaccination groups toward the purpose of influencing behaviors to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. The methods of persuasion and manipulation for convincing audiences online can be characterized under a framework for social-cyber maneuvers known as the BEND maneuvers. Previous studies have been conducted on the spread of COVID-19 vaccine disinformation. However, these previous studies lacked comparative analyses over time on both community stances and the competing techniques of manipulating both the narrative and network structure to persuade target audiences. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand community response to vaccination by dividing Twitter data from the initial Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine rollout into pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine stances, identifying key actors and groups, and evaluating how the different communities use social-cyber maneuvers, or BEND maneuvers, to influence their target audiences and the network as a whole. METHODS: COVID-19 Twitter vaccine data were collected using the Twitter application programming interface (API) for 1-week periods before, during, and 6 weeks after the initial Pfizer-BioNTech rollout (December 2020 to January 2021). Bot identifications and linguistic cues were derived for users and tweets, respectively, to use as metrics for evaluating social-cyber maneuvers. Organization Risk Analyzer (ORA)-PRO software was then used to separate the vaccine data into pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine communities and to facilitate identification of key actors, groups, and BEND maneuvers for a comparative analysis between each community and the entire network. RESULTS: Both the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine communities used combinations of the 16 BEND maneuvers to persuade their target audiences of their particular stances. Our analysis showed how each side attempted to build its own community while simultaneously narrowing and neglecting the opposing community. Pro-vaccine users primarily used positive maneuvers such as excite and explain messages to encourage vaccination and backed leaders within their group. In contrast, anti-vaccine users relied on negative maneuvers to dismay and distort messages with narratives on side effects and death and attempted to neutralize the effectiveness of the leaders within the pro-vaccine community. Furthermore, nuking through platform policies showed to be effective in reducing the size of the anti-vaccine online community and the quantity of anti-vaccine messages. CONCLUSIONS: Social media continues to be a domain for manipulating beliefs and ideas. These conversations can ultimately lead to real-world actions such as to vaccinate or not to vaccinate against COVID-19. Moreover, social media policies should be further explored as an effective means for curbing disinformation and misinformation online.","output":"Social-Cyber Maneuvers During the COVID-19 Vaccine Initial Rollout: Content Analysis of Tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is imperative in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that we serve our patients by implementing teleneurology visits for those who require neurologic advice but do not need to be seen face to face The authors propose a thorough, practical, in-home, teleneurologic examination that can be completed without the assistance of an on-the-scene medical professional and can be tailored to the clinical question We hope to assist trainees and practicing neurologists doing patient video visits for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on what can, rather than what cannot, be easily examined","output":"Primer on the In-home Teleneurologic Examination: A COVID-19 Pandemic Imperative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Image, graphical","output":"In Silico Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activities of Five-membered Heterocycle-substituted Benzimidazoles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been much debate on the issue of whether online learning was better than traditional education and vice-versa over the past decade. Over time, the concept of blended learning became quite the norm, especially within traditional universities who could no longer turn a blind eye to the educational revolution brought about by information and communication technologies. While the pace of technology integration in universities generally varies in pace, the world has recently experienced a massive uptake, albeit in an unplanned and mostly disorganized manner, of e-learning technologies due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Researchers have emphasized on the quality of online courses from a perspective of learner achievement in terms of student satisfaction, engagement and performances. In this paper, we analyze student feedback and report the findings of a study of the relationships between student satisfaction and their engagement in an online course with their overall performances. The module was offered online to 844 university students in the first year across different disciplines, namely Engineering, Science, Humanities, Management and Agriculture. It was assessed mainly through continuous assessments and was designed using a learning-by-doing pedagogical approach. The focus was on the acquisition of new skills and competencies, and their application in authentic mini-projects throughout the module. Student feedback was coded and analyzed both from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. The association between satisfaction and engagement was significant and positively correlated. On the other hand, there was a weak but positive and significant correlation between satisfaction or engagement with their overall performances. We further observed that students were generally very satisfied with the learning design philosophy, irrespective of their performance levels. Students, however, reported issues related to lack of tutor support and experiencing technical difficulties across groups. The findings raise important implications for institutional e-learning policy making. The factors that are important relate to the object of such policies, learning design models, personalized support, distributed virtual learning through synchronous interaction, and learning analytics.","output":"Learner satisfaction, engagement and performances in an online module: Implications for institutional e-learning policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hemodialysis patients not only suffer from somatic disorders but are also at high risks of psychiatric problems. Early this year, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great panic and anxiety worldwide. The impact of this acute public health event on the psychological status of hemodialysis patients and its relationship with their quality of life have not been fully investigated. Methods: This study comprised two parts. The initial study enrolled maintenance hemodialysis patients treated in Ruijin Hospital for more than 3 months from March to May 2020 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients completed three questionnaires including the Impact of Events ScaleCRevised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) Short Form (SF). Follow-up study was performed from December 2020 to January 2021, when the pandemic of COVID-19 has been effectively contained in China. Only patients enrolled in the initial study were approached to participate in the follow-up study. Results: There were 273 maintenance dialysis patients enrolled in the initial study and 247 finished the follow-up study. For the initial study, the estimated prevalence of nonspecific psychiatric morbidity was 45.8% (125/273) by GHQ-28. By IES-R, 53/273 (19.4%) patients presented with total scores above 24 that reflected clinical concerns. We found a significant difference regarding KDQOL scores between patients with different stress response (IES-R) groups (p = 0.026). Our follow-up study showed that KDQOL and SF-36 scores were significantly improved in comparison with those in the initial study (p = 0.006 and p = 0.031, respectively). Though total scores of GHQ-28 and IES-R did not change significantly, some subscales improved with statistical significance. Furthermore, gender, education background, and duration of hemodialysis were three factors that may affect patients' mental health, quality of life, or health status while dialysis duration was the only variable that correlated with those parameters. However, these correlations were combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dialysis itself. Conclusions: We found a correlation between changes in the mental health status of dialysis patients and changes in their quality of life.

The national-wide lockdown in Tunisia, from Mars to Mai 2020 had substantially decreased healthcare accessibility and drugs availability. In addition, the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was likely to lead to anxiety and negative emotional and behavioral reactions which are thought to be predictors of active IBD and relapses. We aimed to assess the hospital admission and complication rates in patients with IBD during the first wave of COIVD-19 infection in Tunisia and to compare them to those observed during the same period one year earlier. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of patients with IBD admitted to our department during the period of time following the national lock-down in Tunisia ( from Mai, the 4th to August, the 31th). We compared the total global admission rate, IBD related complications, surgery rates and postoperative complications between the study period (P1) and the corresponding period of the previous year (P2 : from Mai, the 4th to August, the 31th, 2019). The Chi square test and Fisher exact test were used for analysis of categorical data. RESULTS: Eighty patients with IBD were included in this study (44 patients in P1 and 36 patients in P2), 73.7% of which (n=59) had Crohn disease. The sex ratio was 1.16 and the mean age was33.8 years  11.9. The mean follow-up period was 5 years. In 17.5% of cases (n=14), the IBD was diagnosed during the admission. None of the P1 patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of hospitalizations during P1 was 2.6 per week. It was greater than that of P2 but without the difference being statistically significant (2.1 admissions per week; incidence rate ratio: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.67-1.2; p = 0, 54). A total of 31 complications were noted (19 in P1 vs 12 in P2; p=0,489). The complications were as follows: 19 cases of acute severe colitis (12 in P1 vs 7 in P2 ; p= 0,234), 8 cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (6 in P1 vs 2 in P2 ; p=0,234), 4 cases of acute intestinal obstruction (1 in P1 vs 3 in P2 ; p=0,322). Among patients who had presented an acute severe colitis, 6 had undergone subtotal colectomy (6 in P1 vs 0 in P2, p=0,006). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that during the pandemic period, there was an increase in the incidence of hospitalizations of patients with IBD as well as a significant increase in the need for surgery in severe acute colitis. These results should be taken into account so that IBD management strategies can be adjusted accordingly, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or recurs, or in case of future outbreaks.","output":"P186 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Care in the Covid-19 pandemic era: Experience from a Tunisian gastroenterology department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to maternal and newborn health has yet to be determined.

This virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, has infected tens of thousands of people. Based on symptoms, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory illness is responsible for highly homogenous coronaviruses as well as other pathogens. Evidence suggests that high inflammation rates, oxidation, and overwhelming immune response probably contribute to pathology of COVID-19. COVID-19 causes cytokine storm, which subsequently leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often ending up in the death of patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotential stem cells that are recognized via self-renewal capacity, generation of clonal populations, and multilineage differentiation. MSCs are present in nearly all tissues of the body, playing an essential role in repair and generation of tissues. Furthermore, MSCs have broad immunoregulatory properties through the interaction of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immune systems, leading to immunosuppression of many effector activities. MSCs can reduce the cytokine storm produced by coronavirus infection. In a number of studies, the administration of these cells has been beneficial for COVID-19 patients. Also, MSCs may be able to improve pulmonary fibrosis and lung function.

AIM To report the implementation and impact of an eight-week multifaceted mindfulness-based self-care program on medical students' distress and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred twenty-three fourth-year medical students attended the program as part of a mandatory course from April to May 2020, during the rising phase of COVID-19 in Chile. They were evaluated using validated tests before and immediately after the program. The measures included burnout, dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, traumatic stress reactions, general well-being, resilience, and stress coping strategies. RESULTS Burnout prevalence decreased from 48% to 24%, whereas students with high dispositional mindfulness increased from 25% to 44%. Burnout reduction was mostly due to decreased emotional exhaustion. Additionally, students reported lower levels of stress, self-blaming, and traumatic stress reactions alongside an increased use of active coping strategies and resilience levels after the program. CONCLUSIONS A formal educational intervention, teaching self-awareness and self-regulation skills can help reduce medical students' distress and promote their well-being even amidst a pandemic.","output":"Reduced burnout and higher mindfulness in medical students after a self-care program during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It remains unclear how effective COVID-19 vaccinations will be in patients with weakened immunity due to diseases, transplantation, and dialysis.

A literature search was conducted twice using the Medline/PubMed database. As a result, 21 papers were included in the review, and seropositivity rate was summarized by specific type of disease, transplantation, and dialysis. When different papers studied the same type of patient group, a study with a higher number of participants was selected. Most of the solid tumor patients showed a seropositivity rate of more than 80% after the second inoculation, but a low seropositivity was found in certain tumors such as breast cancer. Research in patients with certain types of hematological malignancy and autoimmune diseases has also reported low seropositivity, and this may have been affected by the immunosuppressive treatment these patients receive. Research in patients receiving dialysis or transplantation has reported lower seropositivity rates than the general population, while all patients with inflammatory bowel disease have converted to be seropositive.

This resulted in decreased exercise tolerance, in addition to ongoing complex psychological and health concerns. There is significant evidence to support PR as a means of improving mental and physical health in many respiratory conditions. 2 A bespoke face to face COVID-19 pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme was therefore setup to maximise patient recovery.Aim: 1. To assess the impact of PR on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. 2. To assess the impact of PR on six minute walk test, sit to stand test and Borg dyspnoea score 3. To identify patients most likely to benefit from PR in the future.Method: Patients were identified as 'severe COVID-19' and referred for PR following a consultant case review of patients requiring non-invasive and invasive ventilation in either the respiratory high care unit (RHCU) or intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were then assessed by a multidisciplinary team to ensure consent and appropriateness for the PR programme.Patients completed MFIS and were assessed on a variety of other physical and psychological measures, including: six minute walk test, sit to stand test and Borg dyspnoea score. During weekly PR sessions the patients engaged with a tailored programme of cardio and strengthening exercises as well as Pilates to improve movement and flexibility. Patients repeated the assessments after six weeks.Results: A total of 31 patients attended the programme. 97% of patients attended 80-100% of sessions. The median change in total MFIS was -16%.

In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus. Following infection, BCV was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and, after three weeks in the study, all had seroconverted to this virus. All calves, including the controls, showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3C15 after the trial started: fever (40C), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed that BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.","output":"Failure to Spread Bovine Virus Diarrhoea Virus Infection from Primarily Infected Calves Despite Concurrent Infection with Bovine Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, active cancer has been identified as a potential risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including thrombosis. However, the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with a remote history of cancer is poorly understood. We evaluated hospitalized patients with a history of remote cancer and COVID-19 to examine whether a history of cancer contributes to 30-day major adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort of 1114 patients from CORONA-VTE (Registry of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications in Patients With COVID-19), we looked at 399 hospitalized patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 within a large heath care network that consists of two large academic medical centers and several community hospitals. Twenty-six patients with active cancer or receiving cancer treatment within 1-year of COVID-19 diagnosis and five patients with unknown cancer history were excluded. We assessed 46 patients with a history of cancer and 322 patients without any history of cancer. The primary endpoint was the frequency of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 46 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a history of cancer, 23.9% were non-white and 43.48% women. Compared to patients without any history of cancer, patients with a history of cancer were older (median 59.0 vs. 75.5 years, p<0.001) and had higher BMI (median 26.4 vs. 29.6 kg/m(2), p<0.05). Patients with a history of cancer had higher rates of underlying CVD than those without (42.4% vs. 23.2%). Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events were similar in patients with and without a history of cancer (28.3% vs. 23.6%, respectively). Those with a history of cancer had a higher mortality rate (28.9% vs. 11.2%, p<0.05). Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and preexisting CVD were independently associated with mortality in this patient cohort (OR 19.7, 95% CI 7.5C51.7 and OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2C6.9). History of remote cancer was not independently associated with mortality (OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.93C6.15, p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a history of remote cancer is not independently associated with increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that the cause of death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and history of cancer is most likely multifactorial, with a strong contribution from cardiovascular disease.

This is usually attributed to a data mismatch between the data used to train and test the ML model and the data it encounters in the real world, a phenomenon known as data shift. However, a physics-based ML model integrates data, partial differential equations (PDEs), and mathematical models to solve data shift problems. Physics-based ML models are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear equations.

This study aimed to see whether epidural analgesia (EA) has superior clinical outcomes compared with non-epidural alternatives (N-EA) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. On 28 August 2018, relevant literature databases were searched. Primary outcomes were pain scores. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure of initial analgesia, complications, duration of hospital stay and mortality. Results Three RCTs and eight cohort studies (25 089 patients) were included. N-EA treatments studied were: intravenous morphine, continuous wound infiltration, bilateral paravertebral thoracic catheters and intrathecal morphine. Patients receiving EA had a marginally lower pain score on days 0-3 after surgery than those receiving intravenous morphine (mean difference (MD) -050, 95 per cent c.i. -080 to -021; P < 0001) and similar pain scores to patients who had continuous wound infiltration.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether frailty, measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale, is associated with mortality after cardiopulmonary resuscitation following in-hospital cardiac arrest in older adults in the USA. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS Patients  65 years who had undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation during an inpatient admission at two urban academic hospitals and three suburban community hospitals within a Boston area healthcare system from January 2018-January 2020. Patients with Clinical Frailty Scale scores 1-3 were considered not frail, 4-6 were considered very mildly, mildly, and moderately frail, respectively, and 7-9 were considered severely frail. MAIN MEASURES In-hospital mortality after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. KEY RESULTS Among 324 patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation following in-hospital cardiac arrest, 73.1% experienced in-hospital mortality. Patients with a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 1-3 had 54% in-hospital mortality, which increased to 66%, 78%, 84%, and 84% for those with a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 4, 5, 6, and 7-9, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, race, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, higher frailty scores were significantly associated with higher odds of in-hospital mortality. Compared to those with a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 1-3, odds ratios (95% CI) for in-hospital mortality for patients with a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 4, 5, 6, and 7-9 were 1.6 (0.8-3.3), 3.0 (1.3-7.1), 4.4 (1.9-9.9), and 4.6 (1.8-11.8), respectively (p = 0.001).

Preventive behavior is associated with a number of factors that both encourage and discourage prevention. Aim: The aim of this research was to study COVID-19 threat appraisal, fear of COVID-19, trust in COVID-19 information sources, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and the relationship of socio-demographic variables (gender, age, level of education, place of residence, and employment status) to COVID-19 preventive behavior. Methods: The data originate from a national cross-sectional online survey (N = 2,608) undertaken in July 2020. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: COVID-19 threat appraisal, trust in COVID-19 information sources, and fear of COVID-19 are all significant predictors of COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Together they explain 26.7% of the variance of this variable. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs significantly negatively predict COVID-19 threat appraisal (R(2) = 0.206) and trust in COVID-19 information sources (R(2) = 0.190). COVID-19 threat appraisal contributes significantly and directly to the explanation of the fear of COVID-19 (R(2) = 0.134). Directly, as well as mediated by COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, threat appraisal predicts trust in COVID-19 information sources (R(2) = 0.190). The relationship between COVID-19 threat appraisal and COVID-19 preventive behaviors is partially mediated by fear of COVID-19 (indirect effect 28.6%) and trust in information sources (15.8%). Socio-demographic variables add very little in prediction of COVID-19 preventive behavior. Conclusions: The study results demonstrate that COVID-19 threat appraisal is the most important factor associated with COVID-19 preventive behavior. Those Latvian residents with higher COVID-19 threat appraisal, experienced higher levels of fear of COVID-19, had more trust in COVID-19 information sources, and were more actively involved in following COVID-19 preventive behaviors. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs negatively predict COVID-19 threat appraisal and trust in COVID-19 information sources, but not the COVID-19 preventive behaviors.

The non-structural proteins of the viral replication complex are thought to be associated with these newly synthesized membranes. We studied this phenomenon, using a Huh7.5 cell clone displaying high levels of replication of a subgenomic replicon of the JFH-1 strain. Electron microscopy of ultrathin sections of these cells revealed the presence of numerous double membrane vesicles (DMVs), resembling those observed for other RNA viruses such as poliovirus and coronavirus. Some sections had more discrete multivesicular units consisting of circular concentric membranes organized into clusters surrounded by a wrapping membrane. These structures were highly specific to HCV as they were not detected in naive Huh7.5 cells. Preparations enriched in these structures were separated from other endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes by cell cytoplasm homogenization and ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient. They were found to contain the non-structural NS3 and NS5A HCV proteins, HCV RNA and LC3-II, a specific marker of autophagic membranes. By analogy to other viral models, HCV may induce DMVs by activating the autophagy pathway. This could represent a strategy to conceal the viral RNA and help the virus to evade double-stranded RNA-triggered host antiviral responses. More detailed characterization of these virus-cell interactions may facilitate the development of new treatments active against HCV and other RNA viruses that are dependent on newly synthesized cellular membranes for replication.","output":"Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses of hepatitis C virus-associated host cell membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our research reports an empirical analysis of a path model linking job insecurity to organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) via two mediators, that is, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction.

A sample of employees in service companies based in Canada was surveyed. We utilized a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, which included path analysis and multi-group analysis (MGA) to test proposed hypotheses. We found that job insecurity negatively predicted intrinsic motivation which positively related to job satisfaction. Job satisfaction influenced OCBs positively. Both intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction mediated the indirect effects of job insecurity onto OCBs. Generation X was more pronounced in their reaction to job insecurity than later generations given the strong negative effects on intrinsic motivation and hence on their job. However, generation Z employees followed their parents from generation X regarding engaging more in OCBs when they are satisfied with their job than generation Y. In general, therefore, it should come as no surprise that generation X employees' OCBs can be expected to plummet due to the elevated levels of job insecurity during pandemic times (e.g., COVID-19) more intensely than Generation Y.

This article focuses on a subset of multiphase flows called particle-laden suspensions involving non-deforming particles in a carrier fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions in these flows result in rich multiscale physics, such as clustering and pseudo-turbulence, with important practical implications. Theoretical formulations to represent, explain and predict these phenomena encounter peculiar challenges that multiphase flows pose for classical statistical mechanics. A critical analysis of existing approaches leads to the identification of key desirable characteristics that a formulation must possess in order to be successful at representing these physical phenomena. The need to build accurate closure models for unclosed terms that arise in statistical theories has motivated the development of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR--DNS) for model-free simulation at the microscale. A critical perspective on outstanding questions and potential limitations of PR-DNS for model development is provided. Selected highlights of recent progress using PR-DNS to discover new multiphase flow physics and develop models are reviewed. Alternative theoretical formulations and extensions to current formulations are outlined as promising future research directions.

Ultimate flood impact data, such as flood inundation maps and insurance claims, becomes available only weeks and months after the floods have receded. Crisis response managers, however, need near-real-time data to prioritize emergency response. This time lag creates a need for rapid flood impact assessment. Some recent studies have shown promising results for using human activity fluctuations as indicators of flood impacts. Existing studies, however, used mainly a single community-scale activity feature for the estimation of flood impacts and have not investigated their temporal importance for indicating flood impacts. Hence, in this study, we examined the importance of heterogeneous human activity features in different flood event stages. Using four community-scale big data categories we derived ten features related to the variations in human activity and evaluated their temporal importance for rapid assessment of flood impacts. Using multiple random forest models, we examined the temporal importance of each feature in indicating the extent of flood impacts in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Our findings reveal that 1) fluctuations in human activity index and percentage of congested roads are the most important indicators for rapid flood impact assessment during response and recovery stages; 2) variations in credit card transactions assumed a middle ranking; and 3) patterns of geolocated social media posts (Twitter) were of low importance across flood stages.

This retrospective study describes the baseline characteristics and outcome data of COVID-19 infection in 650 patients with plasma cell disorders, collected by the International Myeloma Society to understand the initial challenges faced by myeloma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were performed for hospitalized MM patients. Among hospitalized patients, the median age was 69 years, and nearly all patients (96%) had MM. Approximately 36% were recently diagnosed (2019-2020), and 54% of patients were receiving first-line therapy. Thirty-three percent of patients have died, with significant geographic variability, ranging from 27% to 57% of hospitalized patients. Univariate analysis identified age, International Staging System stage 3 (ISS3), high-risk disease, renal disease, suboptimal myeloma control (active or progressive disease), and 1 or more comorbidities as risk factors for higher rates of death. Neither history of transplant, including within a year of COVID-19 diagnosis, nor other anti-MM treatments were associated with outcomes. Multivariate analysis found that only age, high-risk MM, renal disease, and suboptimal MM control remained independent predictors of adverse outcome with COVID-19 infection. The management of MM in the era of COVID-19 requires careful consideration of patient- and disease-related factors to decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, while not compromising disease control through appropriate MM treatment. This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of MM patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Clinical features associated with COVID-19 outcome in multiple myeloma: first results from the International Myeloma Society data set."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization claims (WHO),Corona Viruses the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a nationwide crisis, wearing a mask on a face in public places is an effective protection measure.

The research methodology was based on Google and PubMed searches and a qualification process based on a standard checklist and an evaluation of eligibility based on parameters with five score levels applied by two experts (plus one in case of discrepancy). The three points of view stressed the key role of social media as a dissemination tool of the infodemic among citizens. The impact on citizens depends on various social factors and involves indirect (e.g., vaccine avoidance) and direct risks such as mental problems and the risk of suicide. The widespread diffusion of social media, conveyed by mobile technologies, also suggests their use as countermeasures, calibrated based on citizens level of both technological and health literacy. Effective and promising countermeasures in this direction are based both on initiatives of contact by apps or SMS and the collection of data based on surveys and finalized to the particular intervention.

METHODS Oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the target exons and the flanking intron sequences of 29,214 bp from 11 genes associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) were tiled on 20 x 25-microm microarrays (arRP-I arrays). A total of 155 exons were amplified from 35 arRP patient DNA samples, with each sample being sequenced on an arRP-I chip by hybridization. RESULTS With the arRP-I arrays, 97.6% of the tiled sequence were determined with more than 99% accuracy and reproducibility. Of the 2.4% unread sequence, 89.5% involved stretches of G or C. In analyzing the 903,140-bp sequence from the 35 patient samples, 506 sequence changes have been detected in which 386 are previously reported alterations, and 120 are novel. In addition to four known causative mutations, six novel sequence changes that are potentially pathogenic were observed. Additional analysis is needed to determine whether these changes are responsible for arRP in these patients. CONCLUSIONS The use of microarray for sequencing is a novel approach, and the arRP-I chip is the first successful application of this technology for determining sequence alteration in multiple disease-related genes. These arrays can be used for high-throughput genotyping of patients with relevant retinal conditions. In addition, these arrays offer a unique opportunity to interrogate complex patterns of inheritance due to the involvement of more than one gene by screening multiple genes on a single platform.","output":"Sequencing arrays for screening multiple genes associated with early-onset human retinal degenerations on a high-throughput platform."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the immunological adaptation to pregnancy.

Twenty\\\\nine AMH and one donkey were present on the farm when the outbreak occurred. One 10\\\\year\\\\old Quarter Horse mare, stabled at a separate location and owned by an employee of the farm, also tested positive. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of BCoV was performed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell on all faecal samples. The PCR assay used detects multiple beta coronaviruses, including, but not limited to, equine enteric coronavirus (ECoV). Novel findings regarding this BCoV infection in horses were recognised in this outbreak study. To the authors knowledge, this is the largest outbreak of BCoV described thus far in a closed herd on a single premise. The case fatality rate was 0% unlike that described in a previous outbreak of ECoV involving miniature horses and a miniature donkey (Fielding et al. 2015). The morbidity rate was lower in this outbreak than in previously described studies (Oue et al. 2013; Pusterla et al. 2013). This outbreak also demonstrated the potential for BCoV transmission via farm personnel. The duration of shedding of virus in the faeces among some asymptomatic horses in this outbreak was longer than previously described clinical cases of ECoV (Pusterla et al. 2013; Nemoto et al. 2014). This study suggests that asymptomatic animals may play a role in the maintenance of BCoV during an outbreak; therefore, the need for diagnostic testing of both clinically affected and apparently clinically normal horses on a premises followed by appropriate biosecurity and control measures.","output":"Novel findings from a beta coronavirus outbreak on an American Miniature Horse breeding farm in upstate New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than a quarter of working-age households in the United States do not have sufficient savings to cover their expenditures after a month of unemployment.

We tried to study the usage of HFNO in patients with moderate to severe ARDS related to Covid-19 outside the ICU as well as its benefits both for patients and to offload the ICU. Methods: We started a project to use HFNO in the ward of infectious diseases at S?dersjukhuset, Stockholm.

The patients were observed with frequent controls to assess the need of ICU in case of deterioration. The aim was mainly to offload the ICU. Results: We studied 41 patients who were admitted for getting HFNO treatment either as primary treatment (Step-Up) or after stabilizing in the ICU (Step-Down). We studied the patients characteristics and the treatments result and compared it to a subgroup of patients who did not survive this treatment. Most of our patients were men (80%). They had at least one chronic disease (61%).

They are easily available with little to no side effects when compared to modern medicine. This manuscript encompasses information on ethnomedicinal plants in Champhai district, located in the North East Region (NER) of India. The region lies within Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. This study will be the first quantitative report on the ethnomedicinal plants used by the local tribes of this region. Knowledge of medicinal plants is mostly acquired by word of mouth, and the knowledge is dying among the local youths with the prevalence of modern medicine. Hence, there is urgency in deciphering and recording such information. METHODS: Information was gathered through interviews with 200 informants across 15 villages of the Champhai district. From the data obtained, we evaluate indices such as used report (UR), frequency of citation (FC), informant consensus factor (F(ic)), cultural values (CVs) and relative importance (RI) for all the plant species. Secondary data were obtained from scientific databases such as Pubmed, Sci Finder and Science Direct. The scientific name of the plants was matched and arranged in consultation with the working list of all plant species (http://www.theplantlist.org). RESULTS: Totally, 93 plant species from 53 families and 85 genera were recorded. The most common families are Euphorbiaceae and Asteraceae with six and five species representatives, respectively. Leaves were the most frequently used part of a plant and were usually used in the form of decoction. Curcuma longa has the most cultural value (27.28 CVs) with the highest used report (136 FC), and the highest RI value was Phyllanthus emblica. The main illness categories as per Frequency of citation were muscle/bone problem (0.962 F(ic)), gastro-intestinal disease (0.956 F(ic)) and skin care (0.953 F(ic)). CONCLUSION: The people of Mizoram living in the Champhai district have an immense knowledge of ethnomedicinal plants. There were no side effects recorded for consuming ethnomedicinal plants. We observed that there is a scope of scientific validation of 10 plant species for their pharmacological activity and 13 species for the phytochemical characterisation or isolation of the phytochemicals. This might pave the path for developing a scientifically validated botanical or lead to semisyntheic derivatives intended for modern medicine.","output":"Ethnomedicinal study of medicinal plants used by Mizo tribes in Champhai district of Mizoram, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients infected with COVID-19.

Our goals are to facilitate a) primary care providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally informed care of depression, and b) patients' knowledge of and resources for receiving treatment for depression. Our two-year long intervention targets Asian American and Latino American adult (18 years of age or older) primary care patients at MGH screening positive for symptoms of depression. All eligible patients in the intervention arm of the study who screen positive will be offered a culturally focused psychiatric (CFP) consultation. Patients will meet with a study clinician and receive toolkits that include psychoeducational booklets, worksheets and community resources. Within two weeks of the initial consultation, patients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clinicians. Primary outcomes will determine the feasibility and cost associated with implementation of the service, and evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the CFP service. Exploratory aims will describe the study population at screening, recruitment, and enrollment and identify which variables influenced patient participation in the program. DISCUSSION The study involves an innovative yet practical intervention that builds on existing resources and strives to improve quality of care for depression for minorities. Additionally, it complements the current movement in psychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in primary care settings. If found beneficial, the intervention will serve as a model for care of Asian American and Latino American patients.","output":"A study of a culturally focused psychiatric consultation service for Asian American and Latino American primary care patients with depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing influenza in children aged 5 years and under can be challenging because of their difficulty in verbalizing symptoms. This study aimed to explore the value of the triage heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and temperature, either alone or when combined with individual symptoms and signs, in predicting influenza infection in this age group. This was a retrospective study covering 4 influenza seasons from 2017 to 2019 in an emergency department (ED) in Hong Kong. We recruited patients 5 years of age who had an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction influenza test within 48 hours of ED presentation. The diagnostic performance of the triage HR, RR, and temperature was evaluated as dichotomized or categorized values with diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) calculated based on different age-appropriate thresholds. Linear discriminant analysis was performed to assess the combined discriminatory effect of age, HR, RR, and temperature as continuous variables. Of 322 patients (median age 26 months), 99 had influenza A and 13 had influenza B infection. For HR and RR dichotomized based on age-appropriate thresholds, the DORs ranged from 1.16 to 1.54 and 0.78 to 1.53, respectively. A triage temperature 39.0 C had the highest DOR (3.32) among different degrees of elevation of temperature. The diagnostic criteria that were based on the presence of fever and cough and/or rhinitis symptoms had a higher DOR compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness criteria (4.42 vs 2.41). However, combining HR, RR, or temperature with such diagnostic criteria added very little to the diagnostic performance. The linear discriminant analysis model had a high specificity of 92.5%, but the sensitivity (18.3%) was too low for clinical use. Triage HR, RR, and temperature had limited value in the diagnosis of influenza in children 5 years of age in the ED. Fever and cough and/or rhinitis symptoms had a better diagnostic performance than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness criteria in predicting influenza in this age group.","output":"The limited value of triage vital signs in predicting influenza infection in children aged 5 years and under in the emergency department: A single-center retrospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth in the airline industry, which started in 2009, continued until the COVID-19 era, with the annual number of passengers almost doubling in 10 years. This situation has led to increased competition between airline companies, whose profitability has decreased considerably. They aimed to increase their profitability by making services like seat selection, excess baggage, Wi-Fi access optional under the name of ancillary services. To the best of our knowledge, there is no recommendation system for recommending ancillary services for airline companies. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there is no testing framework to compare recommendation algorithms considering their scalabilities and running times. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Lambda architecture for recommendation systems that run on a big data processing platform. The proposed method utilizes association rule and sequential pattern mining algorithms that are designed for big data processing platforms. To facilitate testing of the proposed method, we implement a prototype application. We conduct an experimental study on the prototype to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology using accuracy, scalability, and latency related performance metrics. The results indicate that the proposed method proves to be useful and has negligible processing overheads. ? 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","output":"Scalable recommendation systems based on finding similar items and sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adolescents can develop a severe form of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially with underlying comorbidities.

The key eligibility criterion was a healthy clinical condition or stable pre-existing comorbidity. The anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) antibody concentration at 4 weeks after dose 2 of the vaccine was compared between participants aged 12 to 17 years and those aged 18 to 30 years. Safety profiles included adverse events within 7 days after each dose of the vaccine and any adverse events through 1 month after dose 2 of the vaccine. In the adolescent and adult cohorts, the geometric mean concentration of anti-RBD antibody was 102.9 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL (95% CI, 91.0C116.4) and 36.9 BAU/mL (95% CI, 30.9C44.0), respectively. The geometric mean ratio of the adolescent cohort was 2.79 (95% CI, 2.25C3.46, p < 0.0001) compared with the adult cohort, meeting the non-inferiority criterion.

We investigated differences in LOS, discharge disposition, and charges between hospitalizations for serious infections in patients with and without OUD. METHODS AND FINDINGS We utilized the 2016 National Inpatient Sample-a nationally representative database of all discharges from US acute care hospitals. The population of interest was all hospitalizations for infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. The exposure was OUD, and the primary outcome was LOS until discharge, assessed by using a competing risks analysis to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of discharge disposition and adjusted differences in hospital charges were also reported. Of 95,470 estimated hospitalizations for serious infections (infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis), the mean age was 49 years and 35% were female. 46% had Medicare (government-based insurance coverage for people age 65+ years), and 70% were non-Hispanic white. After adjustment for potential confounders, OUD was associated with a lower probability of discharge at any given LOS (aHR 0.61; 95% CI 0.59-0.63; p < 0.001). OUD was also associated with lower odds of discharge to home (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.43; p < 0.001) and higher odds of discharge to a post-acute care facility (aOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.57-2.17; p < 0.001) or patient-directed discharge (also referred to as \\"discharge against medical advice\\") (aOR 3.47; 95% CI 2.80-4.29; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in average total hospital charges, though daily hospital charges were significantly lower for patients with OUD. Limitations include the potential for unmeasured confounders and the use of billing codes to identify cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that among hospitalizations for some serious infections, those involving patients with OUD were associated with longer LOS, higher odds of discharge to post-acute care facilities or patient-directed discharge, and similar total hospital charges, despite lower daily charges. These findings highlight opportunities to improve care for patients with OUD hospitalized with serious infections, and to reduce the growing associated costs.","output":"Disparities in United States hospitalizations for serious infections in patients with and without opioid use disorder: A nationwide observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many new viruses have emerged in the last five decades. These newer genetically active agents have a major impact on the public health systems worldwide. Most emerging infections appear to be caused by pathogens already present in the environment, brought out of obscurity or given a selective advantage by changing conditions and afforded an opportunity to infect new host populations. Also on rare occasions, a new variant may evolve and cause a new disease. Altered virus transmission because of deforestation and environment change, ecological changes and agricultural development, commerce, technology, microbial adaptation and change, breakdown of public health measures, and deficiencies in public health infrastructure are the reasons for emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases in general and viral infections in particular. Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. Moreover, these factors are increasing in prevalence. This increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasize the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. These viruses are rich source of emerging diseases due to the introduction of infections from other species in the zoonotic pool. In the near future, there is an urgent need to monitor collaboration between humanCanimal interface so that public health risks can be understood. A number of activities increase microbial traffic from animals to humans or disseminate microbes from isolated groups into new populations and as a result promote emergence and epidemics. In some cases, including many of the most novel infections, the agents are zoonotic crossing from their natural hosts into the human population because of many similarities.

Little is known about COVID-19 prevalence and incidence in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. Aim To evaluate the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing CR in ambulatory setting. Methods From august to October 2020, all patients admitted in a single ambulatory CR program were screened for COVID-19 infection before and after CR, through naso-pharyngeal RT-PCR and serology assays before and after the CR. Number of patients was reduced from 9 to 4 in each group, 2 meters distancing respected, and all patients and staff had to wear surgical mask during sessions. Hand washing and material disinfection were systematic before and after each session for both patients and health professionals. Results Among the 81 patients included, 63 (76%) were male, mean age was 5711 years (Table 1). None (0%) had positive RT-PCR before entering CR and only 2 (2.7%) were tested positive after CR. These two patients were asymptomatic. After serological analysis, 3 patients (3.8%) had anti-bodies against SARS-COV-2 before and after participating CR (Fig. 1). These 3 patients were negative on nasal swab before and after CR. No seroconversion was observed. In total (before and after CR), 5 patients (6.0%) were tested positive with COVID-19. Those 5 patients were younger (mean age 51 years old versus 58, P =0.02), with better functional capacity before and after CR: respectively 7.1 METs (versus 5.2 METs, P =0.01) and 8.3 METs (versus 6.3 METs, P =0.03). In COVID+ patients, improvement of functional capacity was similar to COVIDCpatients: respectively 0.8 METs (P =0.9) and 15 Watts (P =0.9). Conclusion CR is not associated with risk of infection with SARS-COV-2, provided that basic sanitary measures are stricly applied.

Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous. The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic. METHODS The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS A \\"clean\\" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future. In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region. These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.","output":"Radiotherapy in Southern Italy at the time of COVID-19: options for radiation oncology units."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stark words like \\"code blue,\\" \\"pediatric,\\" and \\"charge the defibrillator panels\\" rushed around me as doctors and nurses crowded the emergency department, primed for the next time I might slip into cardiac arrest Small, spherical droplets of water beaded on my forehead as I stood solitary on the darkened platform, looking on as public health officials and police pulled a passenger suspected of having coronavirus from our car DISEASE CONTROL AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY In the age of COVID-19, words like \\"community,\\" \\"health disparities,\\" and \\"global burden of infectious disease\\" have become universal and portents for communal experience","output":"Future Infectious Disease Outbreaks and Collective Responsibility: Students' Experiences and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community health workers (CHWs) have the capacity to bring essential health services to underresourced communities.

Here, we performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of South Korean bat viruses. Genetic comparative analysis was performed on the spike glycoprotein gene of the detected MERS-related CoVs. Among 1640 samples (348 oral swabs, 1199 faecal samples, 83 urine samples and 10 bat carcass) collected across 24 South Korean provinces during 2017-2019, CoV was detected in 82 samples (75 faeces and seven oral swab samples) from 11 provinces. Surveillance over the 3 years during which samples were collected revealed significantly higher CoV detection rates between spring and autumn, and a high detection rate in Vespertillionidae and Rhinolophidae bats. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Korean bat CoVs are genetically diverse regardless of their spatiotemporal distribution and their host species, and that the discovered bat CoVs belong to various subgenera within the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera. Twenty detected MERS-related CoVs belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus were similar to the Ia io bat CoV NL140422 and NL13845 strains. A comprehensive genetic analysis of two Korean bat MERS-related CoV spike receptor binding domain (RBDs) (176 and 267 strains) showed that the 18 critical residues that are involved in interactions with the human DPP4 receptor are most similar to the NL13845 strain, which is known to not bind with hDPP4. A deeper analysis of the interfacing residues in the Korean bat MERS-related CoVs RBD-hDPP4 complexes showed that the Korean bat CoVs has fewer polar contacts than the NL13845 strain. Although further study will be needed, these results suggest that Korean bat MERS-related CoVs are unlikely to bind with hDPP4.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization suggested the term, physical distancing, as opposed to social distancing, arguing that it is a physical distance which prevents transmission; people can remain socially connected via technology. This paper discusses the concepts of social distance, social distancing, physical distancing, self-quarantine, self-isolation, symptomatic, asymptomatic and parasymptomatic cases as they relate to COVID-19 and African perception of pandemic diseases. Although the idea of social distancing is not novel to the Africans, but a challenge in its implementation is that historically, social distancing is rather applied to non-infectious cases like mental illness, epilepsy, infertility, aging, victims of sexual violence and the like. The paper utilizes health-related theories and pertinent empirical findings to explain African perspective of social distancing and the challenges of adoption in pandemic situations. The theories on health risk perception reviewed include the protection motivation theory, the health belief model, the extended parallel process model and the precaution adoption process model. From consumer psychology background on product adoption, a conceptual model for social distancing adoption in pandemics was advanced. These ancient and novel health-related theories and models were applied to explain the erroneous understanding, perception and adoption challenges of social distancing in Africa, leading to possible increase in the spread of the coronavirus.","output":"African Perspective of Social Distancing in Pandemics: Adoption Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aim to address issues ranging from poverty and economic growth to climate change.

Recent studies on ACE-I and ARB in COVID-19 were limited by excluding outpatients, excluding patients by age, analyzing ACE-I and ARB together, imputing missing data, and/or diagnosing COVID-19 by chest computed tomography without definitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), all of which are addressed here. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1023 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by RT-PCR at Stanford Hospital through April 8, 2020 with a minimum follow-up time of 14 days to investigate the association between ACE-I or ARB use with outcomes. RESULTS: Use of ACE-I or ARB medications was not associated with increased risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death. Compared to patients with charted past medical history, there was a lower risk of hospitalization for patients on ACE-I (odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19C0.97; P = 0.0426) and ARB (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.17C0.90; P = 0.0270).

This study aims to explore students' perceptions of learning during four exceptional semesters. Design/methodology/approach: Five surveys were conducted via the program LimeSurvey during the online courses at one business school in Switzerland: April 2020, June 2020, December 2020, June 2021 and December 2021. The participation varied between 56% (April and June 2020), 52% (December 2020), 47.5% (June 2021) and 42.4% (December 2021). Findings: The results of this longitudinal study were analyzed to examine the consequences of forced online learning. The analysis reveals that although the students appreciate the usefulness of the learning experience, their motivation decreased. The historic crisis has underlined sudden technological changes in the learning programs that have had multiple (adverse) effects on students' learning. Originality/value: Based on the results, this study concludes that students have mixed perceptions regarding the learning environments (traditional, hybrid or blended) moving forward. Whatever the choice, HEIs must carefully plan the most effective teaching/learning environment to ensure that students remain engaged.

He suffered from recurrent bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, which were successfully treated with bilateral thoracoscopy and resections of the destroyed lung areas. Notably, he has already been under treatment with anticoagulation due to portal thrombosis 8 years ago. DISCUSSION: Although especially know from patients under mechanical ventilation, this patient suffered from spontaneous pneumothorax without ever been ventilated. Probably due to the severe vascular inflammatory changes and focal endothelitis like also seen in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the pneumothorax may lead to a prolonged air leak, which needs surgical therapy.

A value framework was constructed via document reviews and stakeholder consultations. Probability of Success (PoS) data was obtained for 16 platform projects through expert assessments and stakeholder portfolio preferences via a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). The structure of preferences and the uncertainties in project PoS suggested a non-linear, stochastic value maximization problem. A simulation-optimization algorithm was employed, identifying optimal portfolios under different budget constraints. Stochastic dominance of the optimization solution was tested via mean-variance and mean-Gini statistics, and its robustness via rank probability analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation. Project PoS estimates were low and substantially overlapping. The DCE identified decreasing rates of return to investing in single platform types. Optimal portfolio solutions reflected this non-linearity of platform preferences along an efficiency frontier and diverged from a model simply ranking projects by PoS-to-Cost, despite significant revisions to project PoS estimates during the review process in relation to the conduct of the DCE. Large confidence intervals associated with optimization solutions suggested significant uncertainty in portfolio valuations. Mean-variance and Mean-Gini tests suggested optimal portfolios with higher expected values were also accompanied by higher risks of not achieving those values despite stochastic dominance of the optimal portfolio solution under the decision makers budget constraint. This portfolio was also the highest ranked portfolio in the simulation; though having only a 54% probability of being preferred to the second-ranked portfolio. The analysis illustrates how optimization modelling can help health R&D decision makers identify optimal portfolios in the face of significant decision uncertainty involving portfolio trade-offs. However, in light of such extreme uncertainty, further due diligence and ongoing updating of performance is needed on highly risky projects as well as data on decision makers portfolio risk attitude before PDA can conclude about optimal and robust solutions.","output":"Prioritizing investments in rapid response vaccine technologies for emerging infections: A portfolio decision analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) screening policy change on the incidence of healthcare-associated (HA)-VRE bacteremia in an endemic hospital setting.

METHODS Since May 2010, our hospital has diminished VRE screening for admitted patients transferred from other healthcare facilities. We assessed the impact of this policy change on the incidence of HA-VRE bacteremia using segmented autoregression analysis of interrupted time series from January 2006 to December 2014 at the hospital and unit levels. In addition, we compared the molecular characteristics of VRE blood isolates collected before and after the screening policy change using multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS After the VRE screening policy change, the incidence of hospital-wide HA-VRE bacteremia increased, although no significant changes of level or slope were observed.

Influenza A virus infection evolves into a severe respiratory failure in some young adult patients, related to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Mortality rates remain high despite antiviral treatment and aggressive respiratory support. The influenza A virus (IAV) infection will induce a proinflammatory innate immune response through recognition of viral RNA by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) molecules by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B route). Anti-inflammatory therapies focused on modulating this inflammatory response to all patients have not been satisfactory. Steroids should be avoided because they do not improve survival and promote superinfections. Since clinical judgment has often been proven inadequate, interest in the use of biomarkers to monitor host response and to assess severity and complications is growing. It is well known that, if used appropriately, these can be helpful tools to predict not only severity but also mortality. We need more biomarkers that predict host response: it is time to change lactate measurement to proteomics and transcriptomics.

Using multi-omic approaches, we provide a comprehensive view of the connections between the microbiome and host gene expression in distinct stages of gastric carcinogenesis (i.e., healthy, gastritis, cancer). Our integrative analysis uncovers various associations specific to disease states. For example, uniquely in gastritis, Helicobacteraceae is highly correlated with the expression of FAM3D, which has been previously implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation. In addition, in gastric cancer but not in adjacent gastritis, Lachnospiraceae is highly correlated with the expression of UBD, which regulates mitosis and cell cycle time. Furthermore, lower abundances of B cell signatures in gastric cancer compared to gastritis may suggest a previously unidentified immune evasion process in gastric carcinogenesis.

This review synthesizes the available data and provides a framework for optimal management of stroke patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection and eligible to reperfusion treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Reorganization of health services has led to the conversion of stroke units and relocation of stroke staff to COVID units. During the pandemic surge, there has been a general decline of stroke presentations, increased time delays, and reduced activity across all areas of stroke care, specifically the delivery of acute treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 patients seem to have a worse outcome despite prompt recanalization. Periprocedural monitoring studies are needed in these patients to target a more adequate therapy. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized the ability of stroke centers to provide timely assessment and acute therapies such as reperfusive treatments. Yet, as stroke remains a medical emergency, efforts to maintain stroke teams and safe provision of highly effective stroke treatments should be prioritized despite healthcare systems reorganization. This can be accomplished through the activation of telestroke networks, protected stroke pathways, 24/7 open-access high-quality stroke centers, and stroke awareness programs.","output":"Acute stroke treatment during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to identify and synthesize qualitative studies of frontline nurses' experiences and challenges when caring for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals. BACKGROUND: This review is the first qualitative systematic review of nurses' experiences since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding nurses' experiences with COVID-19 is important because nurses are among the most vital of healthcare workers. METHODS: This study used a qualitative systematic review methodology with thematic synthesis to analyse the included studies. Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched from January to mid-August 2020, and 25 abstracts were screened. Based on inclusion criteria, this qualitative systematic review included nine studies. RESULTS: Five themes were identified as barriers to COVID-19 care by 133 hospital-based nurses: limited information about COVID-19, unpredictable tasks and challenging practices, insufficient support, concerns about family, and emotional and psychological stress. CONCLUSIONS: The five barriers identified in this review should be overcome to improve nurses' experiences and, in turn, the quality of care patients with COVID-19 receive. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The findings from this review can be used to reform current healthcare and hospital-support systems for populations with COVID-19. They can also be used to point towards areas of research interested in improving frontline nursing. Finally, nursing leaders, healthcare policymakers and governments should use these findings to better support the nursing workforce in the current or a future pandemic.","output":"Nurses' barriers to caring for patients with COVID-19: a qualitative systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A critical step for decreasing zoonotic disease threats is to have a good understanding of the associated risks. Hunters frequently handle potentially infected birds, so they are more at risk of being exposed to zoonotic avian pathogens, including avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The objective of the current study was to gain a better understanding of Cuban hunters' general hunting practices, focusing on their knowledge and risk perception on avian influenza. An anonymous and voluntary semi-structured questionnaire was designed and applied to 398 hunters. Multiple correspondence analyses found relationships with potential exposure of AIVs to people and domestic animals. The main associated risks factors identified were not taking the annual flu vaccine (60.1%) and not cleaning hunting knives (26.3%); Direct contact with water (32.1%), cleaning wild birds at home (33.2%); receiving assistance during bird cleaning (41.9%), keeping poultry at home (56.5%) and feeding domestic animals with wild bird leftovers (30.3%) were also identified as significant risk factors. The lack of use of some protective measures reported by hunters had no relationship with their awareness on avian influenza, which may imply a lack of such knowledge. The results evidenced that more effective risk communication strategies about the consequences of AIVs infecting human or other animals, and the importance of reducing such risks, are urgently needed.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Risk Perception Toward Avian Influenza Virus Exposure Among Cuban Hunters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aeromonas hydrophila RIT668 and Citrobacter freundii RIT669 were isolated from endangered spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata).

The number and the findings of FDG-PET/CT studies acquired in the corresponding period of 2019 were also assessed for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of FDG-PET/CT studies performed during the pandemic (n = 299) and in the corresponding period of 2019 (n = 335) were comparable. The percentage of abnormal FDG-PET/CT findings, suspicious for interstitial pneumonia by Covid-19 infection, was significantly higher during the pandemic (9%) compared with that found in the corresponding period of 2019 (4%) ((2) 5.45, P = 0.02).

The regression coefficients were examined separately for periods in countries that were following three different testing policies. RESULTS: Corrected for the other factors, negative test numbers when tested on demand and tested if symptomatic only are associated with an increase in hospitalizations 14 days after the tests. When only the symptomatic and more vulnerable are tested, negative tests are associated with fewer hospitalizations 2 weeks out. CONCLUSIONS: A policy of testing only vulnerable populations, whether symptomatic or not, appears to avoid spreading the virus as a result of testing policy.

The rapid increase in unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment to estimate the causal relationship between unemployment and prescription drug use at the aggregate level. In total, the growth in unemployment during the pandemic resulted in a 2.6% reduction in medication adherence and 57.5 million fewer prescriptions filled in 2020, with prescriptions declining for many chronic conditions. Unemployment-related reductions in prescription fills and medication adherence were highest in states without expanded Medicaid eligibility, further underscoring the importance of social safety nets such as Medicaid during times of economic hardship.","output":"The Impact of Job and Insurance Loss on Prescription Drug use: A Panel Data Approach to Quantifying the Health Consequences of Unemployment During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new type and rapidly spread viral pneumonia, is now producing an outbreak of pandemic proportions.

We assessed CureCancers feasibility and patients and HCPs satisfaction. Methods: Patients from 9 Centers were asked to register at CureCancer, upload their data and complete a questionnaire on demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and their satisfaction. Results: : 159 patients were enrolled and 144 (90.6%) registered. 114 of 144 (79.1%), 63 males and 51 females, median age 54.5 years, completed the questionnaire. 64 patients were University and 35 were high School graduates. 46 patients had metastatic disease, 87 were on active treatment and 51 received supportive care. All patients also visited non-oncology HCPs. Nineteen patients changed work status and 49 had children below 24 years. Registration was very/very much easy for 98 (86.0 %) patients.

Based on both quantitative and qualitative data collected in China's Hubei province (i.e. the first epicentre of COVID-19), this research explores how the pandemic influences the practices of e-health from the perspective of users. Through analysis of 1,033 surveys and 14 in-depth interviews, we find that e-health has played a crucial role in residents' healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain external factors influence the choice of digital health, including the high risk of infection outdoors, the shutting down of transport systems, and dysfunctional healthcare facilities that neglect non-COVID-19 patients' clinical demands. Against this backdrop, we argue digital health acts as a functional equivalent to traditional medical treatment and has largely satisfied patients and users in the crisis period. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has unintentionally sped up the diffusion of digital medicine over the long term as respondents expressed their willingness to continue use of e-health in the post-COVID-19 phase. However, we assert that despite the increasing use of e-health, it cannot fully substitute traditional offline treatment. Thus, we suggest a combination of online and offline healthcare will be more commonly practiced in the future.","output":"The use of E-health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study in China's Hubei province."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distributed multi-agent learning enables agents to cooperatively train a model without requiring to share their datasets.

The widespread use of mobile phones, including in rural areas, constitutes a potentially effective tool for real-time surveillance of infectious diseases. Using longitudinal data from a disease surveillance system implemented in 1500 households in rural Kenya, we test the effectiveness of mobile phone animal syndromic surveillance by comparing it with routine household animal health surveys, determine the individual and household correlates of its use and examine the broader implications for surveillance of zoonotic diseases. A total of 20 340 animal and death events were reported from the community through the two surveillance systems, half of which were confirmed as valid disease events. The probability of an event being valid was 2.1 times greater for the phone-based system, compared with the household visits. Illness events were 15 times (95% CI 12.8, 17.1) more likely to be reported through the phone system compared to routine household visits, but not death events (OR 0.1 (95% CI 0.09, 0.11)). Disease syndromes with severe presentations were more likely to be reported through the phone system. While controlling for herd and flock sizes owned, phone ownership was not a determinant of using the phone-based surveillance system, but the lack of a formal education, and having additional sources of income besides farming were associated with decreased likelihood of reporting through the phone system. Our study suggests that a phone-based surveillance system will be effective at detecting outbreaks of diseases such as Rift Valley fever that present with severe clinical signs in animal populations, but in the absence of additional reporting incentives, it may miss early outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza that present primarily with mortality.

Some studies suggest a higher risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in this specific population. DESIGN: Cohort exposed/nonexposed study among the REA-REZO surveillance network. SETTING: Multicentric; ICUs in France. PATIENTS: The coronavirus disease 2019 patients at admission were matched on the age, sex, center of inclusion, presence of antimicrobial therapy at admission, patient provenance, time from ICU admission to mechanical ventilation, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at admission to the patients included between 2016 and 2019 within the same surveillance network (1:1). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the cumulative incidence, and hazard rate of the first and the second ventilator-associated pneumonia were estimated. In addition, the ventilator-associated pneumonia microbiological ecology and specific resistant pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 exposed and nonexposed patients were compared. Medication data were not collected. A total of 1,879 patients were included in each group. The overall incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was higher among coronavirus disease 2019 exposed patients (25.5; 95% CI [23.7C27.45] vs 15.4; 95% CI [13.7C17.3] ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000 ventilation days). The cumulative incidence was higher for the first and the second ventilator-associated pneumonia among the coronavirus disease 2019 exposed patients (respective Gray test p < 0.0001 and 0.0167). The microbiological ecology and resistance were comparable between groups with a predominance of Enterobacterales and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacteria.

The sample consisted of 60 LTC direct care employees, all employed at the same organization, who completed an on-line survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of demographic questions and the Fraboni Scale of Ageism. Twenty-one of these employees participated in a 30-45 minute phone interview. Cultural artifacts were also collected. All data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although quantitative results showed no statistical significance, qualitative results suggest that employees do exhibit some ageist attitudes towards the residents for whom they care. Despite evidence that most employees felt a deep connection with residents, they detached themselves from the aging process. The theoretical framework lends hand in explaining how both ableism and ageism appeared to contribute to this detachment. Findings indicated employees interactions and attitudes towards residents were influenced by themes compassionate ageism, ableism, and identity, which resulted in meta theme caregiver validation and reward. Employees received validation and altruistic reward from positive interactions with what they perceived to be ideal residents; those who fit the stereotype of a nursing home resident, such as older, pleasant, and dependent.

A decomposition scoring method and a Book of Reference (visual resource) were made. Ninety-one cases were used to develop a method to estimate the PMI. The photographs were scored using the decomposition scoring method. The temperature data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. The PMI was estimated using the total decomposition score (TDS) and using the TDS and ADD. The latter required an additional step, namely to calculate the ADD from the finding date back until the predicted day of death. The developed decomposition scoring method had a high interrater reliability. The TDS significantly estimates the PMI (R (2) = 0.67 and 0.80 for indoor and outdoor bodies, respectively).

Recently, darobactin A, a novel bicyclic heptapeptide that selectively kills Gram-negative bacteria by targeting the outer membrane protein BamA, was discovered. Its efficacy was proven in animal infection models of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thus promoting darobactin A as a promising lead compound. Originally discovered from members of the nematode-symbiotic genus Photorhabdus, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding the synthesis of darobactin A can also be found in other members of the class Gammaproteobacteria. Therein, the precursor peptides DarB to -F, which differ in their core sequence from darobactin A, were identified in silico. Even though production of these analogs was not observed in the putative producer strains, we were able to generate them by mutasynthetic derivatization of a heterologous expression system. The analogs generated were isolated and tested for their bioactivity. The most potent compound, darobactin B, was used for cocrystallization with the target BamA, revealing a binding site identical to that of darobactin A. Despite its potency, darobactin B did not exhibit cytotoxicity, and it was slightly more active against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates than darobactin A. Furthermore, we evaluated the plasma protein binding of darobactin A and B, indicating their different pharmacokinetic properties. This is the first report on new members of this new antibiotic class, which is likely to expand to several promising therapeutic candidates. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic options to combat Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are dwindling with increasing antibiotic resistance. This study presents a proof of concept for the heterologous-expression approach to expand on the novel antibiotic class of darobactins and to generate analogs with different activities and pharmacokinetic properties.

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-its high basic reproduction number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread-exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.","output":"Individually optimal choices can be collectively disastrous in COVID-19 disease control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interactions of a metal complex [Ru(phen)(2)PMIP](2+) {Ru=ruthenium, phen=1,10-phenanthroline, PMIP=2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline} with yeast tRNA and calf thymus DNA (CT DNA) have been investigated comparatively by UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, viscosity measurements, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), as well as equilibrium dialysis and circular dichroism (CD). Spectroscopic studies together with ITC and viscosity measurements indicate that both binding modes of the Ru(II) polypyridyl complex to yeast tRNA and CT DNA are intercalation and yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT DNA binding. ITC experiments show that the interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA is driven by a moderately favorable enthalpy decrease in combination with a moderately favorable entropy increase, while the binding of the complex to CT DNA is driven by a large favorable enthalpy decrease with a less favorable entropy increase. The results from equilibrium dialysis and CD suggest that both interactions are enantioselective and the  enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT DNA than the  enantiomer does, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT DNA.

However, the effect of the street network on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence has been insufficiently studied. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19, is far more transmissible than previous respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which highlights the role of the spatial configuration of street network in COVID-19 spread, as it is where humans have contact with each other, especially in high-density areas. To fill this research gap, this study utilized space syntax theory and investigated the effect of the urban BE on the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. METHOD: This study collected a comprehensive dataset including a total of 3815 confirmed cases and corresponding locations from January 18 to October 5, 2020. Based on the space syntax theory, six space syntax measures were selected as quantitative indicators for the urban BE. A linear regression model and Geographically Weighted Regression model were then applied to explore the underlying relationships between COVID-19 cases and the urban BE. In addition, we have further improved the performance of GWR model considering the spatial heterogeneity and scale effects by adopting an adaptive bandwidth. RESULT: Our results indicated a strong correlation between the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and the urban BE. Areas with higher integration (a measure of the cognitive complexity required for a pedestrians to reach a street) and betweenness centrality values (a measure of spatial network accessibility) tend to have more confirmed cases. Further, the Geographically Weighted Regression model with adaptive bandwidth achieved the best performance in predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: In this study, we revealed a strong positive relationship between the spatial configuration of street network and the spread of COVID-19 cases. The topology, network accessibility, and centrality of an urban area were proven to be effective for use in predicting the spread of COVID-19.

In a time of crisis, continued access to and delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (M-OUD) is essential to save lives. However, prior to COVID-19, large variability in M-OUD adoption existed across the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) and it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this divide. For the past two years, our team worked with eight VHA facilities to enhance adoption of M-OUD through a multi-component implementation intervention. This commentary explores these providers' responses to COVID-19 and the subsequent impact on their progress toward increasing adoption of M-OUD. Briefly, the loosening of regulatory restrictions fostered accelerated adoption of M-OUD, rapid support for telehealth offered a mechanism to increase M-OUD access, and reevaluation of current practices surrounding M-OUD strengthened adoption. Overall, during the COVID-19 crisis, facilities and providers responded positively to the call for increased access to M-OUD and appropriate care of patients with OUD. The VHA providers' responses and continued progress in enhancing M-OUD amidst a crisis may, in part, be attributable to their participation in an implementation effort prior to COVID-19 that established resources, expert support, and a community of practice.

Early detection of COVID-19 may protect many infected people. Unfortunately, COVID-19 can be mistakenly diagnosed as pneumonia or lung cancer, which with fast spread in the chest cells, can lead to patient death. The most commonly used diagnosis methods for these three diseases are chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, a multi-classification deep learning model for diagnosing COVID-19, pneumonia, and lung cancer from a combination of chest x-ray and CT images is proposed. This combination has been used because chest X-ray is less powerful in the early stages of the disease, while a CT scan of the chest is useful even before symptoms appear, and CT can precisely detect the abnormal features that are identified in images. In addition, using these two types of images will increase the dataset size, which will increase the classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no other deep learning model choosing between these diseases is found in the literature.

Global efforts are underway to circumvent its further spread and treat COVID-19 patients through experimental vaccine formulations and therapeutic interventions, respectively. In the absence of any effective therapeutics, we have devised h bioinformatics-based approaches to accelerate global efforts in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 and to assist researchers in the initial phase of vaccine and therapeutics development. In this study, we have performed comprehensive meta-analyses and developed an integrative resource, CoronaVR (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/coronavr/).

Through network pharmacology screening, GPPGPA was found to have good drug-like properties, and 103 targets of GPPGPA overlap with T2DM targets. These targets were mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway associated with T2DM, the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, the TNF signaling pathway, insulin resistance and so on. The core targets were identified as AKT1, MAPK8, MAPK10 and JUN by constructing a \\"peptide-target-pathway\\" network. The molecular docking results showed that GPPGPA was well bound to the core targets. These results suggested that GPPGPA had the potential to reduce T2DM. Further in vitro experiments showed that GPPGPA as a competitive inhibitor could effectively inhibit the activity of -glucosidase. The results of the IR-HepG2 cell model experiments showed that GPPGPA was not toxic to HepG2 cells, and could reduce IR of HepG2 cells induced by high-glucose and high-insulin, improve glucose consumption, increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduce the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). The above results suggested that GPPGPA could improve T2DM by reducing insulin resistance through a multi-target and multi-pathway mechanism.

E-learning not only enhances learning quality, but it has also become the only medium of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people have been forced to stay at home. Due to the pandemic, most countries have initiated online learning to continue the learning process, thus lessening the study gap. Against this backdrop, it is imperative to explore the perception and satisfaction level of e-learners regarding e-learning tools. In this study, a quantitative approach was conducted on the students of two leading public universities (graduates and postgraduates) to identify the impact of the determinants of the SERVQUAL model (reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and website design), as well as learning content, on overall perceived quality and satisfaction. In total, 895 respondents participated in the study, and data were analyzed with Amos 23 to confirm the hypotheses, utilizing structural equation modeling.

While multilateral institutions are beginning to consider how to distribute them, former U.S. President Trump and others have suggested suing China for damages. This \\"lawsuit approach\\" draws on a deep-seated conception of international law: States have a sovereign \\"right to be left alone\\";the only limit to this right is a correlative duty to avoid harming others. Those harmed can, then, sue for damages. In this view, who should pay for the costs of the pandemic (and how much) is not a normative question about justice, but rather one about factual causes and actuarial calculations. In this Article, we explore this lawsuit approach-not for its legal viability, but for its conceptual implications. We exhaustively and critically assess the doctrinal discussion on China's international liability for the pandemic while also pointing at deep theoretical implications that this novel crisis has for international law more broadly. Specifically, we make three novel claims. The first is that the arguments made using the lawsuit approach (based on the International Health Regulations and the no-harm principle), when meticulously analyzed under existing international norms, run into unexpected obstacles. On top of the jurisdictional and evidentiary hurdles noted by many, we argue that the lawsuit approach faces difficulties stemming from the lack of deep normative agreement in international law on how to deal with unprecedented challenges such as COVID-19. Our second claim draws on the first. Given the need to fill these normative voids, the lawsuit approach leads back to the global conversation about the allocation of losses that it carefully tries to avoid. This normative dependence cannot be spared by analogy with domestic law. Domestic law builds upon thick cultural understandings that fill empty legal concepts (such as \\"harm\\" or \\"causation\\"), making them readily operative. International law, however, lacks an equivalent thick culture to fill these voids and therefore requires complex reconstructions of what states owe to one another. Our third claim further extends the foregoing reasoning. The lawsuit approach relies on international law as a means to achieve corrective justice while denying its implications for distributive justice. We argue that this is conceptually impossible. Allocating responsibility for the pandemic implicates inherently distributive concepts: To decide, an adjudicator would need to rely on a pretorian rule detailing how much effort and expense countries should dedicate to avoiding harm to other countries. That rule is conceptually distributive, independent of its content. The misfortunes derived from the pandemic are not conceptually different from the mis- fortunes of poverty, financial breakdowns, or climate change. Those going down the road of the lawsuit approach might be unpleasantly surprised by where that road leads them.","output":"Who Should Pay for COVID-19?

COVID-19 is already implicated in causing discrete para-infectious neurological syndromes: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS), and is also associated with encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disease, neuromuscular disorders, and seizures. Case Presentation We describe a case of a 43-year-old Asian woman with chronic Hepatitis B (HBV) co-infected acutely with COVID-19, presenting with urinary retention, bilateral blindness, thoracic sensory level, and quadriparesis. Extensive workup narrowed down her diagnosis as seronegative NMOSD. She had complete resolution of symptoms after treatment with concurrent plasma exchange (PLEX), high dose corticosteroids, and emtricitabine-tenofovir. Follow-up visit showed no seroconversion at 6 months and no relapses. Conclusions Our literature review highlights the likely link between COVID-19 infection and the development of neurologic autoimmune diseases. Our literature review supports a virus-triggered immune-mediated process rather than neuro-invasion. Many viral illnesses have been linked to the development of NMOSD and anti-AQP4 antibody-related myelitis. Additionally, there is limited literature linking chronic HBV infection with the development of optic neuritis and speculation thatcross-reactivity between HBsAg and myelin antigens may lead to the development of demyelinating diseases in the CNS and PNS.

For example, patients experiencing central vision loss due to disease (macular degeneration) or healthy participants trained with simulated central vision loss, tend to develop eccentric fixation spots for reading or other visual tasks. In both patients and in simulated conditions, there are substantial individual variations in the effective use of the periphery. The factors driving these individual differences are still unclear. Although early approaches have described some dimensions of these strategies, the field is still in its initial stages and important elements are often conflated when examining gaze patterns. Here, we propose a systematic approach to characterize oculomotor strategies in cases of central vision loss that distinguishes different components: saccadic re-referencing, saccadic precision, first saccade landing dispersion, fixation stability, latency of target acquisition, and percentage of trials that are useful. We tested this approach in healthy individuals trained with a gaze-contingent display obstructing the central 10 degrees of the visual field. The use of simulated scotoma helps overcome known challenges in clinical research, from recruitment and compliance to the diverse extent and nature of the visual loss. Importantly, this approach offers the ability to examine oculomotor strategies as they develop in controlled settings where viewing conditions are similar across participants. Results show substantial differences in characteristics of peripheral looking strategies, both across trials and individuals. This more complete characterization of peripheral looking strategies can help us understand individual differences in rehabilitation after central vision loss.","output":"A method to characterize compensatory oculomotor strategies following simulated central vision loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinicians in the frontline need to assess quickly whether a patient with symptoms indeed has COVID-19 or not. The difficulty of this task is exacerbated in low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests. Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low- and middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray images, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent classification using machine learning methods that do not require large computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14 individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50 for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively. The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential benefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in resource-limited settings and it can run with limited computational resources.","output":"An Efficient Mixture of Deep and Machine Learning Models for COVID-19 and Tuberculosis Detection Using X-Ray Images in Resource Limited Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CDC and the World Health Qrganization (WHO) are continuing to investigate the multicountry outbreak of unexplained atypical pneumonia referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Body weight, glycolipid metabolic parameters, and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were assessed in the experimental process. The effects of ITF on the fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: Pregnant HFD-fed mice displayed significant insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. ITF (3.33 g/kg/day) treatment improved glucose and lipid metabolism disorder parameters in HFD-induced GDM mice and alleviated fat accumulation and glucose intolerance. The alpha diversity of the gut microbial community was increased in ITF mice, while the beta diversity returned to the level of normal chow diet (NCD) mice. Interestingly, Verrucomicrobia, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia were obviously enriched, while Dubosiella was obviously lessened after inulin treatment.

However, in pregnant women, HEV infection can be severe and has been associated with up to 30% mortality in the third trimester. Additionally, HEV infection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of preterm labor and vertical transmission. MAIN BODY: HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries. HEV can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, zoonotic route, and blood transfusion route. An altered immune status, hormonal levels, and viral factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Currently, no established treatment is available for HEV in pregnant women. A Chinese vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective against HEV in the general population and seems to be safe in pregnancy; however, its safety and efficacy in a large population of pregnant women remain to be determined. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the current knowledge about HEV infection during pregnancy and focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, mechanisms underlying severe liver injury, and management and prevention of HEV infection during pregnancy. Considering that HEV infection during pregnancy may result in poor outcomes, screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should be taken into account.

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN-? and monocyte TFN- production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%C50% of the IFN-? and TNF- observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity.

The key objective of the exercise was to foster sustainability awareness with regard to the effectiveness of tree-planting initiatives to offset carbon emissions. Collaborative learning is a process by which students work together in small groups to accomplish a common goal. As experiences are active, social and student-owned, the process leads to the development of a variety of cognitive and transferable skills that are beneficial in academia and the workplace. Through data collection/analysis, the carbon biomass exercise not only allowed students to assess critically the efficacy of a tree-planting initiative as a means to sequester carbon, but they became aware of the difficulties in performing research on complex environmental issues. The intention of the research was to give students an opportunity to practice data collection, data analysis, problem solving, teamwork, communication and scientific literacy skills, meanwhile utilizing the campus open green space to enhance the knowledge discovery process. Informal assessment and discussions with students demonstrated that the activity was successful in reaching a wide range of students with varying backgrounds and initial attitudes about climate change mitigating strategies, which was our objective. Our case study demonstrates how learning objectives can be integrated with university sustainability initiatives to improve learning and student engagement. Finally, we see green spaces as dynamic settings for learning about physical processes and issues related to environmental management and sustainability.","output":"Promoting sustainability education through hands-on approaches: a tree carbon sequestration exercise in a Singapore green space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reclassification of chronic pain as a disease may be helpful because patients with chronic pain require significant treatment and rehabilitation with a clear diagnosis.

During the past decade of the opioid epidemic, methadone was the primary treatment for opioid addiction until buprenorphine was approved. Buprenorphine's high-affinity partial agonist properties make it a good alternative to methadone due to lower abuse potential and safer adverse effect profile while maintaining significant efficacy. Expanded out-patient prescribing options have allowed physician and physician extenders such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners to treat these patients that otherwise would have been required to utilize methadone.

In Cuba, all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hospitalized from this point forward. OBJECTIVE: Characterize the first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba. INTRODUCTION: METHODS We carried out a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 415 suspected cases of COVID-19 admitted to the Pedro Kour Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana, Cuba, from March 11, 2020 through April 10, 2020. (In Cuba, all patients suspected of being COVID-19-positive were admitted to hospitals or isolation centers for observation and treatment.) Of these 415 individuals, 63 (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Information was obtained from the Institute's databases as well as a standardized interview form for cases confirmed or suspected as infected with the novel coronavirus. We considered the following variables: age, sex, occupation at the time of interview, national origin, personal health history, time elapsed between symptom onset and hospital admission, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and status at discharge. We based our analysis on frequency distributions and double-entry contingency tables. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 years (range: 16-94 years). The 45-54 age group represented the largest share of cases (25.4%; 16/63); persons aged &#8805;65 years were 20.6% (13/63); there were more men than women (55.6% vs. 44.4%). Cubans represented 52.4% (33/63) of patients while 47.6% (30/63) were from 14 countries where COVID-19 had already been identified. All foreigners and Cubans who arrived from abroad were considered imported cases (54.0%; 34/63). Health personnel (10 doctors and 1 nurse) represented 17.5% (11/63) of cases. Cough (50.8%), fever (46.0%), sore throat (22.2%) and headache (19.0%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Asymptomatic patients represented 25.4% (16/63) of cases. Hypertension was the most frequently associated chronic disease (28.6%), followed by asthma (25.0%) and diabetes (17.9%). Patients who were admitted to hospital &#8805;3 days after symptom onset represented 66.7% (42/63) of cases. Mean hospital stay was 13.7 days (range: 1-27 days). Factors associated with a higher risk of contracting the disease included occupation as a healthcare worker (OR: 1.85; 95%, CI: 0.88-3.87) and aged &#8805;65 years (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 0.85-3.34). Five individuals died, for a fatality rate of 7.9% (three foreigners and two Cubans; four men and one woman). Four of these patients were infected outside of Cuba and one was identified as a contact of a confirmed case. All patients who died had significant comorbidities (diabetes, asthma and hypertension). Age of deceased patients ranged from 54 to 87 years. CONCLUSION: The first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba were admitted to the Pedro Kour Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana. They share characteristics with those reported by other countries: more men than women were affected, and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and asthma were all important risk factors, as was age &#8805;65 years. More than half of all cases were imported, and autochthonous patients were all contacts of confirmed cases.","output":"Clinical-Epidemiological Characteristics of the First Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Turkey, an increase of scabies cases was detected since the last quarter of 2019. During the same period, Turkey was also under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the whole world.

METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out in July 2020 and the records of patients diagnosed with scabies in health institutions in K?rklareli Province between Jan 2017-June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Average number of cases before Sep 2019, when cases began to exceed the expected value, was calculated as 31.712.0 and after Sep 2019 it was calculated as 129.853.6 (P<0.001, CI 95%). The number of scabies cases which increased before the pandemic and reached the epidemic level, decreased dramatically in Mar and Apr 2020. This period was also the period in which the measures taken for the COVID-19 pandemic were most strictly applied. In May and June, the epidemic continued from where it left off.

Here, air traffic and contrail cirrus changes are quantified for a European domain for March to August 2020 and compared to the same period in 2019. Traffic data show a 72 % reduction in flight distance compared with 2019. This paper investigates the induced contrail changes in a model study. The contrail model results depend on various methodological details as discussed in parameter studies. In the reference case, the reduced traffic caused a reduction in contrail length. The reduction is slightly stronger than expected from the traffic change because the weather conditions in 2020 were less favorable for contrail formation than in 2019. Contrail coverage over Europe with an optical depth larger than 0.1 decreased from 4.6 % in 2019 to 1.4 % in 2020;the total cirrus cover amount changed by 28 % to 25 %. The reduced contrail coverage caused 70 % less longwave and 73 % less shortwave radiative forcing but, because of various nonlinearities, only 54 % less net forcing in this case. The methods include recently developed models for performance parameters and soot emissions. The overall propulsion efficiency of the aircraft is about 20 % smaller than estimated in earlier studies, resulting in 3 % fewer contrails. Considerable sensitivity to soot emissions is found, highlighting fuel and engine importance. The contrail model includes a new approximate method to account for water vapor exchange between contrails and background air and for radiative forcing changes due to contrailCcontrail overlap. The water vapor exchange reduces available ice supersaturation in the atmosphere, which is critical for contrail formation. ContrailCcontrail overlap changes the computed radiative forcing considerably. Comparisons to satellite observations are described and discussed in a parallel publication.","output":"Air traffic and contrail changes over Europe during COVID-19: a model study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improvements in logistics performance are considered to be a significant driver of economic growth.

Previous works generally extract the global image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail, ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT).

We have comprehensively analysed phylogenetic relations between SARS-CoV-2, and the related bat and pangolin Sarbecoviruses sampled so far. Determining the likely recombination events reveals a highly reticulate evolutionary history within this group of coronaviruses. Clustering of the inferred recombination events is non-random with evidence that Spike, the main target for humoral immunity, is beside a recombination hotspot likely driving antigenic shift in the ancestry of bat Sarbecoviruses. Coupled with the geographic ranges of their hosts and the sampling locations, across southern China, and into Southeast Asia, we confirm horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely SARS-CoV-2 progenitor reservoir species. By tracing the recombinant sequence patterns, we conclude that there has been relatively recent geographic movement and co-circulation of these viruses ancestors, extending across their bat host ranges in China and Southeast Asia over the last 100 years or so. We confirm that a direct proximal ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be sampled, since the closest relative shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 approximately 40 years ago. Our analysis highlights the need for more wildlife sampling to (i) pinpoint the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2s animal progenitor, and (ii) survey the extent of the diversity in the related Sarbecoviruses phylogeny that present high risk for future spillover. Highlights The origin of SARS-CoV-2 can be traced to horseshoe bats, genus Rhinolophus, with ranges in both China and Southeast Asia. The closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit frequent transmission among their Rhinolophus host species. Sarbecoviruses have undergone extensive recombination throughout their evolutionary history. Accounting for the mosaic patterns of these recombinants is important when inferring relatedness to SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of annual dengue incidence in Nepal from 2010 to 2019, and the impacts of seasonal meteorological conditions (mean maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation) and elevation on those patterns. RESULTS More than 25 000 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were reported from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological trends suggest that dengue epidemics are cyclical with major outbreaks occurring at 2- to 3-y intervals. A significant negative relationship between dengue incidence and increasing elevation (metres above sea level) driven by temperature was observed (p<0.05) with dengue risk being greatest below 500 m. Risk was moderate between 500 and 1500 m and decreased substantially above 1500 m. Over the last decade, increased nightly temperatures during the monsoon months correlated with increased transmission (p<0.05). No other significant relationship was observed between annual dengue cases or incidence and climatological factors. CONCLUSIONS The spatial analysis and interpretation of dengue incidence over the last decade in Nepal confirms that dengue is now a well-established public health threat of increasing importance, particularly in low elevation zones and urbanised areas with a tropical or subtropical climate.

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. INTERPRETATION: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators.

This is partly because evidence for which genes are implicated in testis size variation tends to come from investigations involving just one or a few species. Contemporary comparative phylogenetic methods provide an opportunity to test candidate genes for their role in phenotypic change at a macro-evolutionary scale-across species and over millions of years. Previous attempts to detect genotype-phenotype associations across species have been limited in that they can only detect where genes have driven directional selection (e.g. brain size increase). RESULTS: Here, we introduce an approach that uses rates of evolutionary change to overcome this limitation to test whether any of twelve candidate genes have driven testis size evolution across tetrapod vertebrates-regardless of directionality. We do this by seeking a relationship between the rates of genetic and phenotypic evolution. Our results reveal five genes (Alkbh5, Dmrtb1, Pld6, Nlrp3, Sp4) that each have played unique and complex roles in tetrapod testis size diversity. In all five genes, we find strong significant associations between the rate of protein-coding substitutions and the rate of testis size evolution. Such an association has never, to our knowledge, been tested before for any gene or phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new approach to tackle one of the most fundamental questions in biology: how do individual genes give rise to biological diversity?

By comparison, negative emotions were the only significant predictor of COVID-19 information sharing ( = .12, p = .002) within weak-tie networks ( = .04, p = .31 for beliefs about sharing). CONCLUSION: People may share COVID-19 information within weak-tie networks to cope with negative emotions regardless of whether they perceive information sharing as beneficial to disease prevention. INNOVATION: Health educators should raise peoples awareness of the psychological motivators of COVID-19 information sharing to create a healthy information environment for disease prevention.","output":"Psychological antecedents of COVID-19 information sharing within strong-tie and weak-tie networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel strategy to combat malaria was tested using a methodology adapted to a complex setting in the Amazon region and a hard-to-reach, mobile community. The intervention strategy tested was the distribution, after training, of malaria self-management kits to gold miners who cross the Surinamese and Brazilian borders with French Guiana to work illegally in the remote mining sites in the forest of this French overseas entity. MAIN TEXT: This article aims at presenting all process and implementation outcomes following the Conceptual Framework of Implementation Fidelity i.e. adherence, including content and exposure, and moderators, comprising participant responsiveness, quality of delivery, facilitation strategies, and context. The information sources are the post-intervention survey, data collected longitudinally during the intervention, a qualitative study, data collected during an outreach mission to a remote gold mining site, supervisory visit reports, in-depth feedback from the project implementers, and videos self-recorded by facilitators based on opened ended questions. As expected, being part of or close to the study community was an essential condition to enable deliverers, referred to as facilitators, to overcome the usual wariness of this gold mining population. Overall, the content of the intervention was in line with what was planned. With an estimated one third of the population reached, exposure was satisfactory considering the challenging context, but improvable by increasing ad hoc off-site distribution according to needs. Participant responsiveness was the main strength of the intervention, but could be enhanced by reducing the duration of the process to get a kit, which could be disincentive in some places. Regarding the quality of delivery, the main issue was the excess of information provided to participants rather than a lack of information, but this was corrected over time. The expected decrease in malaria incidence became a source of reduced interest in the kit. Expanding the scope of facilitators responsibilities could be a suitable response. Better articulation with existing malaria management services is recommended to ensure sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: These findings supplement the evaluation outcomes for assessing the relevance of the strategy and provide useful information to perpetuate and transfer it in comparable contexts.

Here, using in vitro infection models, we show that hypothalamic NSCs (htNSCs) Ex/Mv provided an innate immunity protection against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, enhanced antiviral actions were achieved by using induced Ex/Mv that were derived from induced htNSCs through twice being exposed to several RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genome, a process that was designed not to involve protein translation of these RNA fragments. The increased antiviral effects of these induced Ex/Mv were associated with increased expression of piRNA species some of which could predictably target SARS-CoV-2 genome. Knockout of piRNA-interacting protein PIWIL2 in htNSCs led to reductions in both innate and induced antiviral effects of Ex/Mv in targeting SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, this study demonstrates a case suggesting Ex/Mv from certain cell types have innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and the PIWI-piRNA system is important for these antiviral actions.","output":"Exosomes/microvesicles target SARS-CoV-2 via innate and RNA-induced immunity with PIWI-piRNA system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) as an ultra-brief screener of depression and anxiety in the Philippines during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data from 4,524 non-clinical community respondents aged 18-73 years old was collected online between March and July 2020. We evaluated the screeners factor structure, measurement invariance, and criterion-related validity using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multigroup CFA, and structural equation modeling (SEM), respectively. We also evaluated the accuracy of the PHQ-4 cut-off scores by comparing the them with the screeners full scales (i.e., PHQ-9 and GAD-7). Using the cutoff scores of the screeners, we also estimated the prevalence rates of depression and anxiety. The PHQ-4 has good internal reliability (Cronbachs  = 0.82). The CFA results show that the two-factor model has an excellent model fit that is superior to the one-factor model. The two-factor model held through increasingly constrained multigroup CFA models across gender, age, and geographical location groups, demonstrating measurement invariance. The SEM model supported the PHQ-4s theoretical association to stress, negative affect, and positive affect, supporting the screeners criterion-related validity. In estimating prevalence rates, among those screened by the PHQ-4 cut-off scores for depression (n = 1,905, 42.11%) and anxiety (n = 1,853, 40.96%), 81.78% and 94.06% were consequently screened by the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively. This study supports the reliability, validity, and measurement invariance of the PHQ-4 as an ultra-brief screener of depression and anxiety in a large community sample in Southeast Asia.

The impact of the removal of mask restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students, educators/staff, and their households is not well known. METHODS: We used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students across 12 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels (reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and four student vaccination levels (0%, 25%, 50% and 70% coverage). For each scenario, we varied observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases/100,000 people/day) and mitigation effectiveness (0C100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate), and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least one in-school transmission, and (2) average increase in total infections among students, educators/staff, and their household members associated with moving from more to less intensive mitigation measures. RESULTS: Over 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of estimated additional infections in the immediate school community associated with changes in mitigation measures varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a community incidence of approximately 2/100,000/day. Once students are vaccinated, thresholds shift substantially higher. LIMITATIONS: The interpretation of model results should be limited by the uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with decreased testing capacity. CONCLUSION: Despite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students, educators/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations for students can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.","output":"Model-estimated relationship between elementary school-related SARS-CoV-2 transmission, mitigation interventions, and vaccination coverage across community incidence levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this first\\\\person account, we describe the changes we made to align our graduate student\\\\level community psychology class with a healing justice model.

Using baboons, we previously demonstrated that xenografts from GalT-KO swine (lacking Gal) provided wound coverage comparable with allografts with systemic immunosuppression. In this study, we investigate topical immunosuppression as an alternative to prolong xenograft survival. Full-thickness wounds in baboons were created and covered with xenogeneic and allogeneic split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Animals were treated with slow-release (TyroSphere-encapsulated) topical formulations (cyclosporine-A [CSA] or Tacrolimus) applied 1) directly to the STSGs only, or 2) additionally to the wound bed before STSG and 1). Topical CSA did not improve either xenograft or allograft survival (median: treated grafts = 12.5 days, control = 14 days; P = 0.27) with similar results when topical Tacrolimus was used. Pretreatment of wound beds resulted in a significant reduction of xenograft survival compared with controls (10 vs 14 days; P = 0.0002), with comparable results observed in allografts. This observation was associated with marked reduction of inflammation on histology with Tacrolimus and not CSA. Prolongation of allograft and xenograft survival after application to full-thickness wound beds was not achieved with the current formulation of topical immunosuppressants.

Current subtype-based variant surveillance depending on prior subtype assignment according to lag features and their continuous risk assessment may delay this process. We proposed a weighted network framework to model the frequency trajectories of mutations (FTMs) for SARS-CoV-2 variant tracing, without requiring prior subtype assignment. This framework modularizes the FTMs and conglomerates synchronous FTMs together to represent the variants. It also generates module clusters to unveil the epidemic stages and their contemporaneous variants. Eventually, the module-based variants are assessed by phylogenetic tree through sub-sampling to facilitate communication and control of the epidemic. This process was benchmarked using worldwide GISAID data, which not only demonstrated all the methodology features but also showed the module-based variant identification had highly specific and sensitive mapping with the global phylogenetic tree. When applying this process to regional data like India and South Africa for SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance, the approach clearly elucidated the national dispersal history of the viral variants and their co-circulation pattern, and provided much earlier warning of Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529). In summary, our work showed that the weighted network modeling of FTMs enables us to rapidly and easily track down SARS-CoV-2 variants overcoming prior viral subtyping with lag features, accelerating the understanding and surveillance of COVID-19.","output":"A New Way to Trace SARS-CoV-2 Variants Through Weighted Network Analysis of Frequency Trajectories of Mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgical services are preparing to scale up in areas affected by COVID-19.

METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT. Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas.

Elevated responses, particularly to the -CoV OC43, were observed in all natural infection cohorts tested and were correlated with the response to SARS-CoV-2. The kinetics of this response and isotypes involved suggest that infection boosts preexisting antibody lineages raised against prior endemic CoV exposure that cross-react. While further research is needed to discern whether this recalled response is desirable or detrimental, the boosted antibodies principally targeted the better-conserved S2 subdomain of the viral spike and were not associated with neutralization activity. In contrast, vaccination with a stabilized spike mRNA vaccine did not robustly boost cross-reactive antibodies, suggesting differing antigenicity and immunogenicity. In sum, this study provides evidence that antibodies targeting endemic CoV are robustly boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection but not to vaccination with stabilized S, and that depending on conformation or other factors, the S2 subdomain of the spike protein triggers a rapidly recalled, IgG-dominated response that lacks neutralization activity.","output":"Boosting of cross-reactive antibodies to endemic coronaviruses by SARS-CoV-2 infection but not vaccination with stabilized spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the dependence structure, risk spillovers and conditional diversification benefits (CDBs) between oil and six non-ferrous metals futures markets (aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc), using a variety of copula functions and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) measure.

Intravenous injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam induced a significant change in the camel leukogram, which is characterized by reduced cell numbers of all leukocyte subpopulations. In vitro analysis of cell vitality revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes, which may be responsible for the lornoxicam-induced leukocytopenia in vivo. Functional ex vivo and in vitro analysis of the key antimicrobial functions, phagocytosis and ROS production indicates inhibitory effects of lornoxicam on the antimicrobial capacity of the blood phagocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, lornoxicam induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes, characterized by reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased expression of CD163 molecules. The present study identified for the first time inhibitory effects of the COX-inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood immune cells and recommends considering these effects when using lornoxicam in camel medicine. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Lornoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, antiphlogistic and antipyretic effects. The improved tolerance of lornoxicam due to the relatively shorter elimination half-life in comparison to other members of the oxicams may favor its application in the management of pain and inflammation in race dromedary camels. There are no studies conducted yet on the immunomodulatory or immunotoxilogic effect of lornoxicam in camels. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood leukocytes; (2) Methods: Using flow cytometry, blood leukocyte composition, monocyte phenotype, and antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes were analyzed ex vivo after a single dose injection with lornoxicam. In addition, the effect of in vitro incubation of camel blood with lornoxicam on leukocyte cell vitality and antimicrobial functions were evaluated; (3) Results: The injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam resulted in a significant change in their leukogram with reduced numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Within the lymphocyte population, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells, æ T cells, and B cells decreased significantly in blood after injection of camels with lornoxicam. In addition, injection of lornoxicam resulted in decreased abundance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased abundance of the scavenger receptor CD163 on blood monocytes, indicating an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes. Functionally, administration of lornoxicam decreased the capacity of camel neutrophils and monocytes to uptake bacteria and to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) after bacterial stimulation. Similarly, the in vitro whole blood incubation with lornoxicam resulted in reduced phagocytosis and ROS production activity of the camel blood phagocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of cell vitality, including cell necrosis and apoptosis, revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes; (4) Conclusions: Lornoxicam administration, at the dose and intervals utilized herein, induces significant changes in the phenotype and function of camel blood leukocytes. The reduced cell numbers of all studied leukocyte subpopulations in lornoxicam-treated camels, which seems to be a result of enhanced cell apoptosis, indicates an inhibitory effect rather than a modulatory effect of lornoxicam on the camel immune system, which need to be considered when using lornoxicam in camel medicine.","output":"Immunomodulatory Effects of the Cyclooxygenase Inhibitor Lornoxicam on Phenotype and Function of Camel Blood Leukocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the agent that causes COVID-19, invades epithelial cells, including those of the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, using angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as a receptor. Subsequent inflammation can promote rapid virus clearance, but severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an inefficient immune response that fails to clear the infection. Using primary epithelial organoids from human colon, we explored how the central antiviral mediator IFN-?3, which is elevated in COVID-19, affects epithelial cell differentiation, ACE2 expression, and susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. In mouse and human colon, ACE2 is mainly expressed by surface enterocytes. Inducing enterocyte differentiation in organoid culture resulted in increased ACE2 production. IFN-?3 treatment promoted differentiation into mature KRT20+ enterocytes expressing high levels of ACE2, increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and resulted in enhanced virus production in infected cells. Similarly, infection-induced epithelial interferon signaling promoted enterocyte maturation and enhanced ACE2 expression.

Currently, there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease. We constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors that can express shRNAs, which inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively in mammalian cells. METHODS: In this study, we designed several plasmids that express small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNA) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and envelope (E) protein, respectively. Effective shRNA molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified, and then constructed into adenovirus vectors. The effects of adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA on SARS-CoV gene expression were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase activity assays. RESULTS: The levels of viral mRNAs and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibited in cell lines after being infected with the recombinant adenoviruses that expressed specific shRNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for shRNA delivery and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA.

In this work, the influence of human mobility is evaluated by analyzing a sequence of correlations of dengue incidence between cities in southeastern Brazil. The methodology initially identifies the cities were the epidemy begins, considered as focus for that epidemic year. The strength of the linear association between all pairs of cities were calculated identifying the cities which have high correlations with the focus-cities. The correlations are also calculated between all pairs considering a time lag of 1, 2 or 3 weeks ahead for all cities except the focus ones. Centred differences of the notification number are used to detect the outbreaks. The tests were made with DATASUS-SINAN data of the state of Rio de Janeiro, from January 2008 to December 2013. Preliminary results indicate that the spread of dengue from one city to another can be characterized by the development of the sequence of shifted correlations.

Understanding the interactions between these systems is essential to develop strategies for effective management of the built environment and its inhabitants to enhance public health and well-being. Numerous studies have been conducted to characterize the microbiomes of the built environment. This review summarizes current progress in understanding the interactions between attributes of built environments and occupant behaviors that shape the structure and dynamics of indoor microbial communities. In addition, this review also discusses the challenges and future research needs in the field of microbiomes of the built environment that necessitate research beyond the basic characterization of microbiomes in order to gain an understanding of the causal mechanisms between the built environment, occupants, and microbiomes, which will provide a knowledge base for the development of transformative intervention strategies toward healthy built environments. The pressing need to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments highlights the urgency and significance of understanding the complex interactions between the built environment, occupants, and microbiomes, which is the focus of this review.","output":"Understanding building-occupant-microbiome interactions toward healthy built environments: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the past several decades, US mortality declines have lagged behind other high-income countries. However, scant attention has been devoted to how US mortality variability compares with other countries. OBJECTIVE: We examine trends in mortality and mortality variability in the US and 16 peer countries from 1980 through 2016. METHODS: We employ the Human Mortality Database and demographic techniques C with a focus on patterns in the interquartile (IQR), interdecile (IDR), and intercentile (ICR) ranges of survivorship C to better understand US mortality and mortality variability trends in comparative perspective. RESULTS: Compared to other high-income countries, the US: (1) mortality ranking has slipped for nearly all age groups; (2) is losing its old age mortality advantage; (3) has seen growth in relative age-specific mortality gaps from infancy through midlife; and (4) exhibits greater concentrations of deaths from infancy through adulthood, resulting in much greater mortality variability. CONCLUSIONS: We contribute to calls for renewed attention to the relatively low and lagging US life expectancy. The ICR draws particular attention to the comparatively high US early and midlife mortality. CONTRIBUTION: We find comparatively high variability in US mortality. Further reductions in early and midlife mortality could diminish variability, reduce years of potential life lost, and increase life expectancy. Consistent with previous research, we encourage policymakers to focus on reducing the unacceptably high early and midlife mortality in the US. And we urge researchers to more frequently monitor and track mortality variation in conjunction with mortality rates and life expectancy estimates.","output":"Greater mortality variability in the United States in comparison with peer countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 revolution has demanded that higher education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa, as in most other countries globally, migrate to a digitalised curriculum (DC). The DC is a plan for or of digital technology-driven education. The COVID-19 revolution compelled the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) to migrate to a DC in order to complete the 2020 academic year or calendar. Pragmatism, critical discourse analysis (CDA), and community of inquiry (CoI) with natural identity (NI) framed the document analysis used to generate data for this study. Purposive convenience sampling was used to select the published documents that carry information on the migration to a DC at UKZN. It was for this reason that this study explored and understood the migration to a DC at UKZN through the use of digital resources. Findings suggested that, while the UKZN had the professional identity of migration through engaging Moodle, it began the migration through the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, and Zoom video conferencing technology (ZVCT), promoting societal identity. The migration seemed to miss the personal or pragmatic identity as an important ingredient of a DC, which addresses individual personal needs. Consequently, this study recommends a DC that balances performance-based, competence-based, and pragmatic/personal identities in order to address professional, societal, and personal needs, respectively, for natural identity realisation.","output":"Exploring the Migration to a Digitalised Curriculum at UKZN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a recently described complication in the late phase of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection involving systemic hyperinflammation and multiorgan dysfunction.

Aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between validated predictive scores for VTE such as IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD and: (1) Intensification of Care (IoC, admission to Pulmonology Department or Intensive Care Unit) (2) in-hospital mortality rate 3) 30-days mortality rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 51 adult patients with laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and calculated IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD scores. All patients underwent venous color-Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs to assess the presence of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with normal values of D-dimer did not receive heparin therapy (LMWH); patients with &#8805; 4 ULN values of D-dimer or with a diagnosis of DVT were treated with therapeutic LMWH dosage, while the remaining patients were treated with prophylactic LMWH dosages. RESULTS: We found strong relations between IMPROVE score and the need for IoC and with the in-hospital mortality rate and between the IMPROVEDD score and the need for IoC. We defined that an IMPROVE score greater than 4 points was significantly associated to in-hospital mortality rate (p = 0.05), while an IMPROVEDD score greater than 3 points was associated with the need for IoC (p = 0.04). Multivariate logistic analysis showed how IMPROVE score was significantly associated to in-hospital and 30-days mortality rates.

Methods: A cross-sectional web survey was designed by members of the Arab League of Associations for Rheumatology (ArLAR), validated by its scientific committee and disseminated through e-mail and social media. It included close-ended questions about the impact of the pandemic on the activities (in percentage, where 100% corresponds to complete suspension), and open-ended questions about unmet needs. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors of impact. Suggestions were developed to improve practice. Results: A total of 858 rheumatologists were included in the analysis (27.3% of registered), 37% were 35-44 years-old, 60% were females and 48% worked in the private sector. The impact of COVID-19 was a decrease of 69% in hospitalizations, 65% in outpatient clinic, 56% in infusion centers and 43% in income. It was associated with the region (highest in the Gulf), the use of telemedicine, the impact on income and the practice sector (lowest in private).

However, prolonged RNA fragment shedding and intermittent detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus via PCR testing among infected patients may hamper interpretation of laboratory-identified events. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of late-onset SARS-CoV-2 laboratory events using clinical criteria, to evaluate the feasibility of a Lab-ID approach to detection of nosocomial SARS-COV-2 infection. METHODS: We evaluated all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive results recovered from patients at two acute-care hospitals in Chicago, IL, during March 1  November 30, 2020. Each hospital maintained stringent infection control policies through-out the study period. Through chart review (WT & CS), we categorized all initial SARS-CoV-2 positive tests collected > Hospital Day 5 (defined as late-onset based on the 5-day mean incubation period for COVID-19) into the following clinical categories: Community Acquired; Unlikely Hospital Acquired; Possible Hospital Acquired; and Probable Hospital Acquired. Categorizations were made using hospital day, symptoms, alternative diagnoses, and clinical notes (Figure 1). [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of 2,671 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, most positive tests (n=2,551; 96%) were recovered pre-admit or by Hospital Day 2; first positive tests were uncommon during Hospital Days 6 to 14 (n=40; 1.5%); and rare after Hospital Day 14 (n=15; 0.6%). By chart review, of the 55 late-onset records reviewed, categorizations in descending order were: Prior positive at outside facility (n=23); Possible Hospital Acquired (n=16); Community Acquired (n=12); Probable Hospital Acquired (n=4). Less than half of the late-onset cases were categorized as a possible or probable hospital acquisition (Figure 2). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was uncommon. Most late-onset episodes of SARS-CoV-2 were explained by detection at an outside healthcare facility or by delayed diagnosis of patients with symptoms at time of presentation.

This stoppage has led to the cancellation of a large number of hip and knee arthroplasties. The effect of this on patients' physical mental and economic health is unknown. METHODS: A survey was developed by the AAHKS Research Committee to assess pain, anxiety, physical function, and economic ability of patients to undergo a delayed operation. Six institutions conducted the survey to 360 patients who had to have elective hip and knee arthroplasty cancelled between March and July of 2020. RESULTS: Patients were most anxious about the uncertainty of when their operation could be rescheduled. Although 85% of patients understood and agreed with the public health measures to curb infections, almost 90% of patients plan to reschedule as soon as possible. Age and geographic region of the patients affected their anxiety. Younger patients were more likely to have financial concerns and concerns about job security. Patients in the Northeast were more concerned about catching COVID-19 during a future hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from the pain of hip and knee arthritis continue to struggle with pain from their end-stage disease. They have anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. Few patients feel they will be limited financially and 90% want to have surgery as soon as possible.

Local extinction of the disease could be possible if the susceptible population gets depleted. In large communities, the tendency of eventual damp down of recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability. But, in small communities, the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain threshold. Critical community size (CCS) is considered to be the mentioned threshold, at which the infection is as likely as not to die out after a major epidemic for small communities unless reintroduced from outside. The determination of CCS could aid in devising systematic control strategies to eradicate the infectious disease from small communities. In this article, we have come up with a simplified computation based approach to deduce the CCS of HIV disease dynamics. We consider a deterministic HIV model proposed by Silva and Torres, and following N?sell, introduce stochasticity in the model through time-varying population sizes of different compartments. Besides, Metcalfs group observed that the relative risk of extinction of some infections on islands is almost double that in the mainlands i.e. infections cease to exist at a significantly higher rate in islands compared to the mainlands. They attributed this phenomenon to the greater recolonization in the mainlands. Interestingly, the application of our method on demographic facts and figures of countries in the AIDS belt of Africa led us to expect that existing control measures and isolated locations would assist in temporary eradication of HIV infection much faster. For example, our method suggests that through systematic control strategies, after 7.36 years HIV epidemics will temporarily be eradicated from different communes of island nation Madagascar, where the population size falls below its CCS value, unless the disease is reintroduced from outside.","output":"Determination of critical community size from an HIV/AIDS model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Aspiration, infections, and fever are common in the first days after stroke, especially in older patients.

The physicochemical properties and safety parameters of the vaccine construct were assessed through bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The molecular docking analysis between TLR4/MD2 and the proposed vaccine candidate demonstrated a satisfactory interaction.

METHODS In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0 %, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0 %, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8 % (11/16), 77.8 % (7/9), 100.0 % (2/2), specificity of 85.7 % (12/14), 76.2 % (16/21), 92.9 % (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 % (23/30), 76.7 % (23/30), 93.3 % (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","output":"A Clinical Study of Noninvasive Assessment of Lung Lesions in Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) by Bedside Ultrasound."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), a rare thrombotic event that can cause serious neurologic deficits, has been reported after some ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are few reports of associations between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and CVT. We retrospectively analyzed CVT occurrence, time of onset after vaccination, outcomes (recovered/not recovered), and death after COVID-19 vaccination from adverse drug reactions (ADR) reports in VigiBase. A disproportionality analysis was performed regarding COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We identified 756 (0.07%) CVT cases (620 (0.05%) after BNT162b2 and 136 (0.01%) after mRNA-1273) of 1,154,023 mRNA vaccine-related ADRs. Significant positive safety signals were noted for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (95% lower end of information component = 1.56; reporting odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.27). The median days to CVT onset differed significantly between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines (12 (interquartile range, 3C22) and 11 (interquartile range, 7C16), respectively; p = 0.02). Fewer CVT patients died after receiving mRNA vaccines than after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22C0.45; p < 0.001). We noted a potential safety signal for CVT occurrence after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Therefore, awareness about the risk of CVT, even after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, is necessary.","output":"Association of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis with mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines: A Disproportionality Analysis of the World Health Organization Pharmacovigilance Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, more people are treating dogs as family members. This reflects their increased attention towards their nutrition, with renewed interest for non-conventional diets such as Biologically Appropriate Raw Food/ Bones and Raw Food in United States (BARF) or homemade. In previous studies, owners feeding their dog non-conventional diets reported lower levels of trust in veterinary advice. The aim of the study was to identify differences in lifestyle between owners feeding dogs non-conventional diets and those feeding conventional diets (i.e., dry/wet pet food) to give further insight for improving communication between veterinarians and owners. RESULTS: A total of 426 surveys were usable. Fifteen percent of the participants lived in the metropole of Paris and had more than one dog (mean 1.72 dogs). Thirty-eight percent of the survey respondents stated that their dogs were fed exclusively with non-conventional diets, while 55% declared using conventional diets alone (not considering treats). The study canine population was for the most part neutered (63%) and purebred (68%). Amongst owners feeding conventional diets exclusively, 47% determined how much food to feed by consulting the feeding guidelines on the packaging, and only 28% said that the amount of food was prescribed by their veterinarian or veterinary nurse. Out of the participants feeding non-conventional diets, 65% declared that the information for formulating the recipes was gathered on the internet or in non-veterinary books. When compared with owners feeding exclusively conventional diets, those feeding non-conventional diets were living more frequently outside the metropole of Paris, had fewer children (0.23  0.57 vs 0.37  0.78; p = 0.03) and had more frequently other animals. They also dewormed less often their pets, walked their dog more each day (91 vs 78%; p < 0.001) and without leash for more than 6 h per week (46 vs 31%; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This survey described differences in the habits of owners feeding dogs non-conventional diets in comparison with those feeding conventional diets. Data suggest that owners using non-conventional diets may be more attentive to the ethological needs of their dog which could be a starting point for practitioners for achieving better client-veterinarian communication.

Multiple lines of evidence, including documented expression of receptor proteins on gastrointestinal epithelial cells, in vivo viral replication in gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines, extended fecal shedding of respiratory viruses, and the ability to remain infectious in food environments for extended periods of time raises the theoretical ability of some human respiratory viruses, particularly human coronaviruses and AVI, to spread via food.

While difficulties meeting physical activity recommendations are common in the general population, those who have undergone MBS may have unique psychological barriers to activity that impede success, including negative associations with physical activity that are related to a long history with obesity, weight stigma, and physical limitations. This qualitative study aimed to better understand the positive and negative emotional experiences of post-MBS patients with regard to physical activity to inform the development of an emotion-focused intervention to increase physical activity after MBS. METHODS: Adults who had MBS in the past 2 years completed semi-structured interviews and psychological/behavioral questionnaires. After transcription, a codebook was developed using inductive and deductive methods. Coded data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Participants were 23 adults (78% female). Contexts that contributed to positive emotions during physical activity included an enjoyable type of exercise, social interaction, mindfulness during exercise, and mastery. Contexts that contributed to negative affect were more unique to the MBS population, including all-or-nothing thinking about exercise, using distraction, depression, negative body image, exercising only for weight loss, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: For most participants, emotional factors were relevant in the decision to be physically active and in their ability to maintain their habits. An intervention that encourages factors that lead to positive affect and addresses factors that lead to negative affect could be effective in increasing physical activity following MBS.

These experiments are increasingly being applied in understanding the complex impacts of heavy metals, ocean acidification, global warming, and oil spills. The insights of the present review indicate how metals and metal-bound activities impact on various aspects of ecological complexities like prey predator cues, growth, embryonic development, and reproduction. Plankton and benthos are used more often over fish and microbes owing to their smaller size, faster reproduction, amenability, and repeatability during mesocosm experiments. The results of ocean acidification reveal calcification of plankton, corals, alteration of pelagic structures, and plankton blooms. The subtle effect of oil spills is amplified on sediment microorganisms, primary producers, and crustaceans. An overview of the mesocosm designs over the years indicates that gradual changes have evolved in the type, size, design, composition, parameters, methodology employed, and the outputs obtained. Most of the pelagic and benthic mesocosm designs involve consideration of interactions within the water columns, between water and sediments, trophic levels, and nutrient rivalry. Mesocosm structures are built considering physical processes (tidal currents, turbulence, inner cycling of nutrients, thermal stratification, and mixing), biological complexities (population, community, and ecosystem) using appropriate filling containers, and sampling facilities that employ inert materials. The principle of design is easy transportation, mooring, deployment, and free floating structures besides addressing the unique ecosystem-based science problems.

The pandemic has caused a spiral of supplyCdemand shocks that brings about several market failures that make necessary a public intervention to assure the return to health security in the first place and then to restore economic growth and reduce unemployment. Fiscal policy has to intervene both to cover health expenses and sustain families income and firms fixed costs, and to create the basis for a future recovery through investment. To guarantee the stability of the resulting higher public debt, expansionary monetary policies have been implemented even in a non-conventional way. In the euro area, among other measures, a pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) has been adopted, through which the European Central Bank (ECB) has been buying temporarily existing public debt on the secondary market. We ask whether the ECB should go even further monetising permanently on the primary markets the public debt of euro area countries or relieving a fraction of the debt that they are currently holding. An alternative possibility would be the issuance of perpetual bonds to be bought by the central bank. Needless to say, such measures are rather controversial, not only considering their political feasibility, but also for the feared effects on the central banks anti-inflationary credibility and on moral hazard. We argue that a sufficiently strong political will might help overcoming the objection regarding feasibility. Central banks anti-inflationary credibility may not necessarily be a concern: according to the credibility theory, in the case of unexpected shocks, no credibility can be gained by following policies that are not credible themselves. On the other hand, moral hazard cannot be an issue when a given measure is fully justified by the occurrence of extraordinary circumstances. Finally, we show that when the economy is hit by a stochastic shock, a moderate inflation might well be optimal, as it would allow a reduction of the unemployment rate.","output":"The credibility of monetary policy and the fiscal response to the pandemic in the Eurozone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an unprecedented health crisis. The most common chronic illness among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is hypertension. Immune dysregulation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the development of hypertension; however, the dynamic immunological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension remain largely unclear. METHODS: In total, 258 hypertensive patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) and CD38(+)PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells, IFN(+)CD4(+) and IFN(+)CD8(+) T cells, the titers of IgG, IgM, and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and SARS-CoV-2 throat viral loads were measured weekly over 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Clinical outcomes were also monitored. FINDINGS: CD4(+) T lymphopenia was observed in 100% of the severe and critical cases. Compared with the surviving patients, the patients with fatal outcomes exhibited high and prolonged expression of CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) and CD38(+)PD-1(+) on CD8(+) T cells, low expression of SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN(+)CD4(+) and IFN(+)CD8(+) T cells, low titers of IgG, IgM, and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and high SARS-CoV-2 viral load during the illness. In the surviving patients, the viral load was significantly inversely correlated with SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN(+)CD8(+)and IFN(+)CD4(+) T cells, IgG, IgM, and IgA. INTERPRETATION: T lymphopenia is common in critical or severe COVID-19 cases with hypertension. Prolonged activation and exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells were associated with severe disease.

We examine the utility and feasibility of remote proctoring for IPP surgical skills training using a full-procedural hydrogel simulation model. METHODS: 9 urology residents at the University of Rochester (PGY 1-4) were paired and remotely proctored by an expert at Boston University using the Zoom web conferencing tool. During IPP training sessions, both participants and proctor were given a model with a full surgical setup. Pre-learning included a narrated full-procedural demonstration by the proctor followed by a full procedure IPP simulation guided by proctor feedback. Pre- and post-training surveys assessed confidence (0-100) and procedural knowledge (15 questions). Opinions on virtual learning and its application to this training session were collected. RESULTS: 66.7% of residents never performed a live IPP placement, while the remaining completed a median (IQR) of 6 cases (4.5-8). All confidence and knowledge measures significantly increased after the remote session (Table 1). Knowledge assessment scores increased by 13% following the remote session, which was reflected in a 48%, 22% and 18% increase in participants' confidence in the ability to perform a simulated IPP procedure, knowledge of IPP procedural steps and applied anatomy respectively. Despite, 77.8% of residents with no prior experience with hands-on virtual training, 100% found remote training valuable and beneficial for learning basic IPP skills and steps of the procedure. The residents highly rated the ability to practice complex skills with zero-patient harm (88.9%), the non-biohazardous nature of the model (66.7%), and having their own hydrogel training model (88.9%). The limitations include single session, lower quality communication and lack of an interface for physical guidance within the virtual environment. CONCLUSIONS: Remote proctoring using a web conferencing tool and non-biohazardous IPP simulation model is feasible with improvement in both confidence and procedural knowledge. Despite its limitations, this approach provides opportunities for hands-on training with remote experts in a safe environment during the cessation of in-person training events.","output":"Virtual learning with remote proctoring for inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) training: A feasibility study for socially distanced education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The murder of George Floyd centered Minneapolis, Minnesota, in conversations on racial injustice in the US.

We used data from a community-based survey, \\"COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion\\", which includes data regarding intention to take COVID-19 vaccines, health status, and risk perception in Portugal from September 2020 to January 2021. We used multinomial regression to identify factors associated with intention to delay or refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Portugal was high: 56% would wait and 9% refuse. Several factors were associated with both refusal and delay: being younger, loss of income during the pandemic, no intention of taking the flu vaccine, low confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and the health service response during the pandemic, worse perception of government measures, perception of the information provided as inconsistent and contradictory, and answering the questionnaire before the release of information regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. It is crucial to build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine as its perceived safety and efficacy were strongly associated with intention to take the vaccine.

We hypothesized that an international Grand Rounds using the Microsoft HoloLens2 extended reality (XR) headset creates an improved bedside-learning experience compared with traditional Grand Rounds formats. Methods: In December 2020, we hosted (through partnership with the University of Michigan and Imperial College of London) the worlds first International Grand Rounds experience using the HoloLens2 XR headset broadcasting transatlantic bedside rounding on 3 complex surgical patients to an international audience of 154 faculty, residents, and medical trainees. Participants completed qualitative pre- and post-event surveys. Results: Of the 154 participants, 96 (62%) completed pre-surveys and 70 (45%) completed both the pre-and post-surveys. Respondents (average age 39.3 years [43% women;57% men;80 US;16 UK]) included 30 medical students, 30 faculty, 7 residents, and 29 hospital administrators. Pre-event survey: 76% had little or no experience before with XR devices;92% thought development/implementation of XR medical curricula was valuable;and 96% felt tele-rounding using XR technology was important for the current era.

The activation of inflammasome in the host infected by SARS-CoV-2 is highly related to cytokine storm and hypercoagulopathy, which significantly contribute to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even though many studies have shown the host defense mechanism induced by inflammasome against various viral infections, mechanistic interactions leading to downstream cellular responses and pathogenesis in COVID-19 remain unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with numerous cardiovascular disorders including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The inflammatory response triggered by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome under certain cardiovascular conditions resulted in hyperinflammation or the modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways. Perturbations of several target cells and tissues have been described in inflammasome activation, including pneumocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. The interplay between inflammasome activation and hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is an emerging area to be further addressed. Targeted therapeutics to suppress inflammasome activation may have a positive effect on the reduction of hyperinflammation-induced hypercoagulopathy and cardiovascular disorders occurring as COVID-19 complications.","output":"Inflammasome Activation-Induced Hypercoagulopathy: Impact on Cardiovascular Dysfunction Triggered in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

These actions expanded the scope and scale of the collaborations with these sectors, as well as establishing a quality assurance system in VET. Additionally, the greater proportion of on-the-job training programs established through these reforms have increased students' skill development. Research and development centers focusing on intellectual property were established as centers of excellence in VET, and patent, utility model, design, and trademark productions and registration processes were also prioritized during this period. At this point, the Ministry of National Education (MoNE) has taken a new step to improve the quality of VET and alleviate the achievement gap by starting the \\"1,000 Schools in Vocational Education and Training\\" Project. The present study introduces this project and discusses its aims and scope in detail. The project implements a holistic approach towards narrowing the achievement gap, aiming to improve the infrastructure and educational environments of VET schools through considerable investments in school development, as well as building teachers and executive leaders' capacities. Additionally, students' educational and personal development will be supported in a multifaceted way to compensate for deficiencies in basic skills. Parents will also be supported through planned lifelong learning mechanisms. When the initial project has been completed after one year, the improvement in VET will be scaled up to expand to all schools in Turkey. Ideally, the 1,000 Schools Project will help to narrow the achievement gap between high schools in Turkey.","output":"A New Step Towards Narrowing the Achievement Gap in Turkey: \\"1,000 Schools in Vocational Education and Training\\" Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The devastating pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths and left millions of restless patients suffering from its complications. Increasing data indicate that the disease presents in a severe form in patients with pre-existing chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory system diseases, and renal diseases. This indicates that these patients seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 and have higher mortality rates compared to patients with no comorbid conditions. Several factors can explain the heightened susceptibility to and fatal presentation of COVID-19 in these patients, for example, the enhanced expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) in specific organs, cytokine storm, and drug interactions contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality. Adding to the findings that individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to COVID-19, it has also been shown that COVID-19 can induce chronic diseases in previously healthy patients. Therefore, understanding the interlinked relationship between COVID-19 and chronic diseases helps in optimizing the management of susceptible patients. This review comprehensively described the molecular mechanisms that contribute to worse COVID-19 prognosis in patients with pre-existing comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal and renal diseases, blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and finally, obesity. It also focused on how COVID-19 could, in some cases, lead to chronic conditions as a result of long-term multi-organ damage. Lastly, this work carefully discusses the tailored management plans for each specific patient population, aiming to achieve the best therapeutic outcome with minimum complications.","output":"The dynamic association between COVID-19 and chronic disorders: An updated insight into prevalence mechanism and therapeutic modalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Issue Highlights, March 12, 2020Oxygen Therapy for the Critically IllMeasles in New York CityAspirin and Hepatocellular CarcinomaComplications of Unsafe AbortionInterchangeable Insulins","output":"This Week in the Journal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autonomous driving is a technological innovation that involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the automotive area, representing the future of transport and whose applications will influence the concept of driving and many other features of modern society.

Studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-]) can increase in many pathophysiological conditions. In addition, IL-10 as one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines contributes to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Few studies have addressed cytokine levels in calves with NCD. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-10, in the calves naturally infected with NCD syndrome. For this purpose, 87 neonatal calves were monitored for 1 month. Out of this population, 10 cases were diagnosed with NCD and studied as the case group. In addition, a control group was considered that consisted of 10 age- and gender-matched neonatal calves without any diseases. From each calf, 5 ml blood sample was collected into EDTA tubes by jugular venipuncture. The samples were then centrifuged, and the extracted plasmas were aliquoted and stored at -20 C. Finally, the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-) and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured using the ELISA kits based on the manufacturer's protocols. The results showed that the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in the case group than in the control group. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the plasma concentrations of IL-10.

The income gradient, however, was more pronounced in the group with regular employment than the groups in self-employment. The study found clear connections between low income and poor health in all employment groups, but the gradient was more pronounced in the group in regular employment. This suggests that income has a weaker connection to other types of health promoting resources in the self-employed population.

In blood, the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (CP) accounts for the majority of circulating Cu and serves as transport protein. Both Cu and CP behave as positive, whereas serum selenium (Se) and its transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) behave as negative acute phase reactants. In view that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that biomarkers of Cu and Se status are regulated inversely, in relation to disease severity and mortality risk. Serum samples from COVID-19 patients were analysed for Cu by total reflection X-ray fluorescence and CP was quantified by a validated sandwich ELISA. The two Cu biomarkers correlated positively in serum from patients with COVID-19 (R = 0.42, p < 0.001). Surviving patients showed higher mean serum Cu and CP concentrations in comparison to non-survivors ([mean+/?SEM], Cu; 1475.9+/?22.7 vs. 1317.9+/?43.9 g/L; p < 0.001, CP; 547.2.5+/?19.5 vs. 438.8+/?32.9 mg/L, p = 0.086). In contrast to expectations, total serum Cu and Se concentrations displayed a positive linear correlation in the patient samples analysed (R = 0.23, p = 0.003). Serum CP and SELENOP levels were not interrelated. Applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the combination of Cu and SELENOP with age outperformed other combinations of parameters for predicting risk of death, yielding an AUC of 95.0%. We conclude that the alterations in serum biomarkers of Cu and Se status in COVID-19 are not compatible with a simple acute phase response, and that serum Cu and SELENOP levels contribute to a good prediction of survival. Adjuvant supplementation in patients with diagnostically proven deficits in Cu or Se may positively influence disease course, as both increase in survivors and are of crucial importance for the immune response and antioxidative defence systems.","output":"Relation of Serum Copper Status to Survival in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Introduction The efficacy of SARS-CoV2 standard single donor convalescent plasma varied according to the application time and most importantly the amount of antibody that is administered. Single donor plasma has some drawbacks; such as the insufficient levels of neutralizing antibody activities, the requirements of blood group compatibility, and the risk of infection transmission. In this study, the efficacy and safety of pathogen inactivated, isohemagglutinin-depleted (concentrated) and pooled convalescent plasma was investigated. Methods In this study, ACB-IP 1.0 convalescent plasma product was prepared as follows; first, convalescent plasma was collected from different donors, then pathogen-inactivation was carried-out, and isohemagglutinins were cryodepleted, respectively. Finally, concentrated convalescent plasma product was pooled and stored until use. A total of sixteen patients were treated with two different convalescent plasma products. Nine patients were treated with standard single donor convalescent plasma and seven were treated with pathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma (ACB-IP 1.0) between 01 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. The outcomes of these two plasma products were compared regarding SARS-CoV2 antibody titers, neutralizing antibody activities, length of hospitalization and mortality rates. Results Five out of six single donor plasma SARS-CoV2 antibody titers remained below 12 s/co, but the antibody titers of all ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were above 12 s/co. SARS-CoV2 total antibody titers of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma were statistically higher than the antibody titers of single donor plasma. Mean total plasma neutralizing antibody activity of ACB-IP 1.0 plasma (1.5421) was found statistically higher than single donor plasma (0.9642) in 1:256 dilution ({rho}=0.0087) The mortality rate of the patients treated with ACB-IP 1.0 plasma showed statistically lower (p: 0,033) than the patients treated with single donor plasma. The administration of either single donor plasma or ACB-IP 1.0 plasma to the patients within eight days significantly shortened the length of hospitalization compared to administration of either plasma to the patients later than eight days ({rho}= 0,0021) Discussion Pathogen-free, concentrated, pooled convalescent plasma may resolve the bias in SARS-CoV2 antibody titers and neutralizing antibody activities, without requiring blood group compatibility that allows patient accessibility in a shorter time and has safe plasma characteristic.

Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma. Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma transfusion, the patient experienced rapid improvement of pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be related to the immunomodulatory properties of plasma. Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance.

The aim of this study is to test whether decreasing the L-carnitine content represents an effective strategy to decrease accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines and to reduce fatty acid oxidation in order to protect the heart against acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. KEY RESULTS In this study, we used a novel compound, 4-[ethyl(dimethyl)ammonio]butanoate (Methyl-GBB), which inhibits -butyrobetaine dioxygenase (IC?? 3 M) and organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2, IC?? 3 M), and, in turn, decreases levels of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in heart tissue. Methyl-GBB reduced both mitochondrial and peroxisomal palmitate oxidation rates by 44 and 53% respectively. In isolated hearts treated with Methyl-GBB, uptake and oxidation rates of labelled palmitate were decreased by 40%, while glucose oxidation was increased twofold. Methyl-GBB (5 or 20 mgkg(-1)) decreased the infarct size by 45-48%. In vivo pretreatment with Methyl-GBB (20 mgkg(-1)) attenuated the infarct size by 45% and improved 24 h survival of rats by 20-30%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Reduction of L-carnitine and long-chain acylcarnitine content by the inhibition of OCTN2 represents an effective strategy to protect the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced damage.

In winter of 2021-2022, the omicron variant surge made it quickly apparent that although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are less sensitive than qRT-PCR, the accessibility, ease of use, and rapid read-outs of RDTs made them a sought after and often sold-out item at local suppliers. Here, we sought to qualify the BinaxNOWTM test for use in our university testing program as a method to rule in positive or rule out negative individuals quickly when they sought care at our priority qRT-PCR testing site. To perform this qualification study, we collected matched additional swabs from individuals attending this test site for standard of care qRT-PCR testing. All matched swabs were tested using the BinaxNOWTM RDT. 48 of 110 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All samples for which genome sequence could be collected were omicron (41). We observed a calculated sensitivity of 52.1%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 72.9% for the BinaxNOWTM tests (n=110). Sensitivity was improved (75.7%) by changing the qRT-PCR positivity threshold from a CT of 40 to a CT of 30. The ROC curve shows that for qRT-PCR positive CT values between 23-40, the BinaxNOWTM test is of limited value diagnostically.

A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral detection was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Analyses were conducted using univariate statistical methods. Of the 259 infants and young children, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 130 samples (50%). The most prevalent viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 43%; n = 56), adenovirus (15%; n = 20), and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (11%; n = 14). Dual or multiple viral infections were found in 23 cases (18%). The three most prominent symptoms of the cohort were fever (78%; n = 201), tachypnoea (77%; n = 200), and runny nose (61%; n = 158). The majority had bronchiolitis (39%; n = 101) while 37% (n = 96) had pneumonia.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional survey study, 25 COVID-19Crelated items were incorporated into the online Spanish-language survey of an ongoing study. Data were collected between July 15 and October 9, 2020, in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Phoenix, Arizona. A nonrandom sample of 379 adult, Spanish-speaking, noncitizen Latinx immigrants (with either documented or undocumented immigration status) were sent surveys. Of those, 336 individuals (88.7% participation rate) returned surveys, and 43 individuals did not. An additional 213 individuals were screened but ineligible. Descriptive statistics were computed, and mean comparisons and bivariate correlations between sociodemographic variables, indices of immigration risk, and COVID-19Crelated survey items were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Items elicited agreement or disagreement with statements about immigrants access to COVID-19Crelated testing and treatment services and the potential immigration ramifications of using these services. Willingness to identify an undocumented person during contact tracing was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 336 Latinx immigrants completed surveys. The mean (SD) age of participants was 39.7 (8.9) years; 210 participants (62.5%) identified as female, and 216 participants (64.3%) had undocumented immigration status. In total, 89 participants (26.5%) agreed that hospital emergency departments were the only source of COVID-19 testing or treatment for uninsured immigrants, and 106 participants (31.6%) agreed that using public testing and health care services for COVID-19 could jeopardize ones immigration prospects. A total of 96 participants (28.6%) and 114 participants (33.9%), respectively, would not identify an undocumented household member or coworker during contact tracing. Reluctance to identify an undocumented household member or coworker was associated with having had deportation experiences (r = ?0.17; 95% CI, ?0.06 to 0.27; P = .003) but not with the number of years lived in the US (r = 0.07; 95% CI, ?0.16 to 0.17; P = .15) or immigration status (r = 0.03; 95% CI, ?0.07 to 0.13; P = .56).

However, data are limited on the factors associated with neonatal clinical or viral testing outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the percentage of neonates who were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results during the birth hospitalization, the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with neonatal test result positivity, and the clinical and virological outcomes for newborns during hospitalization and 30 days after discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study included 11 academic or community hospitals in Massachusetts and mother-neonate dyads whose delivery and discharge occurred between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Eligible dyads were identified at each participating hospital through local COVID-19 surveillance and infection control systems. Neonates were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results within 14 days before to 72 hours after delivery, and neonates were followed up for 30 days after birth hospital discharge. EXPOSURES: Hypothesized maternal risk factors in neonatal test result positivity included maternal COVID-19 symptoms, vaginal delivery, rooming-in practice, Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, and zip codeCderived social vulnerability index. Delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms was hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse neonatal health outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes for neonates were (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, (2) indicators of adverse health, and (3) clinical signs and viral testing. Test result positivity was defined as at least 1 positive result on a specimen obtained by nasopharyngeal swab using a polymerase chain reactionCbased method. Clinical and testing data were obtained from electronic medical records of nonroutine health care visits within 30 days after hospital discharge. RESULTS: The cohort included 255 neonates (mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 37.9 [2.6] weeks; 62 [24.3%] with low birth weight or preterm delivery) with 250 mothers (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.3] years; 121 [48.4%] were of Hispanic ethnicity). Of the 255 neonates who were born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 225 (88.2%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 (2.2%) had positive results during the birth hospitalization. High maternal social vulnerability was associated with higher likelihood of neonatal test result positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.53-16.01; P = .008), adjusted for maternal COVID-19 symptoms, delivery mode, and rooming-in practice. Adverse outcomes during hospitalization were associated with preterm delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms.

Although emergency departments (ED) see a high volume of patients with HRSN, ED providers have limited time to complete detailed assessments of patients' HRSN and are not always able to provide up-to-date and comprehensive information to patients on available community resources. Electronic, geographically indexed resource database systems have the potential to provide an efficient way for emergency physicians to rapidly identify community resources in settings where immediate social work consultation is not accessible. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of papers examining the use of geographically indexed resource database systems in healthcare to better understand how these services can be used in emergency care. We then conducted simulated, standardized searches using two nationally available databases (211 and Aunt Bertha), applied to a single metropolitan area (Boston). RESULTS: Our systematic review found that most public health and screening interventions using nationally available databases have focused on chronic care needs. A small subset of publications demonstrated that these databases were mobilized during disasters to successfully aid vulnerable populations during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. A total of 408 standardized searches were conducted to identify community resources related to four domains of social needs (food, transportation, housing, and utilities). Although 99% of the resources identified by both databases were relevant to the search domains queried, a significant proportion of the resources identified by each database were restricted to a specific demographic (eg, veterans). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that geographically indexed referral databases may be an effective tool to help ED providers connect patients to nearby community resources during public health emergencies.

Serological surveillance is an important tool to assess the spread of infection in the community. This study attempted to assess the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in Delhi, India during the pre-vaccination period. METHODS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2-2 IgG antibodies were determined in blood donors reporting to the Department of Transfusion medicine at a tertiary care hepatobiliary center, in India from September to October 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against spike subunit 1 protein were measured using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. RESULTS: A total of 1066 blood donors were screened. The overall seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 27.57% (294/1066). The highest seropositivity was seen in the age group 26-35 years, 46.6% (137/492), followed by 18-25 years, 28.2% (83/260), 36-45 years, 19.4% (57/244), and more than 45 years, 5.8% (17/70).

At the end of 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a previously unknown respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The world health organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in the second week of March 2020. Simultaneous deep learning detection and classification of COVID-19 based on the full resolution of digital X-ray images is the key to efficiently assisting patients by enabling physicians to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis decision. In this paper, a simultaneous deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the YOLO predictor is proposed that can detect and diagnose COVID-19, differentiating it from eight other respiratory diseases: atelectasis, infiltration, pneumothorax, masses, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and nodules. The proposed CAD system was assessed via five-fold tests for the multi-class prediction problem using two different databases of chest X-ray images: COVID-19 and ChestX-ray8. The proposed CAD system was trained with an annotated training set of 50,490 chest X-ray images. The regions on the entire X-ray images with lesions suspected of being due to COVID-19 were simultaneously detected and classified end-to-end via the proposed CAD predictor, achieving overall detection and classification accuracies of 96.31% and 97.40%, respectively. Most test images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases were correctly predicted, achieving average intersection over union (IoU) greater than 90%. Applying deep learning regularizers of data balancing and augmentation improved the COVID-19 diagnostic performance by 6.64% and 12.17% in terms of the overall accuracy and the F1-score, respectively. It is feasible to achieve a diagnosis based on individual chest X-ray images with the proposed CAD system within 0.0093 s. Thus, the CAD system presented in this paper can make a prediction at the rate of 108 frames/s (FPS), which is close to real-time. The proposed deep learning CAD system can reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases. The proposed deep learning model seems to be a reliable tool that can be used to practically assist health care systems, patients, and physicians.","output":"Fast deep learning computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 based on digital chest x-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African region will probably be the last region in COVID-19 vaccine uptake But that shouldn't be a problematic issue if the emphasis is maintained on the role Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) can play in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic through the adoption of preventive measures We used the issue of asymptomatic cases to illustrate the importance that should still be given to preventive measures such as hand washing, mask wearing, physical and social distancing, knowing that vaccines have never been 100% effective Also with the issue of variants in COVID-19, the vaccine couldn't be considered as a panacea Lessons from the Nordic countries are strong arguments to put emphasis on preventive measures in the region","output":"COVID-19 vaccine, asymptomatic cases, risk communication and community engagement in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the widespread of acute respiratory syndrome infection caused by Coronavirus-19, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) was considered a useful imaging tool commonly used in early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with complicated Covid-19 pneumonia.

Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4 weeks later and 8 weeks later.Results: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.Conclusion: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU.

However, since subsequent publication of preprint is not always mentioned in preprint repositories, some may be inappropriately cited or quoted. Our objectives were to assess the reliability of preprint citations in articles on COVID-19, to the rate of publication of preprints cited in these articles and to compare, if relevant, the content of the preprints to their published version. Methods : Articles published on COVID in 2020 in the BMJ, The Lancet, the JAMA and the NEJM were manually screened to identify all articles citing at least one preprint from medRxiv. We searched PubMed, Google and Google Scholar to assess if the preprint had been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and when. Published articles were screened to assess if the title, data or conclusions were identical to the preprint version. Results : Among the 205 research articles on COVID published by the four major medical journals in 2020, 60 (29.3%) cited at least one medRxiv preprint. Among the 182 preprints cited, 124 were published in a peer-reviewed journal, with 51 (41.1%) before the citing article was published online and 73 (58.9%) later. There were differences in the title, the data or the conclusion between the preprint cited and the published version for nearly half of them. MedRxiv did not mentioned the publication for 53 (42.7%) of preprints.

Employing latent class analysis, we revealed three distinct groups of parents with unique compounds of attitudes toward LFH (i.e., disengaged, positive, and negative). Disengaged parents neither consider LFH useful, nor do they see it as demanding. In contrast, the other two groups of parents have quite the opposite views on the usefulness and demandingness of LFH. Further analysis using multinomial logistic regression revealed that older parents from low-income households tend to be disengaged while fathers of young children tend to have negative attitudes toward LFH. Interestingly, the ownership of a personal computer at home seems to be a key indicator of parents with positive attitudes toward LFH after controlling for other demographic factors.

Initially, the speed of spread was slow but later on, its spread rate was very really high and on analysis it turned out to be exponential. Governments all across the world imposed lockdowns, and people were asked to practice social distancing in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Later on, it was announced as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Machine learning-driven methods can prove to be really vital in predicting risks, effects and parameters of this pandemic. These predictions will help in making strategies to control its spread and understand its nature. More research is beginning to anticipate and a remarkable amount of machine learning models are being talked about to predict COVID-19 cases used by experts or researchers around the globe. In this research project, we have used univariate LSTM model to make predictions. The number of confirmed cases, number of recovered cases and the number of death cases in the coming days are being predicted.

Results9,201 death events were reported for COVID-19 vaccine recipients aged five years and older (or age unknown). Reporting rates for death events increased with increasing age, and males generally had higher reporting rates than females. For death events within seven days and 42 days of vaccination, respectively, observed reporting rates were lower than the expected all-cause death rates. Reporting rates for Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were generally higher than for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, but still lower than the expected all-cause death rates.

The ConnectPatientToDoctor study aimed to evaluate a connected telemonitoring platform,Cureety, in cancer patient care. Patients and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the Military Hospital Bgin. Each cancer patient was allowed to respond to a personalized symptomatology questionnaire based on CTCAE v.5.0, and personalized to their pathology and treatment. An algorithm evaluated the health status of the patient based on the reported adverse events and provided adapted recommendations. The calculated score allows to classify the patient into four different levels: (1) Correct State (green) (2) Compromised State (yellow) (3) State to be monitored (orange) (4) Critical State (red) In the case of orange or red classification, the patient was invited to call the hospital. In case of green or yellow classification, the patient received therapeutic advice set by the doctor, for each of the adverse events reported. The primary endpoint was to assess the feasibility of monitoring cancer patient with the connected platform. The secondary endpoint was to assess patient and caregivers' satisfaction. Results: There were 108 patients included in the program between July 1st, 2020 and January 31 , 2021. The median age was 70 and 77% presented a metastatic stage. The most represented cancer was prostate (50%), followed by lung (24%) and breast (15%). Overall, 1864 questionnaires were completed by the patients, resulting in 543 yellow alerts and 133 orange or red alerts.

Piglets inoculated in utero at 92 or 104 gestational days (n = 12) were collected by Caesarean section at term and either sacrificed immediately or kept in isolators and allowed to live postnatally until 35 days postinoculation (PI). Caesarean-derived piglets inoculated at 1 day of age (n = 14) were sacrificed at 10, 21, 35, 42, and 49 days PI. Spleen and lymph nodes were collected for virologic and histopathological examinations. Clinical signs were not observed in any of the piglets. High virus titers (10(4.5-5.7) TCID50/g [TCID refers to tissue culture infectious dose]) were detected in 6 of the 26 piglets. Three of these 6 piglets were euthanized at 10 days PI, and infected cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (SWC3+, CD14+, and sialoadhesin [Sa]+ cells) and infected cells bearing lymphocyte markers (CD4+, CD8+, and immunoglobulin M+ cells) were identified by double-immunofluorescence labeling on serial cryostat sections. The other 3 piglets were euthanized at 21 and 35 days PI, and the majority of infected cells were SWC3+, CD14+, and Sa-. The absence of Sa in these infected cells, together with their localization in lymphocyte-dependent regions, suggests that they were infiltrating monocytic cells. Sialoadhesin is highly expressed in differentiated macrophages and not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In all 6 piglets with high virus titers, lymphocyte depletion and infiltration of monocytic cells were observed. In the remaining 20 piglets with virus titers less than 10(4.5) TCID50/g, the majority of infected cells were SWC3+, CD14+, and Sa+. In conclusion, it can be stated that high PCV2 titers in lymphoid organs may lead to the development of histological lesions similar to those observed in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome without causing disease. Furthermore, in lymphoid organs with high virus titers, infection occurs mainly in infiltrating monocytic cells and to a limited extent in cells bearing lymphocyte markers.","output":"Characteristics of porcine circovirus-2 replication in lymphoid organs of pigs inoculated in late gestation or postnatally and possible relation to clinical and pathological outcome of infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reduced glutathione (GSH) is the main intracellular low molecular weight thiol.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of self-focused AR and vicarious reinforcement on psychological predictors of behavior change during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our study included measures of fear and message minimization to assess potential adverse reactions to the design interventions. METHODS: A between-subjects web-based experiment was conducted to compare the health perceptions of participants in self-focused AR and vicarious reinforcement design conditions to those in a control condition. Participants were randomly assigned to the control group or to an intervention condition (ie, self-focused AR, reinforcement, self-focus AR  reinforcement, and avatar). RESULTS: A total of 335 participants were included in the analysis. We found that participants who experienced self-focused AR and vicarious reinforcement scored higher in perceived threat severity (P=.03) and susceptibility (P=.01) when compared to the control. A significant indirect effect of self-focused AR and vicarious reinforcement on intention was found with perceived threat severity as a mediator (b=.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.12, SE .02). Self-focused AR and vicarious reinforcement did not result in higher levels of fear (P=.32) or message minimization (P=.42) when compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: Augmenting ones reflection with vicarious reinforcement may be an effective strategy for health communication designers. While our studys results did not show adverse effects in regard to fear and message minimization, utilization of self-focused AR as a health communication strategy should be done with care due to the possible adverse effects of heightened levels of fear.","output":"Effects of Self-focused Augmented Reality on Health Perceptions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Between-Subject Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients and healthcare professionals have been concerned that a history of haematological malignancy will lead to an increased risk of severe COVID-19.

Multivariable analysis of large population studies, taking other known risk factors into account, do indicate that patients with haematological malignancy, especially those diagnosed recently, are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 compared to the general population. The evidence that this risk is higher than for those with solid malignancies is conflicting.

A stochastic utility theory is introduced to describe the transfer behavior pertaining to travel modes, and a binary Logit model for diversion transfer is constructed. The decision tree is also used to predict the diversion transfer. Then, based on the large amount of travel willingness data obtained through the stated preference survey, a maximum likelihood estimation method is used to calibrate the parameters of the binary Logit model. The performance of the binary Logit proves to be better than that of the decision tree. Results show that the travel time most notably affects the passenger flow transfer, followed by the vehicle comfort. Finally, Guangzhou Rail Transit Line 3 is considered an example, and the diversion route planning and design are performed according to the constructed diversion transfer probability model to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the model. The research provides an effective theoretical basis and technical reference for other cities to perform rail traffic diversion planning. Based on these results, the following suggestions can be made: (1) the organization of public transportation routes, delivery volume, and travel speed outside should be improved;(2) undertaking combined operation of bus and rail transportation and integrated development is preferred;(3) the transportation management should focus on the comprehensive function development and hardware support of public transportation stations.

This study aimed at quantifying the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown in France on nuclear medicine examination volume together with volume of examination cancellation and non-attendance. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the volume of planned examinations from 1 month before to 1 month after the first lockdown in French high-volume nuclear medicine departments (NMD) sharing the same information management system including both university hospitals, UH (n = 7), and cancer centres, CC (n = 2). RESULTS: The study enrolled 31,628 consecutive patients referred for a nuclear medicine examination performed or not (NMEP or NMEnP). The total volume of NMEP significantly dropped by 43.4% between the 4 weeks before and after the starting of the lockdown. The comparison of the percentage of NMEP and NMEnP between UH and CC is significantly different (p < 0.001). The percentage of NMEP during the study was 67.9% in UH vs 84.7% in CC. Percentages of NMEnP in UH and CC were due respectively to cancellation by the patient (14.9 vs 7.4%), cancellation by the NMD (9.5 vs 3.4%), cancellation by the referring physician (5.1 vs 4.4%) and non-attender patients (2.7 vs 0.2%).

The attachment of the virus with the cell-surface receptor and a co-factor is the first step for the infection. Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those as bound to the MERS-CoV-S. Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S. This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis, and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.","output":"The MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 as a candidate binding target of the SARS-CoV-2 spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Se?or editor: El exceso de muertes debido a la COVID-19 en Per durante el 2020fueunodelosmselevadosdelmundo,esto probablemente favorecido por la fragilidad del sistema salud y los determinantes sociales de este pas.

The 7MS consists of four subtests (Temporal Orientation, Enhanced Cued Recall, Clock Drawing, and Verbal Fluency), each measuring a different aspect of cognition. The present study is designed to examine the predictive validity of the 7MS to distinguish between patients with early-stage AD and healthy control subjects. METHODS Sixty-three patients who were diagnosed as having probable or possible AD and 91 community-dwelling elderly individuals of comparable age, sex distribution, and education were administered the 7MS (paper-and-pencil version) and other screening batteries. All patients were rated Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 0.5-1, categorized as early-stage AD, and all participants obtained a score of less than 6 for the Geriatric Depression Scale (15-item version). RESULTS Mean scores for patients and controls on all the four subtests were significantly different. When using the total score of the 7MS, which was calculated by the original logistic regression formula based on all of the four subtests, the sensitivity for early-stage AD was 90.5% with a specificity of 92.3%. Correlation analysis indicated high concurrent validity between the 7MS and existing standard cognitive screening batteries (e.g., MMSE, HDS-R). In correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, demographic effects (age, sex, and education) were not significantly associated with the total score of the 7MS in controls. CONCLUSIONS The results showed that the 7MS had a high level of sensitivity and specificity. We also found that the 7MS was not affected by demographic characteristics.

Given the unique characteristics of the dental setting, the risk of cross-infection between dental practitioners and patients is high in the absence of adequate protective measures, and dentists may develop severe anxiety in relation to the current pandemic. The limited provision of services and widespread closure of dental practices have raised concerns among dental professionals about the financial impact. The present study assessed the frequency of dental practice closure during the pandemic's first wave in several countries and whether closures and their associated factors differ between the private and non-private sectors. METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional survey questionnaire was sent to dentists in several countries, from April to May 2020. The survey assessed professional, practice related and country-level structural factors elucidating the reason for practice closure. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association between practice closure and these factors, and differences were evaluated by sector type. RESULTS: Dentists from 29 countries (n = 3243) participated in this study. Most of the participants (75.9%) reported practice closure with significantly higher percentage in the private sector than the non-private sector. Greater pandemic-related fears were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of practice closure in the private (odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 1.92) and non-private (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04, 1.82) sectors. Dentists in non-private rural areas (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.81), and those in hospitals (overall OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.36, 0.99) reported a low likelihood of closure. A high likelihood of closure was reported by dentists in the academia (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.23, 3.71). More hospital beds at the country-level were associated with a lower likelihood of closure in the non-private sector (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46, 0.91). Private- sector dentists in high- income countries (HICs) reported fewer closures than those in non-HICs (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.15, 1.93).

Methods: In this prospective, longitudinal, descriptive cohort study, we will observe participants with symptoms related to COVID-19 who consent to participate in telehealth visits and receive individualized CHM. All participants are asked to obtain a COVID-19 test. Licensed practitioners with at least 20 years' CHM practice experience will determine the number of telehealth consultations necessary for each participant. All participants are prescribed individualized CHM dispensed either as raw herbs to be decocted at home or granules. Follow-up at 24- and 48-hours after each telehealth visit will provide clinicians with information to determine if an additional telehealth consultation is necessary. Follow-up is at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The study is registered ClinicalTrials.gov and currently enrolling. Fifty-six participants have enrolled to date: 35 (63%) are female and 21 (37%) male;45.83 average age (range 22-69). In total, 191 consultations were administered with an average of 3.35 per participant (range 1-9).

We believe that feco-oral transmission could occur if community transmission becomes high and sustained in densely populated cities without proper sanitation in Nigeria and many other African and Asian settings. In the absence of basic sanitation, or where existing sanitation is not safely managed, groundwater, which is often drawn up from wells and boreholes for drinking and household use, can become contaminated with enteric bacteria and viruses from fecal matter. Endemic and epidemic transmission of multiple feco-oral pathogens via this route continues to be documented in areas without safely managed sanitation, and, therefore, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be evaluated, tracked, and forestalled in such settings. We suggest that fecal matter from treatment facilities and recovered patients should be carefully and properly disposed.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy (e.g., anti-PD-1 therapy) has opened a new horizon in melanoma treatment, but some patients present a non-responsive state. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) make up the majority of stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have an important impact on the response to immunotherapy. There is still a lack of identification of CAFs-related predictors for anti-PD-1 therapy, although the establishment of immunotherapy biomarkers is well underway. This study aims to explore the potential CAFs-related gene panel for predicting the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients and elucidating their potential effect on TME. Methods: Three gene expression datasets from melanoma patients without anti-PD-1 treatment, in a total of 87 samples, were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as the discovery sets (GSE91061) and validation sets (GSE78220 and GSE122220). The CAFs-related module genes were identified from the discovery sets by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Concurrently, we utilized differential gene analysis on the discovery set to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, CAFs-related key genes were screened with the intersection of CAFs-related module genes and DEGs, succeeded by supervised machine learning-based identification. As a consequence of expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, survival analysis, staging analysis, TME analysis, and correlation analysis, the multidimensional systematic characterizations of the key genes were uncovered. The diagnostic performance of the CAFs-related gene panel was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in the validation sets. Eventually, the CAFs-related gene panel was verified by the expression from the single-cell analysis. Results: The six-gene panel associated with CAFs were finally identified for predicting the response to anti-PD-1 therapy, including CDK14, SYNPO2, TCF4, GJA1, CPXM1, and TFPI. The multigene panel demonstrated excellent combined diagnostic performance with the area under the curve of ROC reaching 90.5 and 75.4% ~100% in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. Conclusion: Confirmed by clinical treatment outcomes, the identified CAFs-related genes can be used as a promising biomarker panel for prediction to anti-PD-1 therapy response, which may serve as new immunotherapeutic targets to improve survival outcomes of melanoma patients.","output":"A Cancer Associated Fibroblasts-Related Six-Gene Panel for Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Melanoma Driven by Weighted Correlation Network Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimating the longevity of an individual's immune response to the Sars-Cov-2 virus is vital for future planning, particularly of vaccine requirements.

Studies use different assays to measure Nabs making them hard to combine. We present a modelling method which can combine multiple datasets and can be updated as more detailed data becomes available. Combining data from six published datasets we predict that after a short period of rapid decay the half-life of the NAb response is approximately one year giving optimism that the response will be long-lived.","output":"Estimating decay curves of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS: Brazil has suffered two waves of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The second wave, coinciding with the spread of the Gamma variant, was more severe than the first wave. Studies have not yet reached a conclusion on some issues including the extent of reinfection, the infection fatality rate (IFR), the infection attack rate (IAR) and the effects of the vaccination campaign in Brazil, though it was reported that confirmed reinfection was at a low level. METHODS: We modify the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model with additional class for severe cases, vaccination and time-varying transmission rates. We fit the model to the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) deaths, which is a proxy of the COVID-19 deaths, in 20 Brazilian cities with the large number of death tolls. We evaluate the vaccination effect by a contrast of \\"with\\" vaccination actual scenario and \\"without\\" vaccination in a counterfactual scenario. We evaluate the model performance when the reinfection is absent in the model. RESULTS: In the 20 Brazilian cities, the model simulated death matched the reported deaths reasonably well. The effect of the vaccination varies across cities. The estimated median IFR is around 1.2%. CONCLUSION: Overall, through this modeling exercise, we conclude that the effects of vaccination campaigns vary across cites and the reinfection is not crucial for the second wave. The relatively high IFR could be due to the breakdown of medical system in many cities.","output":"Two waves of COIVD-19 in Brazilian cities and vaccination impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has posed formidable challenges for clinical laboratories seeking reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. METHODS: The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged &#8805;18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low.

METHODS An anonymous online survey was administrated to professional dental students that focused on their experiences related to COVID-19. The survey included questions about student demographics, protocols for school reopening and student perceptions of institutional responses, student concerns, and psychological impacts. RESULTS Among the 145 respondents, 92.4% were pre-doctoral dental students and 7.6% were orthodontic residents; 48.2% were female and 12.6% students lived alone during the school closure due to the pandemic. Students' age ranged from 23 to 39 years. Younger students expressed more concerns about their emotional health (P = 0.01). In terms of the school's overall response to COVID-19, 73.1% students thought it was effective. The majority (83%) of students believed that social distancing in school can minimize the development of COVID-19. In general, students felt that clinical education suffered after transitioning to online but responded more positively about adjustments to other online curricular components.

There is some disagreement among expert organizations on an optimal approach based on resource availability, surge volume, and potential risk of transmission. The manuscript outlines the precautions and steps to be taken before, during, and after resuscitation of a newborn born to a COVID-19 mother, including three optional variations of current standards involving shared-decision making with parents for perinatal management, resuscitation of the newborn, disposition, nutrition, and postdischarge care. The availability of resources may also drive the application of these guidelines. More evidence and research are needed to assess the risk of vertical and horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on fetal and neonatal outcomes. KEY POINTS:  The risk of vertical transmission is unclear; transmission from family members/providers to neonates is possible..  Optimal personal-protective-equipment (airborne vs. droplet/contact precautions) for providers is crucial to prevent transmission..  Parents should be engaged in shared decision-making with options for rooming in, skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding..","output":"Neonatal Resuscitation and Postresuscitation Care of Infants Born to Mothers with Suspected or Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on the effective burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in pediatric population are very limited, mostly because of the higher rate of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases among children. Updated data on COVID-19 prevalence are needed for their relevance in public health and for infection control policies. In this single-centre cross-sectional study we aimed to assess prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through IgG antibodies detection in an Italian pediatric cohort. METHODS: The study was conducted in January 2021 among both inpatients and outpatients referring to Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health \\"Burlo Garofolo\\" in Trieste, Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Italy, who needed for blood test for any reason. Collected samples were sent to Italian National Institute of Health for analysis through chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). RESULTS: One hundred sixty-nine patients were included in the study, with a median age of 10.5  4.1 years, an equal distribution for sex (49.7% female patients), and a 55.6% prevalence of comorbidities. Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike protein IgG antibodies was 9.5% (n = 16), with a medium titre of 482.3  387.1 BAU/mL. Having an infected cohabitant strongly correlated with IgG positivity (OR 23.83, 95% CI 7.19-78.98, p < 0.0001), while a cohabitant healthcare worker wasn't associated with a higher risk (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.4-5.86, p 0.46). All of the 5 patients who had previously tested positive to a nasopharyngeal swab belonged to the IgG positive group, with a 3-month interval from the infection at most. CONCLUSION: We assessed a 9.5% SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a pediatric cohort from Friuli Venezia-Giulia region in January 2021, showing a substantial increase after the second peak of the pandemic occurred starting from October 2020, compared to 1% prevalence observed by National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) in July 2020.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian pediatric population: a regional seroepidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has revolutionized the education system and forced fundamental changes in the teaching?learning process.

We aimed to derive and validate a scoring system to diagnose AEP without bronchoscopy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including patients diagnosed with AEP or any other pneumonia among military smokers hospitalized in the Armed Forces Capital Hospital from 15 November 2016 through 25 December 2019. The patients were divided into derivation and validation groups according to their admission day. Patient symptoms, laboratory findings, and computed tomography findings were candidate variables. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to calculate the scores for each variable. RESULTS: Among 414 patients, AEP was confirmed in 54 of 279 patients (19.4%) in the derivation group and in 18 of 135 patients (13.3%) in the validation group. Ten variables were selected using LASSO regression: new-onset or a recently increased smoking ( 4 weeks) (8 points), interlobular septal thickening (5 points), absence of sputum (3 points), ground glass opacity (3 points), acute onset ( 3 days) (2 points), dyspnea (2 points), chest pain (2 points), leukocytosis (2 points), bronchovascular bundle thickening (2 points), and bilateral involvement (2 points). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the score to diagnose AEP was 0.997 (95% confidence interval, 0.992 to 1.000) in the derivation group and 0.985 (95% confidence interval, 0.965 to 1.000) in the validation group.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown on this population through the lens of users of the UK National Health Service-approved pregnancy and parenting smartphone app, Baby Buddy. The study aims were threefold: to gain insights into the attitudes and experiences of expectant and recent parents (with babies under 24 weeks of age) during the COVID-19 pandemic; to investigate whether Baby Buddy is meeting users' needs during this time; and to identify ways to revise the content of Baby Buddy to better support its users now and in future. METHODS: A mixed methods study design combining a web-based survey with semistructured telephone interviews among Baby Buddy users in the United Kingdom was applied. Data were collected from April 15 to mid-June 2020, corresponding to weeks 4-13 of the lockdown in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 436 expectant (n=244, 56.0%) and recent (n=192, 44.0%) parents responded to the web-based survey, of which 79.1% (n=345) were aged 25-39 years and 17.2% (n=75) spoke English as their second language. Of the 436 respondents, 88.5% (386/436) reported increased levels of anxiety around pregnancy, birth, and being a new parent, and 58.0% (253/436) were concerned about their emotional and mental health. Of the 244 pregnant respondents, 43.4% (n=106) were concerned about their physical health. Telephone interviews with 13 pregnant women and 19 recent parents revealed similarly increased levels of anxiety due to reduced health care provision and loss of support from friends and family. Although a minority of respondents identified some positive outcomes of lockdown, such as family bonding, many telephone interviewees reported feeling isolated, disregarded, and overwhelmed. Recent parents were particularly anxious about the impact of the lockdown on their baby's development and socialization. Many interviewees were also concerned about their physical health as a consequence of both limited access to face-to-face medical appointments and their own poorer dietary and physical activity behaviors. Across both samples, 97.0% (423/436) of respondents reported that Baby Buddy was currently helping them, with many commenting that its role was even more important given the lack of face-to-face support from health care and parenting organizations. Greater speed in updating digital content to reflect changes due to the pandemic was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened anxiety and stress among expectant parents and those with a young baby, and for many, lockdown has had an adverse impact on their physical and mental well-being. With reductions in health care and social support, expectant and new parents are increasingly relying on web-based resources. As a free, evidence-based app, Baby Buddy is well positioned to meet this need. The app could support its users even more by actively directing them to the wealth of existing content relevant to their concerns and by adding content to give users the knowledge and confidence to meet new challenges.","output":"Experiences, Attitudes, and Needs of Users of a Pregnancy and Parenting App (Baby Buddy) During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal models to study opiates are of growing interest.

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Controlled, clinical, English-language studies exploring the diagnostic and monitoring value of VOCs in asthma, COPD, CF, lung cancer and respiratory tract infections were included.

METHODS Review of publicly available public health and academic hospitals guidelines along with review of communication among otolaryngology departments. RESULTS Among 114 academic institutions affiliated with OHNS residencies, 20 (17.5%) institutions provided public access to some form of guidance on PPE and 73 (64%) provided information on screening or diagnostic testing. PPE guidelines were uniquely described based on several variables: location of care, COVID-19 status, involvement of aerosol generating or high-risk procedures, and physical distance from the patient. Six hospital guidelines were highlighted. Across these 6 institutions, there was agreement that N95 respirators were needed for high-risk patients undergoing high-risk procedures. Variations existed amongst institutions for scenarios with low-risk patients. Definitions of the low-risk patient and high-risk procedures were inconsistent amongst institutions. Three of the highlighted institutions had OHNS departments recommending higher level of airway protection than the institution. CONCLUSION OHNS departments typically had more stringent PPE guidance than their institution.

The integrated HIV-interventions, launched in early 2012, managed to reduce directly the HIV incidence and indirectly the HCV incidence. This study aims to assess what would have been the course of the HIV outbreak and its associated economic consequences if the 2009 HCV outbreak had been detected and integrated interventions had been initiated 1- or 2-years earlier. METHODS: The model was calibrated to reproduce the observed HIV epidemiological and clinical parameters among PWID of Athens, Greece. We examined the effect of the 1- or 2-years earlier detection scenarios, the 1-year later detection, the non-detection scenario, and compared them to the status quo scenario. RESULTS: Cumulative HIV cases, under the status-quo scenario during 2009\\\\2019, were 1360 (90% Credible intervals: 290, 2470). If the HCV outbreak had been detected 1- or 2- years earlier, with immediate initiation of integrated interventions, 740 and 1110 HIV cases could be averted by 2019, respectively. Regarding the costs, if there was an efficient notification system to detect the HCV outbreak 1 or 2 years earlier, 35.2C53.2 million euros could be saved compared to the status quo by 2019.

Unlike human influenza vaccines, strains used for commercially available swine influenza vaccines are not regularly replaced, making the vaccines provide limited protection against antigenically diverse viruses. It is therefore necessary to develop broadly protective swine influenza vaccines that are efficacious to both homologous and heterologous virus infections. In this study, two forms of DNA vaccines were constructed, one was made by fusing M2e to consensus H3HA (MHa), which represents the majority of the HA sequences of H3N2 swine influenza viruses. Another was made by fusing M2e and a conserved CTL epitope (NP147-155) to consensus H3HA (MNHa). Their protective efficacies against homologous and heterologous challenges were tested. RESULTS: BALB/c mice were immunized twice by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) with the two DNA vaccines. It was shown that the two vaccines elicited substantial antibody responses, and MNHa induced more significant T cell-mediated immune response than MHa did. Then two H3N2 strains representative of different evolutional and antigenic clusters were used to challenge the vaccine-immunized mice (homosubtypic challenge). Results indicated that both of the DNA vaccines prevented homosubtypic virus infections completely. The vaccines heterologous protective efficacies were further tested by challenging with a H1N1 swine influenza virus and a reassortant 2009 pandemic strain. It was found that MNHa reduced the lung viral titers significantly in both challenge groups, histopathological observation showed obvious reduction of lung pathogenesis as compared to MHa and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The combined utility of the consensus HA and the conserved M2e and CTL epitope can confer complete and partial protection against homologous and heterologous challenges, respectively, in mouse model.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the recent epidemiological trend of pulmonary TB (PTB) in mainland China based on the national surveillance data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study collected demographic and clinical data of all patients reported in the national Tuberculosis Information Management System of China from January 1, 2005, to November 21, 2016. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. EXPOSURES: Pulmonary TB was defined as bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed TB in the lung parenchyma or the tracheobronchial tree. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal and spatial variation of annual incidence and demographic features of PTB in mainland China. RESULTS: In total, 10 582 903 patients with PTB were reported in mainland China from 2005 to 2016. The median age of patients with PTB was 46 (interquartile range [IQR], 30-61) years, and 28.53% were 60 years or older. Most patients with PTB were male (69.8%) and farmers or herders (70.0%). The mean (SD) incidence of PTB was 66.61 (8.09) per 100 000 population. The annual incidence decreased from 72.95 per 100 000 population in 2005 to 52.18 per 100 000 population in 2016, and the reduction was greater in the eastern and central regions (31.6%; from 69.43 to 47.48 per 100 000 population) than in the western region (21.0%; from 82.06 to 64.82 per 100 000 population). Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (135.03 per 100 000 population), Guizhou Province (115.98 per 100 000 population), and the Tibet Autonomous Region (101.98 per 100 000 population) had the highest mean annual incidences. The median time from onset of illness to diagnosis decreased from 36 (IQR, 16-92) days from 2005 to 2007 to 31 (IQR, 15-63) days in 2008 and later (P < .001) and was longer in the western region than in the eastern and central regions (41 [IQR, 20-91] vs 30 [IQR, 13-61] days; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although this study found that the incidence of PTB in mainland China showed a downward trend from 2005 to 2016, to achieve the World Health Organization 2035 goal, innovative and more efficient prevention and control strategies are needed, particularly among the most susceptible population, that is, farmers and herders in western China.","output":"Changes in Incidence and Epidemiological Characteristics of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Mainland China, 2005-2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: Food insecurity (FI) is the worry or inability of families to obtain enough food for everyone. FI is associated with worse health outcomes in children. While research on FI focuses on non-hospitalized children, the prevalence of FI in hospitalized children has been reported to be as high as 25%. There is little known about FI in critically ill children. We hypothesize that given the association of FI and worse health outcomes, there may be a higher prevalence of FI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The goal of this study is to characterize the prevalence of FI in the PICU. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of families admitted to an urban, quaternary care PICU during four-week enrollment periods in Fall 2020, Winter 2021, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021. English-speaking families of children under 18 years who had an unplanned admission to the PICU were approached for enrollment. Participants completed a brief survey including the USDA 18-item Food Security Supplement to explore depth of FI. RESULTS: 272 families were enrolled. 78 (28.7%) in the Fall, 68 (25%) in the Winter, 72 (26.5%) and 54 (19.9%) in the Summer. 47.7% (130) families self-identified as Black, 25% (68) White, 8.8% (24) Hispanic, 4.8% (13) Asian, 11% (30) multi-racial. Overall, 213 families (78.3%) were food secure and 59 families (21.7%) were food insecure. Of the food secure families, 32 (15%) experienced marginal food security. Of families experiencing FI, 35 (59.3%) had children experiencing child-level FI, 7 (12%) had children experiencing very low food security among children, and 24 (40.7%) experienced very low household food security. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing prevalence and severity of FI in critically ill children. In 2019, only 13.6% of households with children reported FI and only 0.6% of households reported very low food security among children. While data on FI during the COVID-19 pandemic is pending, our study suggests that FI in our PICU may be higher than that of the general population and is similar to rates reported in hospitalized children. Notably, our data shows that over half of families experiencing FI experience child-level FI, and that the prevalence of very low food security in our population is higher than previously reported in the general population.","output":"Food insecurity in the pediatric intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynamic X-ray (DXR) is a functional imaging technique that uses sequential images obtained by a flat-panel detector (FPD).

Persistent symptoms have recently emerged as a clinical issue in COVID-19. We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors in symptomatic non-hospitalized individuals with mild COVID-19. Methods. We performed a prospective cohort study of symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients, from March to May 2020, with weekly phone calls from clinical onset until day 30 and up to day 60 in case of persistent symptoms. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients with complete recovery at day 30 and day 60 and factors associated with persistent symptoms. Results. We enrolled 429 individuals mostly women (72.5%) and healthcare workers (72.5%), with a median age of 41.6 years [IQR 30-51.5]. Symptoms included: cough (69.7%), asthenia (68.8%), anosmia (64.8%), headaches (64.6%), myalgia (62.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (61.8%), fever (61.5%), and ageusia (60.8%). Mean duration of disease was 27 days (95%CI: 25-29). The rate of persistent symptoms was 46.8% at day 30 and 6.5% at day 60 consisting in asthenia (32.6%), anosmia (32.6%), and ageusia (30.4%). The probability of complete recovery was 56.3% (95%CI: 51.7-61.1) at day 30 and 85.6% (95%CI: 81.2-89.4) at day 60. Factors associated with persistent symptoms were age >40 (HR 0.61), female sex (HR 0.70), low cycle threshold (HR 0.78), and ageusia (HR 0.59). Conclusions. COVID-19 even in its mild presentation led to persistent symptoms (up to one month) in nearly half of individuals. Identification of risk factors such as age, gender, ageusia and viral load is crucial for clinical management and argues for the development of antiviral agents.","output":"Prevalence and factors associated with symptom persistence: a prospective study of 429 mild COVID-19 outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) METHODS: Plasma of 200-400 mL was collected from convalescent patients 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion RESULTS: (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31 25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68 75%) were critical COVID-19;62 50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease;the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90 91% (10/11) and 45 46% (5/11) respectively (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10 93 kAU/L to 114 7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56 44+/-39 40) kAU/L NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs 5 (3-8), P = 0 036] Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0 81+/-0 28 vs 1 00) and NEU (0 75+/-0 33 vs 1 00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P &lt; 0 05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0 017) No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion CONCLUSIONS: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion Detection and screening convalescent plasma of high-titer antibody and early application to severe and critical patients are expected to improve the efficacy of convalescent plasma","output":"[Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 patients]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at risk of occupational infections, and some procedures are known to increase this risk.

Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. RESULTS: A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study.

METHODS: A multi\\\\item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites in the last week of May 2020 to recruit adult Americans in the general population across the United States. RESULTS: Among the total sample of study participants (n = 1432), almost a fifth (18%, n = 263) reported buying a firearm during the pandemic. Firearm buyers differed statistically significantly (P < 0.01) from non\\\\buyers based on sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, education, having children at home, employment status, income, political orientation, location, and region of residence in the United States. Those who did not buy firearms during the pandemic were significantly (P < 0.01) more likely to believe that firearm sales and first\\\\time ownership/buying of firearms had increased during the pandemic. Similarly, those who did not buy a firearm during the pandemic were significantly more likely to believe that the surge in firearm sales would result in increased firearm access for children, mentally ill, drug users, criminals, and older adults. In relation to perceived changes in selected public health outcomes attributed to the surge in firearm sales, firearm buyers were significantly less likely (P < 0.01) to believe that an increase in sales could result in adverse public health outcomes such as a higher number of suicides, homicides, mass shootings, and crimes in society. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of pandemic purchase of firearms were: having children at home, owning firearms before the pandemic, planning to buy firearms in the next year, knowing someone who was shot or killed with a firearm, and personally experiencing firearm violence in the past (ie, threatened or shot with a firearm).

Beyond the summary of recent advances in FNA-based sensors for COVID-19 diagnostics, our goal is to outline how FNA might serve to overcome the scientific barriers that currently available diagnostic approaches are suffering. The first introductory section on the operationalization of the COVID-19 pandemic in historical view and its clinical features contextualizes essential SARS-CoV-2-specific biomarkers. The second part highlights three major scientific barriers for POC COVID-19 diagnosis, that is, the lack of a general method for (1) designing receptors of SARS-CoV-2 variants; (2) improving sensitivity to overcome false negatives; and (3) signal readout in resource-limited settings. The subsequent part provides fundamental insights into FNA and technical tricks to successfully achieve effective COVID-19 diagnosis by using in vitro selection of FNA to overcome receptor design barriers, combining FNA with multiple DNA signal amplification strategies to improve sensitivity, and interfacing FNA with portable analyzers to overcome signal readout barriers.

Treatment changes can negatively affect patients' prognosis and may be psychologically burdensome. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether COVID-19-related treatment changes (delays, cancellations, changes) influenced fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety, and depression in breast cancer patients. METHODS: A convenience sample (n = 154) of patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer no longer than 2 years ago was obtained from an online community and social network site. The survey content included COVID-19-related treatment experiences and psychological status. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, &#967;2 test, independent t test, and analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (18.8%) had experienced COVID-19-related treatment changes, and changes of the treatment plan had a significant correlation with depression (t = 2.000, P = .047). Fear of cancer recurrence was high (mean score, 84.31  24.23). Fifteen percent had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, and 24.7% had moderate to severe levels of depression. Narrative reports also identified COVID-19-related unforeseen costs. CONCLUSION: In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer patients experienced treatment changes, and changes in treatment plans were significantly associated with depression. Fear of recurrence, anxiety, and depression were found at high levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology nurses should assess the psychological status of cancer patients in the early survivorship phase who appear to be especially vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oncology nurses can also monitor whether patients are receiving timely supportive care to alleviate fears and anxiety and assess financial needs for COVID-19-related costs.","output":"Do COVID-19-Related Treatment Changes Influence Fear of Cancer Recurrence, Anxiety, and Depression in Breast Cancer Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are over 80,000 people imprisoned in England and Wales in 117 prisons. The management of the COVID-19 pandemic presents particular challenges in this setting where confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated conditions facilitate the rapid spread of infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 in Prison Study aims to examine the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in prisons in England in order to inform public health policy and practice during the pandemic and recovery. The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of positive tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff within selected prisons. The secondary objectives include estimating the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and examining how the proportion of positive tests and the incidence rate vary among individual, institutional, and system level factors. METHODS: Phase 1 comprises a repeated panel survey of prison residents and staff in a representative sample of 28 prisons across England. All residents and staff in the study prisons are eligible for inclusion. Participants will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab twice (6 weeks apart). Staff will also be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Phase 2 focuses on SARS-CoV-2 infection in prisons with recognized COVID-19 outbreaks. Any prison in England will be eligible to participate if an outbreak is declared. In 3 outbreak prisons, all participating staff and residents will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the following 3 timepoints: as soon as possible after the outbreak is declared (day 0), 7 days later (day 7), and at day 28. They will be swabbed twice (a nasal swab for lateral flow device testing and a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction testing). Testing will be done by external contractors. Data will also be collected on individual, prison level, and community factors. Data will be stored and handled at the University of Southampton and Public Health England. Summary statistics will summarize the prison and participant characteristics. For the primary objective, simple proportions of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and incidence rates will be calculated. Linear regression will examine the individual, institutional, system, and community factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection within prisons. RESULTS: The UK Governments Department for Health and Social Care funds the study. Data collection started on July 20, 2020, and will end on May 31, 2021. As of May 2021, we had enrolled 4192 staff members and 6496 imprisoned people in the study. Data analysis has started, and we expect to publish the initial findings in summer/autumn 2021.

We found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic factors played a more important role than app design choices such as decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas). Our mediation analysis showed that one's perception of the public health benefits offered by the app and the adoption willingness of other people had a larger effect in explaining the observed effects of app design choices and individual differences than one's perception of the app's security and privacy risks.

In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation (DA) method with two components to address these problems. The first component is a stochastic class-balanced boosting sampling strategy that overcomes the imbalanced learning problem and improves the classification performance on poorly-predicted classes. The second component is a representation learning that guarantees three properties: 1) domain-transferability by prototype triplet loss, 2) discriminant by conditional maximum mean discrepancy loss, and 3) completeness by multi-view reconstruction loss. Particularly, we propose a domain translator and align the heterogeneous data to the estimated class prototypes (i.e., class centers) in a hyper-sphere manifold.

Fusion of both cell types was observed 12 to 18 h after infection when trypsin was present in the medium. Fusion was not observed in infected BFB cell cultures and was rarely observed 48 h after infection of BFTy cells maintained with the trypsin-free medium. The largest polycaryons formed had 15 to 22 nuclei. They then lysed and detached. Cell fusion depended on de novo synthesis of hemagglutinin and infectivity. Fusion from without was not observed. Virus produced under trypsin-enhancing conditions accompanied by cell fusion did not lyse mouse erythrocytes that reacted with L9 coronavirus hemagglutinin. Trypsin-treated, infected BFTy cultures produced coronaviral particles that excluded stain from the envelope confinement.

We first quantified the heterogeneity of viral dynamics which could be a confounder in compassionate use programs. Second, we demonstrated that an antiviral drug is unlikely to be effective if initiated after a short period following symptom onset.

Hence, it has emerged as an attractive antiviral drug-target. In this study, computational approaches were employed, mainly the structure-based virtual screening coupled with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to computationally identify specific inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PLpro, that can be further developed as potential pan-PLpro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The sequence, structure, and functional conserveness of most deadly human CoVs PLpro were exploited, and it was revealed that functionally important catalytic triad residues are well conserved among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The subsequent screening of a focused protease inhibitors database composed of a??7000 compounds resulted in the identification of three candidate compounds, ADM_13083841, LMG_15521745, and SYN_15517940. These three compounds established conserved interactions which were further explored through MD simulations, free energy calculations, and residual energy contribution estimated by MM-PB(GB)SA method. All these compounds showed stable conformation and interacted well with the active residues of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and showed consistent interaction profile with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro as well. Conclusively, the reported SARS-CoV-2 PLpro specific compounds could serve as seeds for developing potent pan-PLpro based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against deadly human coronaviruses. Moreover, the presented information related to binding site residual energy contribution could lead to further optimization of these compounds.","output":"Discovery of human coronaviruses pan-papain-like protease inhibitors using computational approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The social construct of masculinity evolves in response to changes in society and culture. Orthodox masculinity is mostly considered to be hegemonic and is evidenced by the dominance of men over women and other, less powerful men. Contemporary shifts in masculinity have seen an emergence of new masculinities that challenge traditional male stereotypes. This systematic review aims to review and synthesize the existing empirical research on contemporary masculinities and to conceptualize how they are understood and interpreted by men themselves. A literature search was undertaken on 10 databases using terms regularly used to identify various contemporary masculinities. Analysis of the 33 included studies identified four key elements that are evident in men's descriptions of contemporary masculinity. These four elements, (a) Inclusivity, (b) Emotional Intimacy, (c) Physicality, and (d) Resistance, are consistent with the literature describing contemporary masculinities, including Hybrid Masculinities and Inclusive Masculinity Theory. The synthesized findings indicate that young, middle-class, heterosexual men in Western cultures, while still demonstrating some traditional masculinity norms, appear to be adopting some aspects of contemporary masculinities.

Data of 433 participants were collected and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that procrastination is negatively related to 6 sub-constructs of self-regulated online learning: task strategy, mood adjustment, self-evaluation, environmental structure, time management, and help-seeking. These sub-constructs were negatively related to the learners' perceived ineffectiveness of online learning. However, the relationship between perceived learning ineffectiveness and environmental structure or help-seeking was weaker than that with task strategy or mood adjustment, indicating that the latter two subtypes of self-regulated online learning should be considered before students engage in online learning.","output":"Procrastination predicts online self-regulated learning and online learning ineffectiveness during the coronavirus lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This study was aimed at assessing the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of Covishield, which is identical to the AstraZeneca vaccine, in preventing laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.

The cases and controls were matched for age ({+/-} 3 years) and date of testing ({+/-} 3 days). The groups were compared using multivariable conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR), with adjustment for gender, occupational role, presence of symptoms and presence of a comorbidity condition. Per cent vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 100x(1-adjusted odds ratio). Results: Using data from 360 case-control pairs, VE of one dose and of two doses, in providing protection against Covid-19 was 49% (95% CI: 17%-68%) and 54% (27%-71%), respectively. In view of a difference in the proportion of cases and controls who had symptoms, a separate analysis of data from 203 pairs where both the case and the control had symptoms was done, which showed, VE of 58% (28%-75%) and 64% (38%-78%) after one dose and two doses, respectively. Among cases with moderately severe disease that required oxygen therapy, VE following any number of vaccine doses was 95% (44%-100%).

Early intervention in aortovascular disease is often critical and cannot be deferred despite these reductions. There is urgent need to evaluate the provision and outcomes of thoracic aortovascular intervention during the peak of the pandemic. METHODS: Prospective data was collected for patients receiving open and endovascular thoracic aortovascular intervention over two-time points; January-May 2020 and January-May 2019 at three tertiary cardiovascular centres. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk and COVID-19 screening results were noted. Primary outcomes were median length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, intra-operative mortality, 30-day mortality, post-operative stroke, and spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Patients operated in 2020 (41) had significantly higher median EuroSCORE II than 2019 (53) (7.44 vs. 5.86, P = 0.032) and rates of previous cardiac (19.5% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.019), aortic (14.6% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.041), and endovascular (22.0% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.009) intervention. There was an increase in proportion of urgent cases in 2020 (31.7% vs. 18.9%). There were no intra-operative deaths in 2020 and 1 in 2019 (P = 1.00).

METHODS: Surveys that were in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act were deployed online to patients and physicians. RESULTS: We collected survey responses from 400 patients and 197 pediatric nephrologists. Patients reported positive experiences with telemedicine visits as it was logistically easier than in-person visits. Patients also felt that the quality of their visits were equivalent to what they would receive in person. Physicians used a wide variety of online systems to conduct synchronous telemedicine with Zoom (23%), EPIC (9%), Doxy.me (7%), services not specified (37%), or a mix of local or smaller services (24%). Most physicians' concerns were related to technological issues and the ability to procure physical exams and/or laboratory results.

METHODS: Single-center chart review comparing characteristics of children with MIS-C and severe/critical COVID-19 infection. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to create predictive models for predicting MIS-C. RESULTS: Of 68 patients, 28 (41.2%) had MIS-C while 40 (58.8%) had severe/critical COVID-19 infection. MIS-C patients had a higher prevalence of fever, mucocutaneous, cardiac and gastrointestinal involvement and a lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms (P<0.05). Significantly lower hemoglobin, platelet count, serum electrolytes, and significantly elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers were observed in MIS-C cohort. Upon multivariate logistic regression, the best model included C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet count, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneus involvement and absence of respiratory involvement (performance of 0.94). CRP>40 mg/L with either platelet count <15010(9) or mucocutaneous involvement had specificity of 97.5% to diagnose MIS-C.

The types of infections that occur in PIDD patients are largely dictated by the nature of the immune deficiency, which can be defined by dysfunction of cellular or humoral defenses. An increasing number of PIDDs, including those with both cellular and humoral defects, have antibody deficiency as a major feature and can benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy as a result. In fact, the most common PIDDs worldwide are antibody deficiencies and include common variable immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper IgM syndrome, specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of these conditions, a thorough understanding of the specific infections for which these patients are at increased risk can hasten diagnosis and guide additional therapies. Moreover, the infection trends in some PIDD patients with profound defects of cellular immunity, such as autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (Jobs/Buckleys Syndrome) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggest that select patients might benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy even if their immune deficiency is not limited to antibody defects.

GMCSF has been shown to worsen conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) while ameliorating diseases such as Type I Diabetes. GMCSF has also been used clinically to combat neutropenia based on its immunostimulatory activity. Pathophysiological properties of GMCSF have been highlighted by the incidence of the global pandemic, COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2), where elevated levels of GMCSF were identified in COVID-19 patients in cases related to development of systemic hyperinflammation, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A key feature of signalling molecules like GMCSF is the selective and nuanced way in which responses can be tuned to external stimuli. The mechanism of how these signals are modulated are unknown and of particular interest. GMCSF and heparin have been shown to interact under low pH conditions. This binding interaction is important in two ways. Firstly, this pH sensitive interaction can serve as a basis to understand how cytokines can selectively interact with binding partners under variable physiological conditions. Secondly, in clinical settings where both anticoagulatory and immunostimulatory drugs are required, clear understanding of the binding interactions between the two drugs will help inform treatment decisions. Previously we identified heparin dependent structural changes as well as a striking dynamic change in GMCSF that was dependent on heparin chain length and pH using solution NMR studies which we believe to be dependent on a histidine triad. Here we have characterized GMCSF mutants using sited-directed mutagenesis to exchange critical histidine residues for alternate amino acid residues (including Ala, Phe, Tyr and Asp) to probe the contributions of histidine residues to the increased flexibility of GMCSF observed in acidic conditions. We find that the histidine residues are critical for stability and as little as one amino acid difference will alter flexibility and stability of the protein. In some instances, mutations of all three histidine residues can lead to partial protein unfolding. Our results highlight the critical chemical properties at the amino acid level that allow GMCSF to interact with heparin in an environmentally dependent way.","output":"Characterization of structural features driving promiscuous ligand binding in GMCSF."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The San Carlos population in Chile is an example of an underserved community due to lack of timely access to regular controls and laboratory results.

The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at P <0.05. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78  6.33 years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","output":"Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide range of cutaneous signs are attributed to COVID-19 infection This retrospective study assesses the presence and impact of dermatologic manifestations related to the spread of COVID-19 in Lombardy, the geographic district with the first outbreak in Italy A cohort of 345 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was collected from February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 Cutaneous signs and dermatologic diagnoses were recorded on admission, and during the course of the disease Of the 345 patients included in the study, 52 (15%) had new-onset dermatologic conditions related to COVID-19 We observed seven major cutaneous clinical patterns, merged under 3 main groups: Exanthems, vascular lesions, and other cutaneous manifestations Each subset was detailed with prevalence, age, duration, prognosis, and histology Cutaneous findings can lead to suspect COVID-19 infection and identify potentially contagious cases with indolent course","output":"COVID-19: The experience from Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coalescent is a powerful statistical framework that allows us to infer past population dynamics leveraging the ancestral relationships reconstructed from sampled molecular sequence data. In many biomedical applications, such as in the study of infectious diseases, cell development, and tumorgenesis, several distinct populations share evolutionary history and therefore become dependent. The inference of such dependence is a highly important, yet a challenging problem. With advances in sequencing technologies, we are well positioned to exploit the wealth of high-resolution biological data for tackling this problem. Here, we present a novel probabilistic model that relies on jointly distributed Markov random fields. We use this model to estimate past population dynamics of dependent populations and to quantify their degree of dependence. An essential feature of our approach is the ability to track the time-varying association between the populations while making minimal assumptions on their functional shapes via Markov random field priors. We provide nonparametric estimators, extensions of our base model that integrate multiple data sources, and fast scalable inference algorithms. We test our method using simulated data under various dependent population histories and demonstrate the utility of our model in shedding light on evolutionary histories of different variants of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Bayesian Inference of Dependent Population Dynamics in Coalescent Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to assess antibody seropositivity prevalence among symptomatic individuals and individuals with a high risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

However, these supervised models require a large amount of labeled data which are usually very costly or unavailable. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised End-to-end MOVing-window Attentive framework (called EMOVA) that has three key features for aspect mining. (1) Two neural layers with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are employed to learn representations of reviews. (2) Cross-View Training (CVT) is used to improve the representation learning over a small set of labeled reviews and a large set of unlabeled reviews from the same domain in a unified end-to-end architecture. (3) Since past nearby information in a text provides important semantic contexts for a prediction task in aspect mining, a moving-window attention component is proposed in EMOVA to enhance prediction accuracy.

So far, most approaches used to assess GABA activity involve invasive low -throughput electrophysiological techniques or rely on fluorescent dyes, preventing the ability to conduct noninvasive and thus nonperturbing screens. To address this limitation, we have developed an automated marker-free cell imaging method, based on digital holographic microscopy (DHM). This technology allows the automatically screening of compounds in multiple plates without having to label the cells or use special plates. This methodological approach was first validated by screening the GABA(A) receptor expressed in HEK cells using a selection of active compounds in agonist, antagonist, and modulator modes. Then, in a second blind screen of a library of 3041 compounds (mostly composed of natural products), 5 compounds having a specific agonist action on the GABA(A) receptor were identified. The hits validated from this unbiased screen were the natural products muscimol, neurosteroid alphaxalone, and three compounds belonging to the avermectin family, all known for having an agonistic effect on the GABA(A) receptor. The results obtained were exempt from false negatives (structurally similar unassigned hits), and false-positive hits were detected and discarded without the need for performing electrophysiological measurements. The outcome of the screen demonstrates the applicability of our screening by imaging method for the discovery of new chemical structures, particularly regarding chemicals interacting with the ionotropic GABA(A) receptor and more generally with any ligand-gated ion channels and transporters.","output":"Image-Based Marker-Free Screening of GABA(A) Agonists, Antagonists, and Modulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological age acceleration (BAA) models based on blood tests or DNA methylation emerge as a de facto standard for quantitative characterizations of the aging process.

LHQW has been used in routine influenza treatment for decades and plays a role in a broad-spectrum therapy on various influenza viruses. Aims of the study: The therapeutic effects of LHQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been fully elucidated. A retrospective study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the influence of LHQW on laboratory results related to the disease, and to provide evidence for the clinical practice of TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 248 patients who met the moderate type COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, and received treatment in Tongji Hospital. Patients were divided into control (158 cases, standard treatment) and LHQW treatment (90 cases, standard treatment combined with LHQW) groups according to the different treatments administered. All laboratory data were obtained after 5C7 days treatment. RESULTS: In this study, the average patient age was 58.95 years and 131 patients were male. The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics, symptoms, and treatment. Compared with in the control group, D-dimer and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly lower in the LHQW treatment group (2.474.67 vs. 1.683.61; 44.4730.24 vs. 35.3927.43; both P<0.05). Lymphocyte counts, albumin and hemoglobin levels were higher in the LHQW treatment group than those in the control group (1.000.46 vs. 1.130.5; 34.395.2 vs. 35.714.76; 127.0316.58 vs. 131.1114.66; both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study showed that LHQW significantly improved laboratory results of patients with COVID-19 and could be effectively applied alongside standard treatment of patients with moderate type COVID-19, providing preliminary clinical research evidence for the use of TCM in treatment of this disease.","output":"Positive effects of Lianhuaqingwen granules in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study of 248 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Due to their potent immune stimulation, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) variants with tumor-homing activity are attractive as novel antitumor drugs. The promising antitumor effect of NGR-TNF in clinical trials triggered extensive interest in developing novel tumor-homing TNF variants in recent years. Owing to its promising antitumor effect, NGR-TNF is usually used as a control for newly developed tumor-homing TNF variants. In our previous works, we produced a pericyte-targeting Z-TNF at high levels using the Escherichia coli (E. coli) M15-pQE30 system. To further compare Z-TNF and NGR-TNF, we attempted to express NGR-TNF using the same system. Surprisingly, native NGR-TNF was expressed at a low (~ 0.2 mg/L) level in E. coli M15 containing the pQE30 plasmid. However, a single nucleotide mutation of C to G, resulting in a substitution of leucine (L) with valine (V) at the start of TNF, increased the expression of NGR-TNF by ~ 100 times through improving transcription. In addition, the amino acid substitution showed a little impact on the receptor binding, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo antitumor effect of NGR-TNF. As fusing NGR to the N-terminus of TNF with a valine substitution did not reduce the protein yield, the TNF gene with a C > G mutation might be used to prepare novel tumor-homing TNF when the native TNF-based variant is expressed at an extremely low level in E. coli. Notably, in addition to the mutated valine, the impact of N-terminal additional amino acids provided by pQE30 vector on the function of TNF variant must be carefully evaluated. KEY POINTS: ? A single nucleotide mutation increased the expression of NGR-TNF by two orders. ? Nucleotide mutation-induced amino acid substitution did not reduce NGR-TNF activity.

COVID-19 vaccine willingness and the factors contributing to willingness in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. We administered an online survey from 1 December 2020 to 7 January 2021 to adults with MS to estimate COVID-19 vaccine willingness among adults with MS. Bivariate analysis with chi-square testing compared categorical variables associated with vaccine willingness. Results: Of 401 respondents, 70.1% were willing to receive an authorized COVID-19 vaccination if it was available to them, 22.7% were unsure, and 7.2% were unwilling. The most frequent concern for those unsure was vaccine safety. Vaccine willingness was associated with increased perceived personal risk of COVID-19 (chi2 = 45.4;p &lt; 0.0001), prior influenza vaccine acceptance (chi2 = 97.6;p &lt; 0.0001), higher educational level (chi2 = 50.2;p &lt; 0.0001), and if respondents discussed or planned to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with their neurologists (chi2 = 64.3;p &lt; 0.0001).

BNT162b2 showed lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta than against other strains raising concerns about effectiveness of vaccines against infections caused by Beta. We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Beta infections in Israel, a country with high vaccine uptake. METHODS: The Ministry of Health (MoH) identified Beta cases through mandatory reporting of SARS-CoV-2 cases and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from vaccination-breakthrough infections, reinfections, arriving international travelers, and a selection of other infected persons. A cohort analysis was conducted of exposure events of contacts of primary Beta cases. WGS was conducted on available PCR-positive specimens collected from contacts. VE estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) against confirmed and probable Beta infections were determined by comparing infection risk between unvaccinated and fully-vaccinated (7 days after the second dose) contacts, and between unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated (<7 days after the second dose) contacts. FINDINGS: MoH identified 310 Beta cases through Jun 27, 2021. During the study period (Dec 11, 2020 C Mar 25, 2021), 164 non-institutionalized primary Beta cases, with 552 contacts aged 16 years, were identified. 343/552 (62%) contacts were interviewed and tested. 71/343 (21%) contacts were PCR-positive. WGS was performed on 7/71 (10%) PCR-positive specimens; all were Beta. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected contacts, 48/71 (68%) were symptomatic, 10/71 (14%) hospitalized, and 2/71 (3%) died. Fully-vaccinated VE against confirmed or probable Beta infections was 72% (95% CI -5 C 97%; p=004) and against symptomatic confirmed or probable Beta infections was 100% (95% CI 19 C 100%; p=001). There was no evidence of protection in partially-vaccinated contacts. INTERPRETATION: In a prospective observational study, two doses of BNT162b2 were effective against confirmed and probable Beta infections.

In Brazil, SIV has been identified in pigs since 1978. After the emergence of pandemic H1N1 in 2009 (H1N1pdm09), few studies reported the presence of influenza virus in Brazilian herds. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the serological profile for influenza virus in farrow-to-finish pig farms in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. METHODS: Thirty farms with no SIV vaccination history were selected from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state (Zona da Mata, Triangulo Mineiro/Alto Paranaba, South/Southwest and the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area). At each farm, blood samples were randomly collected from 20 animals in each production cycle category: breeding animals (sows and gilts), farrowing crate (2C3 weeks), nursery (4C7 weeks), grower pigs (8C14 weeks), and finishing pigs (15C16 weeks), with 100 samples per farm and a total of 3000 animals in this study. The samples were tested for hemagglutination inhibition activity against H1N1 pandemic strain (A/swine/Brazil/11/2009) and H3N2 SIV (A/swine/Iowa/8548-2/98) reference strain. RESULTS: The percentages of seropositive animals for H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 were 2623% and 157%, respectively, and the percentages of seropositive herds for both viruses were 966% and 132%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The serological profiles differed for both viruses and among the studied areas, suggesting a high variety of virus circulation around the state, as well as the presence of seronegative animals susceptible to influenza infection and, consequently, new respiratory disease outbreaks.","output":"Distribution of antibodies against influenza virus in pigs from farrow-to-finish farms in Minas Gerais state, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Fangcang shelter hospitals, designated hospitals, and the time interval from illness onset to diagnosis toward the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%.

There is, however, need for evidence-based palliative care training and education of physicians and registered nurses. The purpose of this study was to describe the views of physicians and registered nurses regarding future competence needs within palliative care. METHODS: The study was conducted through use of a cross-sectional qualitative design. A total of 54 physicians and 110 registered nurses completed an open-ended questionnaire about the future competence needs of palliative care. The data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed four main competence needs within palliative care for the coming decade: palliative care competence at all levels within healthcare and social welfare services; individualized palliative care competence; person-centered encounters competence; and systematic competence development within palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: The results offer cues for education and professional development, which can be used to support physicians and registered nurses when future palliative care competences are included in educational programs. Seamless cooperation between palliative care services and educational institutions is recommended to ensure that undergraduate and postgraduate education is based on a continuous assessment of competence requirements within the field of palliative care.

In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of AKI among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia at a tertiary hospital in Bahrain and to describe the various aspects of AKI in these patients, including its relationship with respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality. Methods This retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia from April 1 to May 31, 2020, excluded those aged less than 18 years, those with end-stage renal disease, and those with renal transplants. Clinical and laboratory patient data were collected. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were used to define AKI. Results The mean age across the 73 included patients was approximately 54 years; about 60% were men, and nearly 58% were Bahraini nationals. Of the patients, 39.7% (29) developed AKI during hospitalization, out of which 11.0% reached stage 1, 15.1% reached stage 2, and 13.7% reached stage 3. Of all patients, seven (9.6%) required hemodialysis. Chronic kidney disease conferred an increased risk for AKI (P = 0.003) as did critical COVID-19 status (P < 0.001) and the necessity for mechanical ventilation or intensive care admission (P < 0.001 for both). Additionally, AKI was significantly associated with a lower PaO2/FiO2 (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/percentage of inspired oxygen) ratio (P < 0.001) and a greater number of medications for COVID-19 pneumonia (P = 0.003). Finally, in-hospital death tolls were remarkably higher in patients with AKI (P < 0.001). No association was found between AKI and each of the following therapies: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. Conclusions The rate of AKI in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia at our institution is relatively high and is strongly associated with disease severity, respiratory failure, and in-hospital mortality.

Prior studies have assessed eligibility rates among highly selected cohorts of patients referred for endovascular treatment, and the broader applicability of these devices to all patients with TAAA is unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the overall suitability of the 3 commercial 4-branched devices with or without adjunct procedure(s) in an unselected cohort of patients with TAAA and to identify areas for improvement in the next generation of devices. METHODS: A retrospective review of three-dimensional centerline reconstructions of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed in consecutive patients with TAAA seen between 2013 and 2017. All patients with contrast-enhanced CT imaging were included, regardless of prior evaluation for suitability for endovascular repair. Eligibility for a device was assessed based on instructions for use (IFU) from the device manufacturer along with prespecified anatomic criteria. Adjunct procedures were defined as carotid-subclavian revascularization, target vessel endovascular intervention, and iliac conduit/revascularization. RESULTS: Of 165 patients with TAAA, 122 had CT scans adequate for study inclusion. Eighteen patients (14.8%) were eligible for at least 1 device by IFU, and 41 (33.6%) could have been made eligible for at least 1 device by an adjunct procedure. Sixty-three (51.6%) were not eligible for any device within IFU even with adjunct procedures, including 31 of 32 patients with TAAA due to dissection. The most common reasons for ineligibility were perivisceral flow channel diameter <20 mm (n = 43) and an inadequate proximal seal zone (n = 29). Women were significantly less likely to be eligible for an off-the-shelf device (P = 0.03) and were more likely to require an iliac procedure to become eligible (P = 0.006). Almost none of the patients with dissection could receive a device even if adjunct procedures were used. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of patients with TAAA could not be made eligible for an off-the-shelf device based on manufacturers' criteria, even with adjunct procedures. Women and patients with TAAA due to dissection had higher rates of ineligibility. These data demonstrate that custom fenestrated devices and low-profile devices are needed to expand eligibility for endovascular repair of TAAA.","output":"Anatomic Eligibility for Commercial Branched Endograft Repair of Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health status in general population in different affected areas in China.

Lifestyle behavior modifications that promote the self-management of chronic cardiac diseases have been associated with an improved quality of life. However, whether a mobile health (mHealth) program can assist patients in the self-management of HF during the acute posthospital discharge period is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an mHealth program designed to enhance patients self-management of HF by increasing knowledge, self-efficacy, and symptom detection. We hypothesized that patients hospitalized with HF would be willing to use a feasibly deployed mHealth program after their hospital discharge. METHODS: We employed a patient-centered outcomes research methodology to design a stakeholder-informed mHealth program. Adult patients with HF admitted to a large academic hospital were enrolled and randomized to receive the mHealth intervention versus usual care. Our feasibility outcomes included ease of program deployment, use of the clinical escalation process, duration of participant recruitment, and participant attrition. Surveys assessing the demographics and clinical characteristics of HF were measured at baseline and at 30 and 90 days after discharge. RESULTS: The study period was between July 1, 2019, and April 7, 2020. The mean cohort (N=31) age was 60.4 (range 22-85) years. Over half of the participants were men (n=18, 58%) and 77% (n=24) were White. There were no significant differences in baseline measures. We determined that an educational mHealth program tailored for patients with HF is feasibly deployed and acceptable by patients. Though not significant, we found notable trends including a higher mean quality of life at 30 days posthospitalization among program users and a longer duration before rehospitalization, which are suggestive of better HF prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our mHealth tool should be further assessed in a larger comparative effectiveness trial. Our pilot intervention offers promise as an innovative means to help HF patients lead healthy, independent lives. These preliminary data suggest that patient-centered mHealth tools can enable high-risk patients to play a role in the management of their HF after discharge.

Methods We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under \\"mitigation\\" to modelled events under \\"no mitigation\\" to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and HRNB at GBP 20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita) basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government responses. Findings The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, GBP 33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and GBP 1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at GBP 20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to GBP 1,455 GDP loss using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total GBP 3075 GDP loss. Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses did not appear to have best outcomes. Interpretation The benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

Based on a qualitative study of 20 socially diverse households, this essay proposes a typology of adaptive commensal eating patterns: 1) Eating together can provide reassurance by reproducing ordinary routines or by enacting food traditions;2) Tinkering with lockdown rules leads to creative new forms of commensality, or to an ersatz of commensality;3) Sharing every meal with the same people can trigger the rejection of commensal practices These patterns may also represent possible phases in the experience of lockdown, since some individuals shifted from one pattern to another The final part of the paper discusses the very nature of the social link highlighted through the lens of commensality [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Food & Foodways: History & Culture of Human Nourishment is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Reflection: Snatched Commensality: To eat or not to eat together in times of Covid-19 in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already affected 2883603 and killed 198842 people, as of April 27, 2020. Because there is no specific therapeutic drug, drug repurposing has been proposed. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control its replication, and several compounds have been suggested. The present study predicts relative efficacies of thirty known or repurposed compounds in inhibiting the RdRp. METHODS: The three-dimensional structure of the target enzyme was loaded into Molegro virtual docker software, followed by chemical structures of the test compounds. The docking was performed between the compounds and the active site of the enzyme to determine docking scores, and the energy liberated when the two dock. Thus, docking scores signify the affinity of ligand(s) with the active site of enzyme(s) and thus its inhibitory potential. RESULTS: Among known inhibitors, remdesivir was found to have the highest affinity for the active site of the RdRp. Among all compounds, chlorhexidine was predicted as the most potent inhibitor. Furthermore, the results predict the relative efficacy of different drugs as inhibitors of the drug target. CONCLUSION: While the study identifies several compounds as inhibitors of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, the prediction of their relative efficacies may be useful in future studies. While nucleoside analogs compete with the natural substrate of RdRp, thereby terminating RNA replication, other compounds would physically block entry of the natural substrates into the active site. Thus, based on the findings, we recommend in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials to determine their effectiveness against COVID-19.","output":"Evaluating the potential of different inhibitors on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: A molecular modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, skin manifestations, if present, were not paid enough attention Then, the focus moved toward the impact of the prolonged use of personal protective measures in both healthcare workers and patients In the meantime, attention is increasingly paid to dermatology as a result of the concern for certain groups of dermatologic patients, including those whose condition may worsen by the thorough disinfection measures and those treated with immunosuppressants or immunomodulators Following patients with psoriasis on biological therapy, as well as other inflammatory and autoimmune cutaneous disorders such as atopic dermatitis, pemphigus, pemphigoid diseases, and skin cancer provoked the interest of dermatologists Finally, an intriguing question to the dermatologic society was whether skin changes during COVID-19 infection exist and what could be their diagnostic or prognostic value Here, we summarize skin conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, patient information, and expert recommendations and give an overview about the registries launched to document skin changes during COVID-19, as well as details about certain patient groups infected with SARS-CoV-2, for example, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune bullous diseases","output":"Covid-19 pandemic and the skin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New technologies that enhance soil biodiversity and minimize the use of scarce resources while boosting crop production are highly sought to mitigate the increasing threats that climate change, population growth, and desertification pose on the food infrastructure.

RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 131 were males (62.4%). The median Age was 64 years (IQR: 56-71). Of 92 (43.8%) patients who developed AKI during hospitalization, 13 (14.1%), 15 (16.3%) and 64 (69.6%) were classified as being at stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 54 patients (58.7%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. Age, sepsis, nephrotoxic drug, invasive mechanical ventilation and elevated baseline serum creatinine levels were associated with the occurrence of AKI. Renal recovery during hospitalization was identified among 16 patients with AKI (17.4%), who had a significantly shorter time from admission to AKI diagnosis, lower incidence of right heart failure and higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We obtained acute cardiovascular hospital episodes during the years 2019C2020 from region-wide data on public healthcare usage for the population of Catalonia (North-East Spain). We fitted time models to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute heart failure (HF) admissions during the first pandemic wave, the between-waves period, and the second wave compared with the corresponding pre-COVID-19 periods and to test for the interaction with sex, age, and area-based socioeconomic level. We evaluated the effect of COVID-19 period on in-hospital mortality. ACS (n = 8,636) and HF (n = 27,566) episodes were defined using primary diagnostic ICD-10 codes. ACS and HF admissions decreased during the first wave (IRR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.58C0.76 and IRR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.55C0.68, respectively) and during the second wave (IRR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.72C0.88 and IRR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.69C0.84, respectively); acute HF admissions also decreased in the period between waves (IRR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.74C0.89). The impact was similar in all sex and socioeconomic subgroups and was higher in older patients with ACS. In-hospital mortality was higher than expected only during the first wave.

Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies promote the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","output":"Receptor utilization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) indicates a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives.

A combined inability to control viral replication and exacerbated inflammatory immune activation in elderly patients causes irreparable immune-mediated tissue pathology in response to infection. Key to these responses are type I, II, and III interferons (IFNs), which are involved in inducing an antiviral response, as well as controlling and suppressing inflammation and immunopathology. IFNs support monocyte/macrophage-stimulated immune responses that clear infection and promote their immunosuppressive functions that prevent excess inflammation and immune-mediated pathology. The timing and magnitude of IFN responses to infection are critical towards their immunoregulatory functions and ability to prevent immunopathology. Aging is associated with multiple defects in the ability of macrophages and dendritic cells to produce IFNs in response to viral infection, leading to a dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses. Understanding the implications of aging on IFN-regulated inflammation will give critical insights on how to treat and prevent severe infection in vulnerable individuals. In this review, we describe the causes of impaired IFN production in aging, and the evidence to suggest that these impairments impact the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response to infection, thereby causing disease pathology.","output":"Aging and Interferons: Impacts on Inflammation and Viral Disease Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a missing link in the natural history of COVID-19, from first (usually milder) symptoms to hospitalization and/or death. To fill in this gap, we characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study. : Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)a primary-care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers. We included all patients in the database who were 15 years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies). Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics, co-morbidity and previous drug use at the time of diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and results. : Study outcomes included 30-day hospitalization for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality. RESULTS: We identified 118 150 and 95 467 COVID-19 patients for characterization and outcome studies, respectively. Most were women (58.7%) and young-to-middle-aged (e.g. 21.1% were 45C54 years old). Of the 44 575 who were tested with PCR, 32 723 (73.4%) tested positive. In the month after diagnosis, 14.8% (14.6C15.0) were hospitalized, with a greater proportion of men and older people, peaking at age 75C84 years. Thirty-day fatality was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.4% to 3.6%), higher in men, increasing with age and highest in those residing in nursing homes [24.5% (23.4% to 25.6%)]. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infections were widespread in the community, including all ageCsex strata. However, severe forms of the disease clustered in older men and nursing-home residents.

Therefore, in this study, a hybrid methodology is proposed to expose the process of this problem which helps managers to learn how they can determine the optimal number of suppliers. We address this gap by developing an integrated approach based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) comprising best-worst method (BWM), simple additive weighting (SAW), and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and simulation to determine the optimal number of suppliers. This study utilizes a comprehensive approach based on leagile and environmentally sustainable criteria to determine the optimal number of suppliers. To examine the efficiency of the proposed approach, an empirical case study is conducted in an Iranian oil company.

We compared characteristics and outcomes of delirious and nondelirious patients enrolled in a multicenter trial comparing protocolized sedation with protocolized sedation plus daily sedation interruption. DESIGN Randomized trial. SETTING Sixteen North American medical and surgical ICUs. PATIENTS Four hundred thirty critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults. INTERVENTIONS All patients had hourly titration of opioid and benzodiazepine infusions using a validated sedation scale. For patients in the interruption group, infusions were resumed, if indicated, at half of previous doses. Delirium screening occurred daily; positive screening was defined as an Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score of 4 or more at any time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Delirium was diagnosed in 226 of 420 assessed patients (53.8%). Coma was identified in 32.7% of delirious compared with 22.7% of nondelirious patients (p = 0.03). The median time to onset of delirium was 3.5 days (interquartile range, 2-7), and the median duration of delirium was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4). Delirious patients were more likely to be male (61.1% vs 46.6%; p = 0.005), have a surgical/trauma diagnosis (21.2% vs 11.0%; p = 0.030), and history of tobacco (31.5% vs 16.2%; p = 0.002) or alcohol use (34.6% vs 20.9%; p = 0.009). Patients with positive delirium screening had longer duration of ventilation (13 vs 7 d; p < 0.001), ICU stay (12 vs 8 d; p < 0.0001), and hospital stay (24 vs 15 d; p < 0.0001). Delirious patients were more likely to be physically restrained (86.3% vs 76.7%; p = 0.014) and undergo tracheostomy (34.6% vs 15.5%; p < 0.0001). Antecedent factors independently associated with delirium onset were restraint use (hazard ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.33-2.63; p = 0.0003), antipsychotic administration (hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.005-2.767; p = 0.047), and midazolam dose (hazard ratio, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.997-1.0; p = 0.049). There was no difference in delirium prevalence or duration between the interruption and control groups. CONCLUSION In mechanically ventilated adults, delirium was common and associated with longer duration of ventilation and hospitalization. Physical restraint was most strongly associated with delirium.","output":"Prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of delirium in mechanically ventilated adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) is a common complication across the globe.

Methods The nationwide administrative database (German federal statistical office) was used to extract all adult inpatient TIA and stroke cases and corresponding procedural codes for the period 2011-2017. Numbers were specified according to age, sex, stroke unit (SU) and critical care treatment (ICU), early transfer, and in-hospital mortality. Findings Inpatient adult TIA/stroke cases increased from annually 102,406 / 250,199 (2011) to 106,245 / 264,208 (2017). 84% of strokes were ischemic (AIS) also having the highest relative increase most likely due to more accurate coding within the time period, 68.2% of AIS were treated on SUs. 78% of hemorrhagic strokes were intracerebral hematomas (ICH; rather than subarachnoid hemorrhages [SAH]). Hemorrhagic strokes were increasingly treated on SUs (32.6% [2011], 37.8% [2017]). 68.8% of SAH were treated on ICUs (ICH:36.3%, AIS:10.3%). Early transfer in AIS increased (2.0 to 3.1%). Hemorrhagic strokes were associated with higher in-hospital mortality (SAH:19.6%, ICH:28.2%, AIS:7.3%). Interpretation The absolute increase of strokes presumably reflects the aging society and more awareness for cerebrovascular disease. The relative increase of AIS may be attributable to an increased neurological expertise. The increasing amount of early transfers in AIS reflects new specialized treatment options.

Such inhibition is time-dependent with the progression of PRRSV infection. We also show that the inhibition of IFN- transcription in the early stage of infection could not be due to inhibition of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, though significant decrease of p-IRF3 and its nuclear translocation in PRRSV-infected and poly (I:C) cells was observed later at 48 h post-infection. The different patterns of inhibition for IFN- transcription and IRF3 phosphorylation have important implications as to the mechanism(s) by which PRRSV suppresses the type I IFN signaling at early stage of infection.

Due to the problem of excessive fluctuation and highly volatile ECL estimation, models that produce satisfactory PD and thus ECL estimations in the context of existing risk management techniques are lacking. In this study, we explore the usage of the credit default swap index (CDX), a markets expectation of future PD, as a predictor of the default rate (DR). By comparing the goodness-of-fit of logistic regression, several conclusions are drawn. Firstly, in general, GDP has considerable explanatory power for the default rate which is consistent with current models in practice. Secondly, although both GDP and CDX fit the DR well for rating B class, CDX has a significantly better fit of DR for ratings [A, Baa, Ba]. Thirdly, compared with low-rated companies, the relationship between the DR and GDP is relatively weak for rating A. This phenomenon implies that, in addition to using macroeconomic variables and firm-specific explanatory variables in the PD estimation model, high-rated companies exhibit a greater need to use market supplemental information, such as CDX, to capture the changes in the DR.","output":"Goodness-of-Fit of Logistic Regression of the Default Rate on GDP Growth Rate and on CDX Indices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper employs regression with ARIMA errors (RegARIMA) to quantify the impacts of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily new cases, seasonal and calendar effects, and other factors on activity trends across the timeline of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The discussion focuses on two controversial policy sets imposed by the Japanese government that aim to contain the pandemic and to stimulate the recovery of the economy. The containing effect was achieved by stay-at-home requests and declaring a State of Emergency in the combat against the first waves of infectious cases. After observing reduced cases, Go-to-travel and Go-to-eat campaigns were launched in July 2020 to encourage recreational travel and to revive the economy. To better understand the impact of the policies we utilize Google trends which measure how much these policies are looked up online. We suggest this reflects how much they are part of the public discussion. A case study is conducted in Kyoto, a city famous for tourism. The proposed RegARIMA model is compared with linear regression and time series models. The outperformances in measuring the magnitude of intervention impacts and forecasting the future trends are confirmed by using twelve activity or mobility indices as the dependent variable. Nine indices are released by Google and Apple and three are obtained from local Wi-Fi packet sensors.

The present work proposed a novel multiple-feature sampling scheme that can extract several features from one type of drug association. Thirteen classification algorithms were employed to construct classifiers with features yielded by such scheme.

Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness, multi-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works assume a unique way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned to the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be systematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A representation for complex tasks is proposed to avoid the non-convex task decomposition enumeration: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is chosen as a metric in the objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is described to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two different practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service coordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19).

Yet, few human studies have been conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these clinically beneficial effects in patients with CAD. Accordingly, the EMPA-CARD trial was designed to focus on the molecular effects of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM and CAD. METHODS: In this multicenter, triple-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with documented known T2DM and CAD will be recruited. They will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio and assigned into two groups of empagliflozin 10 mg/daily and placebo. The primary endpoint is the effect of empagliflozin on changes of plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) after 26 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints will consist of changes in other inflammatory biomarkers (Interleukin 1-beta and high-sensitive C-reactive protein), markers of oxidative stress, platelet function, and glycemic status.

METHODS A 10-question survey was developed for the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health and provided electronically to 127 deans and program directors in November and December 2019, of whom 58 (46%) responded. RESULTS Of 54 respondents to the question on term limits, 45 deans and directors of schools and programs of public health served with no terms or limits and 9 served with terms of 3-5 years with no limits on the number of terms. Respondents largely agreed with most arguments for or against term limits. Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 2 arguments for term limits: diversity (n = 40) and succession planning (n = 40). Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 3 arguments against term limits: stable and continuous leadership (n = 40), time for leadership development (n = 37), and loss of institutional memory (n = 35). Twenty-seven of 53 responding deans and directors viewed the most appropriate terms and limits as being more restrictive than their current terms; the other 26 viewed the most appropriate terms as being the same as their current terms.

This study develops a large-scale method to determine the minimum fleet size under uncertainty, based on the bike sharing data of millions of trips in Nanjing. It is found that the algorithm of minimizing fleet size under the incomplete-information scenario is effective in handling future uncertainty. For a dockless bike sharing system, supplying 14.5% of the original fleet could meet 96.8% of trip demands. Meanwhile, the results suggest that providing a integrated service platform that integrates multiple companies can significantly reduce the total fleet size by 44.6%. Moreover, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study proposes a social distancing policy that maintains a suitable usage interval.

Through collaborative modeling, end-users, stakeholders, experts, and entrepreneurs are able to create a shared understanding of a system representation. While the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the major conceptual modeling languages in object-oriented software engineering, more and more concerns arise from the modeling quality of UML and its tool support. Among them, the limitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of natural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Virtual Reality (VR) technology for collaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative software design using conventional devices (Desktop PC, Laptop). For this purpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural collaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study with 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with conventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, but the user's fun, the feeling of being in the same room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were increased.","output":"Collaborative Software Modeling in Virtual Reality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Intestinal obstruction by a foreign body is a common occurrence in domestic animals, needing the attention of veterinarians and owners, given that a serious complication of this condition is intestinal rupture, with consequentperitonitis.

The goal of this study is to measure serological response to BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines in patients with IBD receiving different biologic therapies. MethodWe performed a multi-center prospective study between August 1st, 2021, and September 15th, 2021. We measured seropositivity of SARS-CoV2 antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibody concentrations, in patients with IBD receiving biologic therapies between 4-10 weeks after second dose or 3-6 weeks after first dose of vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. ResultsThere were 126 patients enrolled (mean age, 31 years; 60% male; 71% Crohns disease, 29% ulcerative colitis). 92 patients were vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine (73%) and 34 patients with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (27%). The proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving 2 doses of the vaccine in patients treated with infliximab and adalimumab were 44 out of 59 patients (74.5%) and 13 out of 16 patients (81.2%), respectively. Whereas the proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving two doses of the vaccine in patients treated with ustekinumab and vedolizumab were 100% and 92.8%, respectively. In patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab, the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels after two-dose vaccination was 40 out of 59 patients (67.7%) and 14 out 16 patients (87.5%), respectively. Whereas the proportions of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels were 12 out of 13 patients (92.3%) and 13 out of 14 patients (92.8%) in patients receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab. ConclusionThe majority of patients with IBD on infliximab, adalimumab, and vedolizumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key component in COVID-19 infection. Expressed on cell membranes in target pulmonary and intestinal host cells, ACE2 serves as an anchor for initial viral homing, binding to COVID-19 spike-protein domains to enable viral entry into cells and subsequent replication. Viral attachment is facilitated by a multiplicity of membranal and circulating proteases that further uncover attachment loci. Inherent or acquired enhancement of membrane ACE2 expression, likely leads to a higher degree of infection and may explain the predisposition to severe disease among males, diabetics, or patients with respiratory or cardiac diseases. Additionally, once attached, viral intracellular translocation and replication leads to depletion of membranal ACE2 through degradation and shedding. ACE2 generates Ang 1-7, which serves a critical role in counterbalancing the vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-coagulant effects of ACE-induced Ang II. Therefore, Ang 1-7 may decline in tissues infected by COVID-19, leading to unopposed deleterious outcomes of Ang II. This likely leads to microcirculatory derangement with endothelial damage, profound inflammation, and coagulopathy that characterize the more severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection. Our understanding of COVID-ACE2 associations is incomplete, and some conceptual formulations are currently speculative, leading to controversies over issues such as the usage of ACE inhibitors or Ang-receptor blockers (ARBs).

Sweden moved upper-secondary students to remote learning but, as the only country in the OECD, kept schools at lower levers open throughout the pandemic. MethodsUsing nationwide register data, we estimate the difference in the use of mental healthcare services between upper- and lower-secondary students during the pandemic, and relate this to the same group difference prior to the pandemic. For the main analysis, this difference-in-difference approach is applied to the period April-June 2020 when upper-secondary schools were fully closed. We also study the periods July-December 2020 when upper-secondary schools were largely open, and January-March 2021 when they were partially closed. We study the impact on all contacts with hospitals and specialist psychiatric care due to mental and behavioral disorder, as well as prescriptions for antidepressants, insomnia, and ADHD drugs. FindingsCompared with expected rates, the use of mental healthcare services among upper-secondary students fell by -3.71 [CI95 -5.52 to -1.91] cases per 1000 during April-June 2020, largely due to a reduction in depression and anxiety-related diagnoses (-1.49; CI95 [-2.36 to -0.63]) and prescriptions (-1.80; CI95 [-2.93 to -0.68]). This reduction in the use of mental healthcare services corresponds to a 4.36% CI95 [-6.47 to -2.25]) decrease compared to the level prior to the pandemic. The decrease compared to expected rates persists through July-December 2020 (-3.55%; CI95 [-5.38 to -1.71]) and January-March 2021 (-5.23%; CI95 [-7.24 to -3.21]). The reduction is stronger among students in the 2nd (-5.06%; CI95 [-8.02 to -2.09]) and 3rd (-4.86%; CI95 [-8.19 to -1.53]) year of upper-secondary school.

This is partially due to the lack of primary robust trial-based data and heterogenous study designs. This evidence summary, aims to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on morbidity and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: For this study, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published from December 2019 to January 2022 presenting the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 severity were screened and selected from PubMed and Google scholar. After initial screening, 10 eligible reviews were identified and quality of included reviews were assessed using AMSTAR and GRADE tools and overlapping among the primary studies used were also assessed. RESULTS: The number of primary studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 3-13. Meta-analysis of seven systematic reviews showed strong evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of mortality (Odds ratio: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.346-0.664;p < 0.001) in COVID patients. It was also observed that supplementation reduces the need for intensive care (Odds ratio: 0.35;95%CI: 0.28-0.44;p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (Odds ratio: 0.54;95% CI: 0.411-0.708;p < 0.001) requirement. The findings were robust and reliable as level of heterogeneity was considerably low.

We analysed data from putative household infector infectee pairs in the Virus Watch Community cohort study to assess the serial interval of COVID-19 and whether this was affected by emergence of the B.1.17 variant. Methods The Virus Watch study is an online, prospective, community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Putative household infector infectee pairs were identified where more than one person in the household had a positive swab matched to an illness episode. Data on whether individual infections were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant were not available. We therefore developed a classification system based on the percentage of cases estimated to be due to B.1.17 in national surveillance data for different English regions and study weeks. Results Out of 24,887 illnesses reported, 915 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 186 likely infector infectee pairs in 186 households amongst 372 individuals were identified. The mean COVID-19 serial interval was 3.18 (95%CI: 2.55;3.81) days.

The current homologous vaccine regimen is experimentally switching to heterologous vaccination at several study sites. However, the reactogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx1-S and mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. We have conducted a systematic review to summarize the current findings on the safety and immunogenicity of this heterologous vaccination and elucidate their implications against SARS-CoV-2.

Our review found that participants with ChAdOx1/BNT162b2, ChAdOx1-S/mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2/ChAdOx1-S did not have the serious adverse events seen with homologous vaccination. Participants with the heterologous regimen (ChAdOx1/BNT162b2, ChAdOx1-S/mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2/ChAdOx1-S), compared with those with two doses of ChAdOx1-S, have shown a more robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, such as higher levels of responsive antibodies or increased numbers of spike-specific T-cells.

The study was also designed in part to assess the performance of the conventional methods against molecular methods. Results Viral pathogens were detected in 158 (95.8%) of the patients. Single virus infections were detected in 114 (67.9%) patients; 46 (27.9%) were co-infected with different viruses including double-virus infections in 37 (22.4%) and triple-virus infections in 9 (5.5%) cases. Approximately 70% of samples were found to be positive using conventional methods compared with 96% using molecular methods. A wide range of respiratory viruses were detected in the study. There was a high prevalence of RSV (50.3%) infections, particularly group B viruses. Other etiological agents including HAdV, HMPV, IFV-A, PIV 1C3, HBoV, HCoV-OC43 and HEV were detected in 14.5, 9.6, 9.1, 4.8, 3.6, 2.4 and 1.8 percent of the samples, respectively. Conclusion Our results demonstrated the increased sensitivity of molecular detection methods compared with conventional methods for the diagnosis of ARTIs in hospitalized children. This is the first report of HMPV infections in Malaysia.","output":"Diversity of respiratory viruses detected among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections at Hospital Serdang, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brand rumors can harm brands image and bring significant impacts on customers decision-making and sharing behavior. Finding practical strategies for preventing the spread of brand rumors continues to be a challenge. Building on the social contagion theory, the current research enriches the discussion on understanding why people spread rumors and how to deal with the spreading of rumors. Sharing brand rumors is motivated by a variety of complex psychological reasons, but prior research didnt adequately analyze the problem from a complexity perspective. Therefore, using a sample of 416 interviewers within eight types of brand rumors, this study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate the combination of rumor psychological communication motivations in brand activities and solutions to prevent the spread of brand rumors. The current study discoveries three and two first-level configurational solutions, respectively, that can promote positive and negative rumor spreading. To summarize, emotional stimulation is a key component in the spread of rumors; altruism and relationship management motivation can coexist at times; and untrusted rumors are disseminated through other motivation factors. Solutions to prevent rumors from spreading are also provided. Furthermore, the findings help to understand the psychology of configurational motivation and how it can help brands reduce the spread of brand rumors. Finally, these discoveries theoretical contributions and practical implications are presented.","output":"Sharing or Not: Psychological Motivations of Brand Rumors Spread and the Stop Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the numbers of aged populations have risen considerably in the last few decades, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed an extensive vulnerability among these populations. Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adultsdenoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost. In recovering patients, muscle strength and physical performance have been evaluated by electromyography and traditional tests such as the six-minute walk test. Effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are necessary in order to prevent muscle loss and associated physical decline in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Screening for Sarcopenia (Physical Frailty) in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Policy makers have relaxed restrictions for certain nonessential industries, including construction, jeopardizing the effectiveness of social distancing measures and putting already at-risk populations at greater risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In Texas, Latinx populations are overly represented among construction workers, and thus have elevated rates of exposure that are compounded by prevalent high-risk comorbidities and lack of access to health care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between construction work during the COVID-19 pandemic and hospitalization rates for construction workers and the surrounding community. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model used a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, stratified by age and risk group, with construction workers modeled explicitly. The model was based on residents of the AustinCRound Rock metropolitan statistical area, with a population of 2.17 million. Based on 500 stochastic simulations for each of 15 scenarios that varied the size of the construction workforce and level of worksite transmission risk, the association between continued construction work and hospitalizations was estimated and then compared with anonymized line-list hospitalization data from central Texas through August 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: Social distancing interventions, size of construction workforce, and level of disease transmission at construction worksites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each scenario, the total number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and the relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers was projected and then compared with relative risks estimated from reported hospitalization data. RESULTS: Allowing unrestricted construction work was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalization rates through mid-August 2020 from 0.38 per 1000 residents to 1.5 per 1000 residents and from 0.22 per 1000 construction workers to 9.3 per 1000 construction workers. This increased risk was estimated to be offset by safety measures (such as thorough cleaning of equipment between uses, wearing of protective equipment, limits on the number of workers at a worksite, and increased health surveillance) that were associated with a 50% decrease in transmission. The observed relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers compared with other occupational categories among adults aged 18 to 64 years was 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that unrestricted work in high-contact industries, such as construction, is associated with a higher level of community transmission, increased risks to at-risk workers, and larger health disparities among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.","output":"Estimated Association of Construction Work With Risks of COVID-19 Infection and Hospitalization in Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent times, we assist to an ever growing diffusion of smart medical sensors and Internet of things devices that are heavily changing the way healthcare is approached worldwide.

Small case series have been reported in the literature but few studies with a large number of patients have been published. We present our experience with the SFD for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in Canada. METHODS Centers across Canada using SFDs were contacted to fill out a case report form for patients treated with an SFD in their center. Individual centers were responsible for approval from their ethics committee. Image analysis was performed by individual operators. The case report forms were collected and the final analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 92 patients were treated with SFDs in eight centers in Canada between January 2009 and August 2013. The aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation in 16 patients and in the anterior circulation in 76 patients. Most aneurysms (75%) were saccular in shape; 22% were fusiform and 3% were blister aneurysms. The size of the aneurysms varied from 2 to 60 mm with the neck varying from 2 to 60 mm. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were 8.7% and 2.2%, respectively. At the last available follow-up, 83.1% of the aneurysms were either completely or near-completely occluded. The rate of complications was higher for fusiform aneurysms (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The SFD appears to be an important tool for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. Treatment outcomes and complication rates remain a problem, but should be considered in the context of available alternative interventions.

METHODS: ELISA and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expressions of target proteins in serum and liver tissue of HCC patients, and the correlation between AT1R, PLC-1 and CaM and postoperative survival status of patients was followed up and determined. CCK-8 method was used to screen the doses of Ang II and candesartan sensitive to HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. Transwell experiment was used to observe the effects of different drugs on the migration and invasion activity of HCC cells. Meanwhile, flow cytometry and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of AT1R, PLC-1 and CaM in the cells. Then PLC-1 siRNA was selected to transfect HCC cells, so as to further clarify the mechanism of the above signal proteins. HepG2 cells were inoculated under the hepatic capsule of mice to induce the formation of HCC in situ. Ang II and candesartan were used to stimulate HCC mice to observe the difference in liver appearance and measure the liver index. Finally, ELISA and immunofluorescence experiments were selected to analyze the levels of target proteins in mouse serum and liver tissue. RESULTS: The expression levels of target proteins in serum and liver tissue of HCC patients were significantly increased, and the postoperative survival time of patients with high expression of AT1R, PLC-1 or CaM was obviously shortened. Ang II and candesartan could significantly promote and inhibit the motility of HCC cells, and had different effects on the levels of AT1R, PLC-1 and CaM in cells. However, in hepatocellular carcinoma cells transfected with PLC-1 siRNA, the intervention ability of drugs was obviously weakened. Ang II could significantly promote the formation and progression of mouse HCC, while candesartan had the opposite effect. Meanwhile, medications could affect the expressions of target proteins in mouse serum and liver tissue. CONCLUSION: AT1R, PLC-1 and CaM may be risk factors affecting the formation and prognosis of HCC, and the PLC-1/CaM signaling pathway mediated by AT1R is an important way to regulate the migration and invasion activity of HCC cells.

Participants from Chelyabinsk (Russian Federation) who were at an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (high-risk group, n = 1091) and participants who either had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or were suspected to have experienced COVID-19 in the past (symptomatic group, n = 692) were enrolled between 28 September and 30 December 2020. Blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-5501 SARS-Cov-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and D-5502 SARS-Cov-2-IgM-EIA-BEST (AO Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia). The overall seropositivity rate was 28.33C28.53%.

Due to its pharmacokinetic variability and a narrow therapeutic index, the safe administration of the drug requires its therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in patients receiving the treatment. In this work, we present a label-free method for the TDM of edoxaban by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The new method utilises the thiol chemistry of the drug to chemisorb its molecules onto a highly sensitive SERS substrate. This leads to the formation of efficient hotspots and a strong signal enhancement of the drug Raman bands, thus negating the need for a Raman reporter for its SERS quantification. The standard samples were run with a concentration range of 1.4  10(?4) M to 10(?12) M using a mobile phase comprising of methanol/acetonitrile (85:15 v/v) at 291 nm followed by the good linearity of R(2) = 0.997. The lowest limit of quantification (LOQ) by the SERS method was experimentally determined to be 10(?12) M, whereas LOQ for HPLC-UV was 4.5  10(?7) M, respectively. The new method was used directly and in a simple HPLC-SERS assembly to detect the drug in aqueous solutions and in spiked human blood plasma down to 1 pM.

Little is known about the effect of antibodies against the virus or the distribution of the virus in different organs of infected turtles. In this study, a partial protein of TSHSV-HP4 was produced using a prokaryotic expression system, and its polyclonal antibody was generated. The polyclonal antibody was confirmed by western blot and dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA). The distribution of TSHSV in different organs of T. sinensis was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the expression of immune-related genes was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results indicated that the recombinant TSHSV-HP4 protein was successfully expressed, and the generated polyclonal antibody showed specific binding to viral particles in the lung tissues of infected turtles. The IHC assay indicated that the virus was highly localized in various cells, including intestinal lymphocytes, enterocytes, kidney epithelial cells, spleen cells, lung macrophages, and cardiomyocytes. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that TSHSV was detected in all organs tested, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and heart. The numbers of viral mRNA copies in lung and heart tissues were significantly higher in the virus-antibody group than in the virus group. The interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) and radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) were highly upregulated in all groups of infected turtles. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) seemed to occur after stimulation by the polyclonal antibody, because significantly greater expression of the two genes was detected in the virus-antibody group than in the virus group.

We do so through an agent-based lattice model of a disease spreading in a heterogeneous population.We predict that an epidemic driven by superspreaders will spread rapidly in cities, but not in the countryside where the sparse population limits the maximal number of secondary infections.

One of the unprecedented challenges is defining the optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. To link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in six major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. Whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza, or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less than 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in d-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population worldwide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.","output":"Pathogenesis-directed therapy of 2019 novel coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The unprecedented success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy in the management of B-cell malignancies comes with a price of specific side effects. Healthy B-cell depletion is an anticipated 'on-target' 'off-tumor' side effect and can contribute to severe and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia. Evidence-based guidelines for the use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT) for infection prevention are lacking in this population. AREAS COVERED This article reviews the mechanisms and epidemiology of hypogammaglobulinemia and antibody deficiency, association with infections, and strategies to address these issues in CD19- and BCMA-CAR-T-cell recipients. EXPERT OPINION CD19 and BCMA CAR-T-cell therapy result in unique immune deficits due to depletion of specific B-lineage cells and may require different infection prevention strategies. Hypogammaglobulinemia before and after CAR-T-cell therapy is frequent, but data on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IGRT are lacking. Monthly IGRT should be prioritized for patients with severe or recurrent bacterial infections. IGRT may be more broadly necessary to prevent infections in BCMA-CAR-T-cell recipients and children with severe hypogammaglobulinemia irrespective of infection history. Vaccinations are indicated to augment humoral immunity and can be immunogenic despite cytopenias; re-vaccination(s) may be required. Controlled trials are needed to better understand the role of IGRT and vaccines in this population.","output":"Managing Hypogammaglobulinemia in Patients Treated with CAR-T-cell Therapy: Key Points for Clinicians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As demonstrated with the novel coronavirus pandemic, rapid and accurate diagnosis is key to determine the clinical characteristic of a disease and to improve vaccine development. Once the infected person is identified, hematological findings may be used to predict disease outcome and offer the correct treatment. Rapid and accurate diagnosis and clinical parameters are pivotal to track infections during clinical trials and set protection status. This is also applicable for re-emerging diseases like dengue fever, which causes outbreaks in Asia and Latin America every 4 to 5 years. Some areas in the US are also endemic for the transmission of dengue virus (DENV), the causal agent of dengue fever. However, significant number of DENV infections in rural areas are diagnosed solely by clinical and hematological findings because of the lack of availability of ELISA or PCR-based tests or the infrastructure to implement them in the near future. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are a less sensitive, yet they represent a timely way of detecting DENV infections. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an association between hematological findings and the probability for an NS1-based DENV RDT to detect the DENV NS1 antigen. We also aimed to describe the hematological parameters that are associated with the diagnosis through each test.","output":"Laboratory Findings in Patients with Probable Dengue Diagnosis from an Endemic Area in Colombia in 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A particularly striking new phenomenon in recent years is the live streaming of video games through popular platforms, such as Twitch. This study focuses on the motivations and types of use underlying viewer participation in live streaming platforms. Based on the uses and gratifications theory, this paper aims to analyse how three basic motivations are related to the use of video game streaming platforms. Furthermore, it examines the moderating effects that significant variables, such as the audience members age, sex or self-perception of level as a player may exert on this relationship. The results reveal that the three types of motivations are positively associated with use of the platform, although notable differences appear, with informational motivations outweighing entertainment and social motivations. At the same time, no moderating effects on the results of the proposed model were found for the heterogeneity stemming from sex and age. Conversely, the influence of informational motivations on the use of these platforms is moderated by the self-perception of level as a player.","output":"Motivations for the Use of Video Game Streaming Platforms: The Moderating Effect of Sex, Age and Self-Perception of Level as a Player"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms.

Although authorities are aware of the problem, an effective solution eludes them as fraudsters use innovative swindling methods and continually change the target group. Using a nationwide survey conducted by Hiroshima University, Japan, in 2020, this study investigated the socioeconomic and psychological profiles of victims of trending and special financial fraud such as fictitious billing fraud, loan guarantee fraud, and refund fraud. It was found that financial fraud victims' profiles are dissimilar at the aggregate and specific levels. At the specific level, victim profiles were diverse, that is, in fictitious billing fraud, loan guarantee fraud, and refund fraud cases. Males, married, and financially less satisfied people were more often victims of fictitious billing fraud; less anxious people were more likely victims of loan guarantee fraud; and older, asset-holding, and less-income-generating respondents were found to be victims of refund fraud. Our results also show some commonalities in the victims' profiles. For example, financially less-literate people were found to be more likely victims of fictitious billing fraud and loan guarantee fraud. Finally, respondents who lived with their family, those who did not have careful buying habits, and those who suffer from bouts of loneliness were found to be common victims of all types of special financial fraud. The results of our study suggest that a one-size-fits-all policy cannot effectively combat financial fraud.","output":"Who Is Next?

This study highlights the complexity of the ethical landscape, relating particularly to the balances that need to be struck when allocating resources; when measuring and prioritizing outcomes; and when individual preferences are sought. OBJECTIVE: Health outcome prioritization is the ranking in order of desirability or importance of a set of disease-related objectives and their associated cost or risk.

METHODS: Narrative review of literature published since 2007, incorporating snowball sampling where necessary. We identified, thematized, and discussed key issues of ethical salience. RESULTS: Eight areas of ethical salience for outcome prioritization emerged: 1) Public health and distributive justice, 2) Scarcity of resources, 3) Heterogeneity and changing circumstances, 4) Knowledge of treatment, 5) Values and circumstances, 6) Conflicting priorities, 7) Communication, autonomy and caregiver issues, and 8) Disclosure of risk.

Most previous studies considered one-way trips, either getting ambulances to patients or transporting patients to hospitals. This research assesses spatiotemporal access to EMS at the shequ (the smallest administrative unit) level in Wuhan, China, attempting to fill a gap in literature by considering and comparing both trips in the evaluation of EMS access. METHODS: Two spatiotemporal access measures are adopted here: the proximity-based travel time obtained from online map services and the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E-2SFCA) which is a gravity-based model. First, the travel time is calculated for the two trips involved in one EMS journey: one is from the nearest EMS station to the scene (i.e. scene time interval (STI)) and the other is from the scene to the nearest hospital (i.e. transport time interval (TTI)). Then, the predicted travel time is incorporated into the E-2SFCA model to calculate the access measure considering the availability of the service provider as well as the population in need. For both access measures, the calculation is implemented for peak hours and off-peak hours. RESULTS: Both methods showed a marked decrease in EMS access during peak traffic hours, and differences in spatial patterns of ambulance and hospital access. About 73.9% of shequs can receive an ambulance or get to the nearest hospital within 10 min during off-peak periods, and this proportion decreases to about 45.5% for peak periods. Most shequs with good ambulance access but poor hospital access are in the south of the study area. In general, the central areas have better ambulance, hospital and overall access than peripheral areas, particularly during off-peak periods.

While surgical disconnection is considered as the favored management option, endovascular treatment has lately gained importance. We present a single institution experience of seven cases. METHOD A retrospective analysis was performed on the institutional patient database. Features analyzed were demographic details, symptoms, angioarchitecture, treatment course, angiographic results, procedural complications, and follow-up. RESULTS This study included seven patients. The age at presentation ranged from 5-67 years. Clinical symptomatology was as intracranial hemorrhage in 4 patients and headache, chemosis and seizures in one patient each. The fistulae were paramedian at the ACF base. All DAVFs were Cognard type 4. The arterial feeders were from the anterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery in all cases (bilateral in n = 5), frontal branches of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) (n = 6), and multiple ECA branches. The arterial route was the choice for access. Complete fistula obliteration was achieved in all but one patient. A traversed vein underwent rupture in one patient. One patient suffered postsurgical hemorrhage. No clinical or angiographic recurrence was noted. CONCLUSION The DAVFs of the ACF are inherently high-grade lesions. Transorbital ECA-ICA branch anastomoses may be recruited as feeders. They may be best managed by multidisciplinary means personalized on an angioarchitectural basis. Endovascular embolization is safe and efficacious when performed through a navigable feeder from the frontal division of the MMA, which according to our interpretation is in anastomosis with the anterior falcine branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery.","output":"Anterior Cranial Fossa Dural Arteriovenous Fistulae - Angioarchitecture and Intervention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus main protease (M(pro)) plays an essential role in the extensive proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and it is an important target for anti-SARS drug development.

Data on study characteristics, clinical characteristics during follow-up, the number of patients with prolonged GI symptoms, and total number of COVID-19 survivors were retrieved according to PRISMA guidelines. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The pooled prevalence of specific prolonged GI symptoms was calculated and the association between COVID-19 severity and the occurrence of prolonged GI symptoms was assessed if appropriate. Results: The global prevalence of prolonged nausea was 3.23% (95% CI: 0.54%C16.53%) among 527 COVID-19 survivors. Vomiting persisted in 93 of 2,238 COVID-19 survivors (3.19%, 95% CI: 1.62%C6.17%) and prolonged diarrhea was found in 34 of 1,073 survivors (4.12%, 95% CI: 1.07%C14.64%). A total of 156 patients among 2,238 COVID-19 survivors (4.41%, 95% CI: 1.91%C9.94%) complained of persistent decreased or loss of appetite.

CONCLUSION: The reduced number of cases of Lyme disease coincided with the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland in March 2020. Every year, the incidence of Lyme disease in Poland is at a similar level with a similar monthly increase. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the number of cases recorded, which could have catastrophic consequences for people who did not receive treatment in the right time.","output":"The Impact of a Pandemic COVID-19 on the Incidence of Borreliosis in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to public health on a global scale. As governments are scrambling to safeguard peoples health, the contagion has fast extended to the economic sphere, creating an international economic crisis, unique in the scale and characteristics not seen since the Great Depression. COVID-19, unleashed simultaneous global demand and supply shocks, spanning across all nodes and centers of economic activity across the world, as businesses shut down and consumers were confined to contain the contagion. With the global economy interconnected more than ever, the rate of cross-economic contagion is likely to take an unparalleled economic toll. Despite massive stimulus packages being crafted as economic lifelines in some developed economies, global income this year is likely to shrink dramatically with significant adverse transmission effects to developing and emerging markets. The vulnerability of developing countries to the pandemic is particularly acute, with limited capacity to weather the immediate health crisis and expected economic fallout due to high pre-existing poverty rates, larger informal sectors, shallower financial markets, and less fiscal space to broaden the social safety net or to stimulate their domestic economies. A protracted global depression threatens deep disruptive and lasting structural impact to their economies. The resulting risks, uncertainties, and threats to economic and social stability pose a threat to security, particularly in countries already suffering pre-pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Crisis: The Impact of Trade and Economic Contagion on Developing Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory virus infections in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients are a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

So far these efforts have led to clinical trials with different candidate treatments, with tolvaptan being the only molecule that has gained approval for this indication. As end-stage kidney disease due to ADPKD has a substantial impact on health expenditures worldwide, it is likely that new drugs targeting kidney function will be developed. On the other hand, recent clinical observations and experimental data, including PKD knockout models in various cell types, have revealed unexpected involvement of many other organs and cell systems of variable severity. These novel non-cystic features, some of which, such as lymphopenia and an increased risk to develop infections, should be validated or further explored and might open new avenues for better risk stratification and a more tailored approach. New insights into the aberrant pathways involved with abnormal expression of PKD gene products polycystin-1 and -2 could, for instance, lead to a more directed approach towards early-onset endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, a better understanding of cellular pathways in PKD that can explain the propensity to develop certain types of cancer can guide post-transplant immunosuppressive and prophylactic strategies. In the following review article we will systematically discuss recently discovered non-cystic features of PKD and not well-established characteristics. Overall, this knowledge could enable us to improve the outcome of PKD patients apart from ongoing efforts to slow down cyst growth and attenuate kidney function decline.","output":"Novel non-cystic features of polycystic kidney disease: having new eyes or seeking new landscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International food system initiatives have led the efforts to combat the threats to global food security resulting from the failure of the current food systems.

The major bottleneck of a phage display selection pipeline is the production of monoclonal antibody fragments for screening and further analysis. In this study, we describe the development of improved protocols for the production of single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments in 96-well microtitre plates (MTPs) in Escherichia coli. Four scFvs were expressed using the antibody expression vector pOPE101-XP to analyse the influence of a set of different parameters on their production. Further, six scFvs were expressed using the phage display vector pHAL14 to investigate the effect on the production of functional scFvs using those parameters that improved production from pOPE101-XP. Yield in MTPs was influenced by a variety of conditions and was also strongly dependent on the individual scFv clone. Although it was not possible to deduce a single set of optimal parameters applicable to all the tested scFvs, a combined protocol was developed which improved the expression of scFv fragments over standard methods.","output":"Improved microtitre plate production of single chain Fv fragments in Escherichia coli."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION While porcine-based biologic meshes are increasingly used for hernia repair, little data exist on tissue responses to such products. Host foreign body reaction, local inflammation, and wound healing are principally controlled by monocytes/macrophages (M/M?s). Exaggerated activation of M/M?s may deleteriously influence mesh integration and remodeling. We hypothesized that common porcine meshes induce the differential activation of M/M?s in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples of four acellular porcine-derived meshes, CollaMend (CM; C.R. Bard/Davol), Permacol (PC; TSL/Covidien), Strattice (ST; LifeCell), and Surgisis (SS; Cook Biotech), were exposed to mononuclear cells derived from the peripheral blood of six healthy subjects. Following a 7-day incubation period, supernatants were assayed for interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using a multiplex bead-based immunoassay system. The four groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test. RESULTS Each mesh type induced differential mononuclear cell activation in vitro. The mean IL-1beta expressions for CM (7,195 pg/ml) and PC (4,215 pg/ml) were significantly higher compared to ST and SS (123 and 998 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). Similar trends were also seen for IL-6 (range 445-70,729 pg/ml), IL-8 (range 11,640-1,045,938 pg/ml), and VEGF (range 686-7,133 pg/ml). CONCLUSION For the first time, we demonstrated that porcine meshes induce M/M? activation in vitro. CM and PC (chemically crosslinked dermis) induced significantly higher cytokine expression compared to ST (non-crosslinked dermis) and SS (small intestine submucosa). These differences are likely related to proprietary processing methods and/or the extent of collagen crosslinking. Further understanding of immunologic effects of porcine-derived biologic meshes will not only allow for a comparison between existing products, but it may also lead to mesh modifications and improvement of their clinical performance.","output":"Activation of human mononuclear cells by porcine biologic meshes in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Privacy and security of data are emerged as fundamental parts of routine clinical and laboratory practice The adoption of electronic medical record, the connectivity of information systems and instruments to Internet have increased the risk for violation of patients privacy The European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR 2016/679) defines how personal information must be used by adopting measures that guarantee high level of security Accordingly, transparency about the generation and managing of data in research became crucial The most important ethical issue document is represented by the informed consent, which can be signed by the donor to authorize the collection, storage and use of the samples and associated data for specific research purposes In May 2020, a screening for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 infection in all the patients and employees at the Santa Lucia Foundation, in Rome has been conducted, together with the voluntary opportunity for all the participants to donate biological materials for future researches for COVID-19 disease Materials: All participants were subjected to nasooropharyngeal swab test for viral SARS-CoV2 RNA detection, and blood sampling, for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment, in electrochemiluminescence immunoassay \\"ECLIA\\" (Roche) In addition, those who gave voluntary consent for donation to the Biobank, carried out an adjunctive tube for serum sample According to the GDPR, the informed consent form is divided into two parts: The first for the donation of samples to the biobank and the second for personal data treatment authorization, including i authorization to personal data processing, ii genetic data processing, iii transfer of biological samples and data to third parties in or iv outside Europe (Research Institute, University, other biobanks), and v consent to access to the electronic medical record Results: A total of 742 patients and personnel participated at the screening for COVID-19: 468 gave the consent for donation of biological sample to the Biobank, while 43 denied consent Among donors, 22 (4,7%) refused consent to the transfer/communication of biological samples/associated data to third parties in Europe while 35 (7,5%) denied the transfer/communication outside Europe Regarding the consent for the genetic data processing, only 5 participants (1,1%) refused authorization Conclusions: The fear of an uncontrolled dissemination of personal data, especially on internet or media, is one of the main reasons that preclude participation in research studies Donation of biological materials and data for biobanking expose patients and donors to risk of threatening of their privacy, but represent a great need for future of translational medicine Informed consent defines the authorizations for the processing of patient data and the possibility to withdraw at any time Finally, transparency and security are the pillars for the patients healthcare","output":"Samples Management and Data Protection through SARS-Cov2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing care for terminally ill cancer patients is routinely provided by oncology nurses in Saudi Arabia. Shortages and retention of oncology nurses is an important concern for healthcare leaders. OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe predictors of nurses intention toward working in the oncology specialty amongst three groups: undergraduate nursing students, oncology registered nurses and postgraduate oncology nursing students. In particular, the study sought to analyse association between individual characteristics, job-related factors, palliative care knowledge, attitude toward caring for dying patients, general self-efficacy, job satisfaction and intention to work in oncology. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 477 participants in five major hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The Palliative Care Quiz for Nursing, Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale and Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire short form were used for data collection. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors associated with intention to work in oncology. RESULTS: 43.9% (n = 208) of the sample reported an intention to work in oncology. Only one variable was a significant predictor of intention to work in oncology across all three groups studied: a more positive attitude toward caring for dying patients (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04C1.16]), (OR = 1.08 [95% CI 1.04C1.12]), (OR = 1.078 [95% CI 1.053C1.103] with P  0.001 for undergraduate, registered and postgraduate groups respectively. At post-graduate level, higher levels of palliative care knowledge and general self-efficacy were significantly associated with increased intention, whilst at undergraduate level, general self-efficacy was a significant predictor. Job satisfaction was a significant predictor of intention amongst registered nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Attitude toward caring for dying patients and general self-efficacy appear to be the most important predictors of intention to work in the oncology nursing specialty. However, the significance of influencing factors varied between the different groups of nurses studied. Perhaps surprisingly, palliative care knowledge was an influential factor amongst the postgraduate group only.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is known to reduce hospital readmissions when delivered after hospitalization, but the uptake and completion of PR following hospitalization remains poor (<10% of those eligible in the UK audit data). A web-based platform of the SPACE (Self-management Program of Activity Coping and Education) for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) has previously shown promising results in patients with stable COPD but has not been tested following an AECOPD. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based self-management program. METHODS: A nonrandomized feasibility study for patients with confirmed AECOPD who were deemed web literate was conducted. All patients consented during their hospitalization and received access to the website following discharge in addition to usual care. The program aims to facilitate patients to better understand and manage their condition through education and home-based exercises. Participants were asked to complete the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months. A total of 14 participants were also interviewed (n=8 completers; n=6 noncompleters) regarding their experiences with the web-based program and trial. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2080 patients were screened for eligibility, of which 100 patients (age: mean 71.2 years, SD 9.3 years; male: 55/100, 55%; forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio: mean 0.46, SD 0.14; pack-years: mean 50.2, SD 31.0; current smokers: 35/100, 35%) were recruited (4.8% of those screened). The main reason for ineligibility was a lack of web literacy (1366/1980, 68.98%). In total, 18% (18/100) of patients had completed the web program by 6 months, with others still registered in the program (27/100, 27%), and more than half did not register (55/100, 55%). There was a mean change in Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire scores at 6 months of 7.8 (SD 10.2) points. Qualitative interviews identified three main themes: preparing for, engagement with, and benefits of the study and program. A total of 57% (57/100) accepted a referral to PR on discharge and 19% (19/100) had completed the program after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the challenges of recruiting, retaining, and engaging participants in a web-based self-management program, it is not a feasible approach to roll out widely. This study acknowledges that this is a challenging time for patients with an AECOPD to engage in exercise and self-management education. However, for patients who were able to engage in such an intervention, the completion rate of PR was double the previous audit estimates from the United Kingdom, disease knowledge improved, and the intervention was of value to patients.

Most of the existing work on epidemiological models focuses on scenario-based forecasting via simulation but techniques for explicit control of epidemics via an analytical framework are largely missing. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the optimal policy for transmission control assuming SIR dynamics, which is the most widely used epidemiological paradigm. We first demonstrate that the SIR model with infectious patients and susceptible contacts (i.e., product of transmission rate and susceptible population) interpreted as predators and prey respectively reduces to a Lotka-Volterra (LV) predator-prey model. The modified SIR system (LVSIR) has a stable equilibrium point, an energy conservation property, and exhibits bounded cyclic behaviour similar to an LV system. This mapping permits a theoretical analysis of the control problem supporting some of the recent simulation-based studies that point to the benefits of periodic interventions. We use a control-Lyapunov approach to design adaptive control policies (CoSIR) to nudge the SIR model to the desired equilibrium that permits ready extensions to richer compartmental models. We also describe a practical implementation of this transmission control method by approximating the ideal control with a finite, but a time-varying set of restriction levels and provide simulation results to demonstrate its efficacy.","output":"CoSIR: Managing an Epidemic via Optimal Adaptive Control of Transmission Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibody to SARS-CoV-2 is under investigation for COVID-19 treatment. We report diverse virological characteristics of UK intensive care patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial that potentially influence treatment outcomes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs collected pre-treatment was quantified by PCR. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains using allele-specific probes or restriction site polymorphism (SfcI) targeting D1118H. RESULTS: Of 1274 subjects, 90% were PCR-positive with viral loads 118-1.7x10 11 IU/ml. Median viral loads were 40-fold higher in those seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=354; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=939; 72%). Frequencies of B.1.1.7 increased from <1% in early November, 2020 to 82% of subjects in January 2021. Seronegative individuals with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians 5.8x10 6 and 2.0 x10 5 IU/ml respectively; p=2x10 -15). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seronegative and seropositive subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (4.0x10 6 and 1.6x10 6 IU/ml respectively).

The immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA) is widely used in patients with organ transplantation or autoimmune diseases, and it has a good safety profile in pregnant women. However, high-quality evidence for CsA treatment of URSAs is lacking.

The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), occurring during a regulated form of neutrophil cell death known as NETosis, is a key effector function that mediates harmful effects caused by neutrophils. Abundant NETosis and NET generation have been observed in the neutrophils of many COVID-19 patients, leading to unfavorable coagulopathy and immunothrombosis.

Each hospital reported the number of EGS procedures in the same time frame comparing 2019 and 2020. The survey revealed that the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 was reduced by 19% when compared with 2019.

CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons 'decision making' process.

In the U.S.A., some governing bodies have already weakened or repealed guidelines for nonpharmaceutical intervention use, despite a recent spike in national COVID-19 cases and majority population of unvaccinated individuals. Recent modeling suggests that repealing nonpharmaceutical intervention guidelines too early into vaccine rollouts will lead to localized increases in COVID-19 cases, but the magnitude of nonpharmaceutical intervention effects on individual-level SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in fully- and partially-vaccinated populations is unclear. We use a previously-published agent-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor gatherings of varying durations, population densities, and vaccination coverage levels. By simulating nonpharmaceutical interventions in some gatherings but not others, we were able to quantify the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk when nonpharmaceutical interventions were used, relative to scenarios with no nonpharmaceutical interventions. We found that nonpharmaceutical interventions will often reduce secondary attack rates, especially during brief interactions, and therefore there is no definitive vaccination coverage level that makes nonpharmaceutical interventions completely redundant. However, the reduction effect on absolute SARS-CoV-2 infection risk conferred by nonpharmaceutical interventions is likely proportional to COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, if COVID-19 prevalence decreases in the future, nonpharmaceutical interventions will likely still confer protective effects but potential benefits may be small enough to remain within effectively negligible risk thresholds.","output":"When can we stop wearing masks?

This model aims to quickly cap the epidemics curve instead of traditional flattening. We have documented empirical evidence for this new conceptualization.Methods: Data regarding daily incidences and fatalities from the outbreak to 12 August 2020 were collected from nine countries that had reported their outbreak before 01 February 2020. Each countrys epidemic curve was characterised by its peak height (peak incidence), time to peak (TTP), and cumulative incidence (CI). It was hypothesised that a quicker TTP is associated with a lower peak incidence, lower CI, and lower case-fatality when the epidemic curves are capped instead of being flattened.Results: Since the outbreak, China and South Korea have had the two quickest TTPs of 4070 and 4537 days, respectively, and the lowest peak incidences of 295 and 465 cases per day respectively. Meanwhile, Sweden known for its laissez-faire approach to dealing with the epidemic had the longest TTP (12036 days) and the highest peak incidence (27974 days). Quicker TTPs were correlated with lower peak incidences ( = 0896, p = 00026) and with lower CIs (0864, p = 00056), which supports the hypothesis.Conclusions: Overall, the multiple nations concerned had implemented a tech-powered approach to cap the epidemic curve.

While vaccines have proven instrumental in fighting SARS-CoV-2, their efficacy is challenged by vaccine hesitancy, novel variants and short-lasting immunity. Therefore, understanding and optimization of therapeutic options remains essential. ObjectivesWe aimed at generating a deeper understanding on how currently used drugs, specifically dexamethasone and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses. Possible synergistic effects of both substances are investigated to evaluate combinatorial treatments. MethodsBy using two COVID-19 hamster models, pulmonary immune responses were analyzed to characterize effects of treatment with either dexamethasone, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody or a combination of both. scRNA sequencing was employed to reveal transcriptional response to treatment on a single cell level. Measurements and main resultsDexamethasone treatment resulted in similar or increased viral loads compared to controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment alone or combined with dexamethasone successfully reduced pulmonary viral burden. Dexamethasone exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects and prevented fulminant disease in a severe COVID-19-like disease model. Combination therapy showed additive benefits with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory potency. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed dampened inflammatory cell recruitment into lungs upon dexamethasone treatment and identified a candidate subpopulation of neutrophils specifically responsive to dexamethasone. ConclusionsOur analyses i) confirm the anti-inflammatory properties and indicate possible modes of action for dexamethasone, ii) validate anti-viral effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatment, and iii) reveal synergistic effects of a combination therapy and can thus inform more effective COVID-19 therapies.","output":"Insights into standards of care: dexamethasone and antibodies against COVID-19 in hamster models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) remains a difficult-to-treat infection. Considering the poor lung penetration of most antibiotics, the choice of the better antibiotic regimen is debated. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from January 2017 to June 2020. All consecutive hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia due to MDR-AB were included in the study. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate risk factors associated with survival or death at 30 days from pneumonia onset. A propensity score for receiving therapy with fosfomycin was added to the model. RESULTS: During the study period, 180 cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, caused by MDR-AB strains were observed. Cox regression analysis of factors associated with 30-day mortality, after propensity score, showed that septic shock, and secondary bacteremia were associated with death, while a fosfomycin-containing regimen was associated with 30-day survival. Antibiotic combinations with fosfomycin in definitive therapy for 44 patients were: fosfomycin + colistin in 11 (25%) patients followed by fosfomycin + carbapenem + tigecycline in 8 (18.2%), fosfomycin + colistin + tigecycline in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + rifampin in 7 (15.9%), fosfomycin + tigecycline in 6 (13.6%), fosfomycin + carbapenem in 3 (6.8%), and fosfomycin + aminoglycoside in 2 (4.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This real-life clinical experience concerning the therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia caused by MDR-AB provides useful suggestions to clinicians, showing the use of different antibiotic regimens with a predominant role for fosfomycin.

The authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic could stymie progress toward gender parity within the biomedical workforce and limit the retention and advancement of women in science and medicine. Women faculty face distinct challenges as they navigate the impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing on work and home life. An unequal division of household labor and family care between men and women means women faculty are vulnerable to inequities that may develop in the workplace as they strive to maintain academic productivity and professional development without adequate assistance with domestic tasks and family care. Emerging data suggest that gender differences in academic productivity may be forthcoming as a direct result of the pandemic. Existing gender inequities in professional visibility, networking, and collaboration may be exacerbated as activities transition from in-person to virtual environments and create new barriers to advancement. Meanwhile, initiatives designed to promote gender equity within academic medicine may lose key funding due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on higher education. To ensure that the gender gap within academic medicine does not widen, the authors call upon academic leaders and the broader biomedical community to support women faculty through deliberate actions that promote gender equity, diversity, and inclusion. The authors provide several recommendations, including faculty needs assessments; review of gender bias within tenure-clock-extension offers; more opportunities for mentorship, sponsorship, and professional recognition; and financial commitments to support equity initiatives. Leadership for these efforts should be at the institutional and departmental levels, and leaders should ensure a gender balance on task forces and committees to avoid overburdening women faculty with additional service work.

We combined the geospatial analysis with publicly available databases to assess the integrated climate-related impacts pertaining to a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) economy. Our study estimated that many tourism properties currently lie in a storm surge zone and the extent of properties at risk increases with a future scenario of a 1 m rise in sea level. While sea level rise (SLR) by itself only threatens a small number of properties, when combined with weak (Category 1), moderate (Category 3) and strong (Category 5) storms the resulting coastal flooding impacts 34%, 69%, and 83% of the tourism infrastructure (hotels and resorts), respectively. In addition to flooding, properties are also susceptible to coastal erosion with 28% of the total hotels and resorts on the two islands being situated within 0C50 m and 60% of the tourism infrastructure within 0C100 m of the coastline. Considering the economic importance of the sector, the potential impacts on the tourism infrastructure will cause significant losses in revenue and employment for the two islands. Furthermore, the majority of the tourism on these islands is beach-based and visitor expenditures will decline due to their vulnerability. These losses will have far-reaching social-economic consequences for the Bahamas.

This paper shares a protocol for a mixed methods study that aims to understand: the profile and history of service users described as having complex needs; the decision-making processes by clinicians that lead to complex needs categorisation; service users and carers experience of service use; and, associated economic impact. This protocol describes a comprehensive evaluation that aims to inform an evidence-based service delivery model for people with complex needs. METHODS: We will use a mixed methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative methods using in-depth descriptive and inferential analysis of patient records, written medical notes and in-depth interviews with service users, carers, and clinicians. The study will include five components: (1) a quantitative description and analysis of the demographic clinical characteristics of the patient group; (2) an economic evaluation of alternative patient pathways; (3) semi-structured interviews about service user and carer experiences; (4) using data from components 1C3 to co-produce vignettes jointly with relevant stakeholders involved in the care of service users with complex mental health needs; and, (5) semi-structured interviews about clinical decision-making by clinicians in relation to this patient group, using the vignettes as example case studies.

Their acceptance and safety have not been addressed on healthcare workers. The aim of the present study is to evaluate vaccination rates and side effects among Spanish nephrologists. METHODS: All the Spanish nephrologists were invited to participate in this survey. Data on demographics, Covid-19 infection status, received vaccine doses and side effects were collected. Acceptance and side effects were analyzed for Covid-19 vaccination. Factors associated to vaccination were assessed and a multivariate adjusted model was constructed to determine independent predictors for Covid-19 vaccine side effects. RESULTS: A total of 708 nephrologists answered the survey (460 [65%] women, mean age 4411 years). Six-hundred and eight (86%) had received the first dose and 513 (72%) were fully vaccinated. Most of the subjects (565, 93%) received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech?) vaccine. Among vaccinated nephrologists, 453 (75%) presented any side effect; the most frequent was local reaction (68%), followed by myalgia (44%), tiredness (39%) and headache (34%). Age (OR 0.97, 95%CI [0.95-0.99], p<0.0001) and prior Covid-19 infection (OR 2.37, 95%CI [1.27-4.42], p=0.007) were independent predictors for developing side effects with Covid-19 vaccine. Overall side effects were similar with both vaccines, being myalgia (p=0.006) and tiredness (p=0.032) more frequent with the Pfizer-BioNTech? one.

We expressed the NS5B protein in Escherichia coli. The rGTP can stimulate de novo initiation of RNA synthesis and mutation of the GDD motif to GlyCAspCAsp (GAA) abolishes the RNA synthesis. To better understand the mechanism of viral RNA synthesis in CSFV, a three-dimensional model was built by homology modeling based on the alignment with several virus RdRps. The model contains 605 residues folded in the characteristic fingers, palm and thumb domains. The fingers domain contains an N-terminal region that plays an important role in conformational change. We propose that the experimentally observed promotion of polymerase efficiency by rGTP is probably due to the conformational changes of the polymerase caused by binding the rGTP. Mutation of the GDD to GAA interferes with the interaction between the residues at the polymerase active site and metal ions, and thus renders the polymerase inactive.","output":"De novo RNA synthesis and homology modeling of the classical swine fever virus RNA polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as synaptic scaling are critically dependent on transcription.

Objective To explore the relationship between emotional responses and coping strategies used to face the first confinement among the Mexican adult population and inquire about differences by sex. Method An exploratory study was conducted through a self-administered online survey. It included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, emotions about pandemic information, and coping strategies. An informed consent form was presented prior to data collection. Chi square and Kruskal-Wallis were performed for bivariate analyses. Results A total of 2,650 participants completed the survey (21.6% were men). Significantly more men than women reported feeling calm (p &lt; .001), hopeful (p = .011), and indifferent (p = .002). In contrast, more women, compared to men significantly reported feeling worried (p &lt; .001), fearful (p &lt; 0.001), and sad (p &lt; .001). More women reported being emotionally close to other people (p = .027), seeking help from friends and family to share emotions and concerns (p &lt; .001), and they frequently prayed as a coping strategy regardless of their emotions (p = .005). Discussion and conclusion While women are the least affected by the contagion and their symptoms are milder than in men, they present the most negative emotions, particularly of worry, but they also used more caring and helpful behaviors in comparison with men.

Background: During the unprecedented era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of countries worldwide adopted very strong measures. Universities closed their doors, and education continued through digital learning lectures. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all 189 eligible candidates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health was assessed via the MH domain of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout InventoryStudent Survey (MBI-SS). Results: The overall response rate was 81.5%. The overall burnout prevalence did not differ significantly between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 18.1% vs. COVID-19 18.2%). However, the burnout prevalence dropped significantly in year 4 (pre-COVID-19 40.7% vs. COVID-19 16.7%, p = 0.011), whereas it increased significantly in year 6 (pre-COVID-19 27.6% vs. COVID-19 50%, p = 0.01). When looking at each MBI-SS dimension separately, we found that emotional exhaustion decreased significantly in year 4 but increased in year 6, and cynicism increased in all years.

The mechanism of initiation of neuroinflammation during SAE, which ultimately leads to delirium and cognitive dysfunction, remains elusive. We aimed to study the molecular events of SAE to capture its onset and progression into the central nervous system (CNS), and further identify the cellular players involved in mediating acute inflammatory signaling. Gene expression profiling on the cerebral vessels isolated from the brains of the mice treated with peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed that the cerebral vasculature responds within minutes to acute systemic inflammation by upregulating the expression of immediate early response genes, followed by activation of the nuclear factor-B pathway. To identify the earliest responding cell type, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort the glial and vascular cells from the brains of the mice treated with LPS at different time points, and RNA-seq was performed on microglia and cerebral endothelial cells (CECs). Bioinformatic analysis followed by further validation in all the cell types revealed that panendothelitis. i.e., the activation of CECs is the earliest event in the CNS during the inception of acute neuroinflammation. Microglial activation occurs later than that of CECs, suggesting that CECs are the most likely initial source of proinflammatory mediators, which could further initiate glial cell activation. This is then followed by the activation of apoptotic signaling in the CECs, which is known to lead to the bloodCbrain barrier disruption and allow peripheral cytokines to leak into the CNS, exacerbate the gliosis, and result in the vicious neuroinflammatory cascade. Together, our results model the earliest sequential events during the advancement of systemic inflammation into the CNS and facilitate to understand the interplay between the vascular and glial cells in initiating and driving acute neuroinflammation during SAE.","output":"Temporal unsnarling of brains acute neuroinflammatory transcriptional profiles reveals panendothelitis as the earliest event preceding microgliosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence of cardiovascular complications associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve These include direct and indirect myocardial injury with subsequent acute myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrhythmia Some results from a limited number of trials of antiviral medications, along with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been beneficial However, these pharmacotherapies may cause drug-induced QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death Mitigation of the potential risk in these susceptible patients may prove exceptionally challenging The Saudi Heart Rhythm Society established a task force to perform a review of this subject based on has recently published reports, and studies and recommendations from major medical organizations The objective of this review is to identify high-risk patients, and to set clear guidelines for management of patients receiving these pharmacotherapies","output":"Saudi Heart Rhythm Society Task Force on Management of Potential Arrhythmogenicity Associated with Pharmacotherapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate dental students perceptions and concerns regarding the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, their coping strategies and support resources, and their perceived stress levels.

Home confinement and social distancing could have negatively impacted sleep habits and prevalence of sleep disorders in children, which may be also linked with altered emotional processes. The present study focused on clinical aspects related to sleep, insomnia and emotions in Italian children aged 0-to-12 years during home confinement due to COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: An online survey was systematically distributed in all Italian territories by contacting regional offices of the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (MIUR) and schools with available contact. All respondents had to be parents of at least one child aged 0 to 12 years old. Information on sociodemographic variables, sleep habits, sleep health behaviors, sleep disorders and mood were collected. RESULTS: Parents of 2361 children (mean age: 8.1  2.62 years; 1148 females; 1213 males) answered the survey. 1.2% of children was between 0 and 2 years old; 15.3% within 3 to 5 years and 83.3% within 6 and 12 years. In all group ages, late bedtime was observed (most of them after 9 p.m.). 59.4% of all children presented at least one clinical diagnostic criterion for childhood insomnia.

If left untreated, they can cause testicular tissue damage and infertility. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice allowing for non-invasive diagnosis provided that characteristic features are seen. In recent times, magnetic resonance imaging characteristics have also been described to aid diagnosis. Case Report: This case describes the imaging features of multiple bilateral TART in a young patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Traditional greyscale and colour Doppler ultrasound demonstrated intratesticular, predominantly hypoechoic areas, with increased surrounding colour Doppler flow. In addition, contrast-enhanced ultrasound and strain elastography were performed, showing increased TART vascularisation and increased stiffness in the hypoechoic areas. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging confirmed bilateral lobulated, well demarcated, intratesticular lesions, which appeared predominantly isointense on T1-weighted imaging, hypointense on T2-weighted imaging, with heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration. Discussion: This case illustrates the sonographic features including greyscale, colour Doppler, contrast and elastography ultrasound of TART in a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Both contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastography can provide information about tissue properties not normally derived from conventional ultrasound and aid accurate diagnosis. Additional magnetic resonance imaging is not normally required with typical ultrasound appearances. The unusual findings seen on the ultrasound examination were likely secondary to poor compliance with treatment.

However, studies have shown associations between suboptimal dosing or interruptions to therapy and adverse clinical events. Therefore, effective treatments for hyperkalaemia that can enable optimal RAASi therapy are needed. This case series examines eight patients whose commencement on the novel potassium binder sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) allowed for the initiation and/or up-titration of RAASi therapy. CASE SUMMARY: Eight patients aged 64C87 years with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction all developed hyperkalaemia (serum potassium (sK(+)) >5.0 mmol/L) while receiving RAASi therapy. Following initiation of SZC, all patients experienced eventual stabilization of sK(+) levels. All patients were able to initiate, restart, or up-titrate RAASi therapy with five patients achieving optimal medical therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved in four patients, two patients are now re-classified as New York Heart Association Class I, and an additional patient had improved exercise tolerance. Follow-up for Patient 8 is still ongoing. DISCUSSION: These real-world cases demonstrate that use of SZC to manage hyperkalaemia in patients with HF is feasible and allows optimization of RAASi therapy.","output":"Use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for up-titration of reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) receptors are involved in the regulation of immune responses, autoimmunity, and allergy. Structures of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the murine mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors revealed an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, with four Cys residues bridging a distinctive CC loop to the GFC -sheet. The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding. Biochemical, mutational, and cell adhesion analyses confirmed the divergent ligand-binding modes revealed by the structures. Structural features characteristic of mTIM-1 appear conserved in human TIM-1, which also mediated homophilic interactions. The extracellular mucin domain enhanced binding through the Ig domain, modulating TIM receptor functions. These results explain the divergent immune functions described for the murine receptors and the role of TIM-1 as a cell adhesion receptor in renal regeneration and cancer.","output":"Structures of T Cell Immunoglobulin Mucin Receptors 1 and 2 Reveal Mechanisms for Regulation of Immune Responses by the TIM Receptor Family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"General well-being is best described as the state of mind that gives people happiness and satisfaction in life.

Humans express two types of defensins, - and -defensins, which have antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. The diversity of defensin-sensitive viral species reflects a multitude of antiviral mechanisms. These include direct defensin targeting of viral envelopes, glycoproteins, and capsids in addition to inhibition of viral fusion and post-entry neutralization. Binding and modulation of host cell surface receptors and disruption of intracellular signaling by defensins can also inhibit viral replication. In addition, defensins can function as chemokines to augment and alter adaptive immune responses, revealing an indirect antiviral mechanism. Nonetheless, many questions regarding the antiviral activities of defensins remain. Although significant mechanistic data is known for -defensins, molecular details for -defensin inhibition are mostly lacking. Importantly, the role of defensin antiviral activity in vivo has not been addressed due to the lack of a complete defensin knockout model. Overall, the antiviral activity of defensins is well established as are the variety of mechanisms by which defensins achieve this inhibition; however, additional research is needed to fully understand the role of defensins in viral pathogenesis.","output":"Antiviral Mechanisms of Human Defensins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indirect molecular diagnosis of hemophiliaA (HA) is carried out by analyzing intragenic polymorphic markers described along the coagulation factorVIII (FVIII) gene.

Two extragenic markers closely linked to FVIII (DXS1073 and DXS1108) have also been described as valuable tools for gene tracking. The objective of the present work was to develop a rapid, single-tube automated method to simultaneously analyze these four STRs. Consistent amplification was achieved by quadruplex fluorescent PCR and the products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Validation of the method included DNA analysis of 88 individuals from a control population, 45 HA patients and 32 individuals from 10 HA-affected families. Statistical study showed that the STR13, STR22 and DXS1108 loci were in significant linkage disequilibrium, whereas DXS1073 was not. Nevertheless, the combination of the four markers offered a high heterozygosity rate (>90%) that improved tracing of FVIII gene inheritance. Optimal results with application to single cells in a HA preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) protocol demonstrated the sensitivity of the technique.

We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of anxiety and stress severity among the Palestinian population.MethodsA cross-sectional web-based survey throughout the social media on internet was conducted. An anonymous online questionnaire and snowball recruiting technique were used to target the general public in Palestine during the lockdowns of COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected between 6- 16 April 2020 which corresponded to almost the middle interval of the strict massive lockdown measures in Palestine started 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed for the outcome variables (stress and anxiety severity).ResultsAbout 2819 individuals completed the questionnaire. The mean (range) age was 29.47 (18-71) years. Anxiety prevalence was 25.15%, with 20.08% as mild/moderate anxiety. The prevalence of stress was 38.77% with 22.21% had mild/moderate stress. The prevalence of both anxiety and stress was 20.3% among participants. Males were less likely to have mild\\\\moderate degree or sever\\\\extremely sever degree of stress compared to females. Shortage of food supply, those having high-risk group family member, those who considered conversation with other people as source of information and those reporting higher fear of being infected were more likely to have higher degree of stress and/or anxiety compared to normal. Those with a monthly income of less than 2000 New Israeli Shekels (<555 USD) were significantly more likely to have mild/moderate stress compared to normal and higher monthly incomes. Gaza residency also shows significant negative predictor of stress severity compared to West Bank and Jerusalem. ConclusionsThis study reported high rates of anxiety and stress among the Palestinian general population during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.

Although the potential to further develop this technology is clear, the limitations of commercially available devices are poorly understood. This systematic review examines the current utilisation of advanced bipolar RF fusion technology for non-vascular applications in thoracic and abdominal tissues and organs. METHODS Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library databases were searched. Studies examining the non-vascular application of advanced bipolar RF technology in the abdomen and thorax were assessed. Measurement of seal sufficiency and the extent of tissue injury induced by bipolar RF energy application were the main outcomes of interest. RESULTS Forty-six animal and human studies conducted in and ex vivo across a range of tissue types, met the inclusion criteria. The diversity of study protocols together with the heterogeneity of their outcomes prevented pooled analysis. However, the experimental animal studies assessed suggest that bipolar RF fusion devices are capable of effectively sealing most tissue types with the notable exception of large caliber bronchi (>4 mm) and bile ducts, where the rate of seal failure was unacceptably high. Human studies were additionally found to predominantly use bipolar RF technology as a means of parenchymal and ductal occlusion. A similar trend was seen amongst animal studies with only a handful of papers examining bipolar RF energy use for (bowel) anastomosis. CONCLUSION Bipolar RF fusion devices are capable of safely sealing a variety of thoracic and anterior abdominal tissues with an injury and leakage profile comparable to established technologies. Although thermal monitoring is increasingly sophisticated and multimodal, consistent real time tracking of a multitude of parameters is necessary in order to expand RF fusion technology utilisation to complete an array of tasks such as vessel ligation, ductal obliteration and anastomosis in the open and laparoscopic environments.","output":"Non-vascular experimental and clinical applications of advanced bipolar radiofrequency thermofusion technology in the thorax and abdomen: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many ways to approach and analyze juridical terminology.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it was especially important to save operating room resources and to have a shorter ICU stay for patients, when ICUs had insufficient beds. In this context of limited resources, early percutaneous tracheostomy could be an effective way to manage mechanically ventilated patients. Nevertheless, current recommendations suggest delaying or avoiding the tracheotomy in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Aim of the study was to analyze the hospital mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 patients who had received early percutaneous tracheostomy and factors associated with removal of tracheostomy cannula at ICU discharge. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Coronavirus disease 2019 ICU. PATIENTS: Adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 3 days after ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three days after ICU admission, 164 patients were present in ICU and included in the analysis. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (74%) were tracheostomized, whereas the other 43 (26%) were managed with translaryngeal intubation only. In multivariable analysis, early percutaneous tracheostomy was associated with lower hospital mortality. Sixty-six of tracheostomized patients (55%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Age and male sex were the only characteristics that were independently associated with mortality in the tracheostomized patients (45.5% and 62.8% in tracheostomized and nontracheostomized patients, respectively; p = 0.009). Tracheostomy tube was removed in 47 of the tracheostomized patients (71%). The only variable independently associated with weaning from tracheostomy at ICU discharge was a faster start of spontaneous breathing after tracheotomy was performed.

In resistant C57BL/6 mice, CVB3 myocarditis is abrogated by T-cell-dependent mechanisms, whereas major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched permissive A.BY/SnJ mice develop chronic myocarditis based on virus persistence. To define the role of T-cell-priming dendritic cells (DCs) in the outcome of CVB3 myocarditis, DCs were analyzed in this animal model in the course of CVB3 infection. In both mouse strains, DCs were found to be infectible with CVB3; however, formation of infectious virions was impaired. In DCs derived from C57BL/6 mice, significantly higher quantities of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured compared to those from A.BY/SnJ mice. Additionally, the chemokines interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES were secreted by DCs from resistant C57BL/6 mice earlier in infection and at significantly higher levels. The protective role of IP-10 in CVB3 myocarditis was confirmed in IP-10(-/-) mice, which had increased myocardial injury compared to the immunocompetent control animals. Also, major differences in resistant and permissive mice were found in DC subsets, with C57BL/6 mice harboring more cross-priming CD4(-) CD8(+) DCs. As CD4(-) CD8(+) DCs are known to express 10 times more Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) than other DC subsets, we followed the course of CVB3 infection in TLR3(-/-) mice. These mice developed a fulminant acute myocarditis and secreted sustained low amounts of type I interferons; secretion of IP-10 and RANTES was nearly abrogated in DCs. We conclude that MHC-independent genetic factors involving DC-related IP-10 secretion and TLR3 expression are beneficial in the prevention of chronic coxsackievirus myocarditis.","output":"Effective chemokine secretion by dendritic cells and expansion of cross-presenting CD4-/CD8+ dendritic cells define a protective phenotype in the mouse model of coxsackievirus myocarditis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA is central to the COVID-19 pandemic-it shapes how the SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) behaves, and how researchers investigate and fight it.

MethodsAntibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and induction of antigen-specific B and CD4/CD8 T cell subsets were studied in 19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients receiving RTX, 12 RA patients on other therapies and 30 healthy controls after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either mRNA or vector based vaccines. ResultsA minimum of 10 B cells/{micro}L in the peripheral circulation was necessary in RTX patients to mount seroconversion to anti-S1 IgG upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. RTX patients lacking IgG seroconversion showed reduced antigen-specific B cells, lower frequency of TfH-like cells as well as less activated CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to IgG seroconverted RTX patients. Functionally relevant B cell depletion resulted in impaired IFN{gamma} secretion by spike-specific CD4 T cells.

Here, we tested this hypothesis using Stat1-/- mice, which lack the ability to mount Th1 immune responses. Infection of Stat1-/- mice with rhesus rotavirus type A (RRV) on postnatal day 1 induced a prominent Th2 response, duct epithelial injury and obstruction within 7 days, and atresia shortly thereafter. A high degree of phosphorylation of the Th2 transcription factor Stat6 was observed; however, concurrent inactivation of Stat1 and Stat6 in mice did not prevent BA after RRV infection. In contrast, depletion of macrophages or combined loss of Il13 and Stat1 reduced tissue infiltration by lymphocytes and myeloid cells, maintained epithelial integrity, and prevented duct obstruction. In concordance with our mouse model, humans at the time of BA diagnosis exhibited differential hepatic expression of Th2 genes and serum Th2 cytokines.

RESULTS: Being unemployed and having problems looking for work at age 21 years was associated with odds of psychological distress that were 2.48 (95% CI 1.95 to 3.14) times higher than employment. There was little evidence for additive effect measure modification of this association by disability status (2.52, 95% CI -1.21 to 6.25). CONCLUSIONS: Young people who were unemployed and having problems looking for work had increased odds of poor mental health. Interventions should focus on addressing the difficulties young people report when looking for work, with a particular focus on supporting those young people facing additional barriers to employment such as young people with disabilities.","output":"Does disability modify the relationship between labour force status and psychological distress among young people?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a large number of countries introduced a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Whereas the policies are similar across countries, country characteristics vary substantially. We examine the effectiveness of such policies using a cross-country variation in socio-economic, environmental and geographic, and health system dimensions. The effectiveness of policies that prescribe closures of schools and workplaces is declining with population density, country surface area, employment rate and proportion of elderly in the population; and increasing with GDP per capita and health expenditure. Cross-country human mobility data reinforce some of these results. We argue that the findings can be explained by behavioural response to risk perceptions and resource constraints. Voluntary practice of social distancing might be less prevalent in communities with lower perceived risk, associated with better access to health care and smaller proportion of elderly population. Higher population density, larger geographical area, and higher employment rate may require more resources to ensure compliance with lockdown policies.","output":"COVID-19: The impact of social distancing policies, cross-country analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During a novel virus pandemic, predicting emergency department (ED) volume is crucial for arranging the limited medical resources of hospitals for balancing the daily patient- and epidemic-related tasks in EDs. The goal of the current study was to detect specific patterns of change in ED volume and severity during a pandemic which would help to arrange medical staff and utilize facilities and resources in EDs in advance in the event of a future pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the patients who visited our ED between November 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020. We evaluated the change in ED patient volume and complexity of patients in our medical record system. Patient volume and severity during various periods were identified and compared with data from the past 3 years and the period that SARS occurred. RESULTS: A reduction in ED volume was evident. The reduction began during the early epidemic period and increased rapidly during the peak period of the epidemic with the reduction continuing during the late epidemic period. No significant difference existed in the percentages of triage levels 1 and 2 between the periods. The admission rate, length of stay in the ED, and average number of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest increased during the epidemic periods. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in ED volume during the COVID-19 pandemic was noted and a predictable pattern was found. This specific change in pattern in the ED volume may be useful for performing adjustments in EDs in the future during a novel virus pandemic. The severity of patients visiting the ED during epidemic periods was inconclusive.","output":"Prediction of emergency department volume and severity during a novel virus pandemic: Experience from the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human osteoblasts are multifunctional bone cells, which play essential roles in bone formation, angiogenesis regulation, as well as maintenance of hematopoiesis. However, the categorization of primary osteoblast subtypes in vivo in humans has not yet been achieved. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to perform a systematic cellular taxonomy dissection of freshly isolated human osteoblasts from one 31-year-old male with osteoarthritis and osteopenia after hip replacement. Based on the gene expression patterns and cell lineage reconstruction, we identified three distinct cell clusters including preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and an undetermined rare osteoblast subpopulation. This novel subtype was found to be the major source of the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 and 2 (NR4A1 and NR4A2) in primary osteoblasts, and the expression of NR4A1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on mouse osteoblasts in vivo. Trajectory inference analysis suggested that the undetermined cluster, together with the preosteoblasts, are involved in the regulation of osteoblastogenesis and also give rise to mature osteoblasts. Investigation of the biological processes and signaling pathways enriched in each subpopulation revealed that in addition to bone formation, preosteoblasts and undetermined osteoblasts may also regulate both angiogenesis and hemopoiesis. Finally, we demonstrated that there are systematic differences between the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse osteoblasts, highlighting the necessity for studying bone physiological processes in humans rather than solely relying on mouse models. Our findings provide novel insights into the cellular heterogeneity and potential biological functions of human primary osteoblasts at the single-cell level.","output":"A systematic dissection of human primary osteoblasts in vivo at single-cell resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Highlight examples of pediatric oncology nursing's accomplishments during the past 2 decades with attention to specialized practice, patient/family education, research/evidence-based practice, and advocacy and how these efforts can be leveraged to reduce disparities in the cure and care of children and adolescents with cancer.

In advance of effective antiviral therapies, countries have applied different public-health strategies to control spread and manage healthcare need. Sweden has taken a unique approach of not implementing strict closures, instead urging personal responsibility. We analyze the results of this and other potential strategies for pandemic control in Sweden. METHODS: We implemented individual-based modeling of COVID-19 spread in Sweden using population, employment, and household data. Epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 were validated on a limited date range; where substantial uncertainties remained, multiple parameters were tested. The effects of different public-health strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on ICU demand and death rate, and compared to Swedish data for April 2020. RESULTS: Swedish mortality rates fall intermediate between European countries that quickly imposed stringent public-health controls and countries that acted later. Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate. Swedish ICU utilization rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients. This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted. CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates. However, this policy causes more healthcare demand and mortality than early stringent control and depends on continued public will.","output":"Managing COVID-19 spread with voluntary public-health measures: Sweden as a case study for pandemic control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Total pancreatectomy (TP) is a morbid but sometimes necessary operation. Robotic TP is not often reported but may harbor some advantages compared to the open approach. This manuscript details a single institution's outcomes and technique of robotic TP. An accompanying video demonstrates a robotic TP with auto islet cell transplantation (IAT) in which (1) the arterial blood supply and venous drainage are kept intact until the last step of the TP to minimize warm ischemia time and (2) extirpation of the entire pancreas is performed without dividing the pancreatic neck to maximize islet recovery. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a prospective database of perioperative outcomes of all consecutive robotic TPs at a single institution. This included a single robotic TP with IAT performed on a twenty-year-old patient with chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS Between 2010 and January 2014, ten robotic TPs were performed (7 males, mean age 58 years), one of which included an IAT. Median body mass index was 28. Indications were intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (6), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (1), and chronic pancreatitis (3). The median operative time was 560 min with a median estimated blood loss of 650 ml. One case was converted to laparotomy. Ninety days mortality and Clavien III-IV complication rate were 0 and 20 %, respectively. The average length of stay was 10  3 days, with only 1 readmission within 90 days. The single TP and IAT were completed successfully without conversion, and were achieved without division of the pancreatic neck thereby maintaining vascular inflow to an entire specimen up until extraction. CONCLUSION This represents the largest series of robotic TP, demonstrating its safety and feasibility.

During past epidemics of SARS and MERS pneumomediastinum (PNM) and pneumothorax (PNX) were common complications (respectively 1.7-12% and 16,4%) either spontaneous or associated to ventilation. Methods: Aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of PNX/PNM in COVID-19 pneumonia patients treated with CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between PNX/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. We collected data from patients admitted to Luigi Sacco University Hospital of Milan from 21/02/2020 to 06/05/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring CPAP. Results: One-hundred-fifty-four patients were enrolled. During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients 2 needed invasive ventilation after PNX, two died. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP ([]10 cmH2O). All the PNX/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP group (5/37 vs 0/112, p<0,001). Conclusion: The incidence of PNX appears to be lower in COVID-19 than SARS and MERS, but their occurrence is accompanied by high mortality and worsening of clinical conditions.

METHODS: Based on the information officially announced on the official website of the Health Commission of Hebei Province, epidemiological data were collected from 133 children, aged 0-18 years, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang from January 2 to January 30, 2021. A statistical analysis was performed for general status, regional distribution, presence or absence of clusters, and results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. RESULTS: Among the 133 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 65 boys and 68 girls, with a male/female ratio of 0.96:1. The youngest age of onset was 3 months and 7 days, and the mean age of onset was (95) years. Of all the 133 children, 90(67.7%) were the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection among their family members. Of all the children, 108(81.2%) came from the Gaocheng District in Shijiazhuang, among whom 38(28.6%) were from Xiaoguozhuang Village where the first patient with a confirmed diagnosis lived. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test at week 2 after the outbreak showed positive results in 88 children (66.2%), and only 5 children had clinical symptoms before positive SARS-CoV-2 results were obtained. Of all the 133 children, 19(14.3%) were found positive in the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test after the outbreak, and 70(52.6%) had positive results for 4 times.

CONCLUSIONS: Among the children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang, there is a high proportion of children who are the first confirmed case in their family, and the children are mainly distributed in the rural areas of Gaocheng. Most of these children are students, so the prevention and control of cluster infection in schools should be taken seriously.

However, being on glucocorticoids makes it difficult to fully investigate this axis, especially in patients with severe COVID-19. We aimed to discover if there was a connection between blood total cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and mortality in patients with COVID-19. In Iran, 154 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied in a prospective cohort study. ACTH and cortisol levels in the blood were measured on the first or second day of hospitalization. Most patients (52.6 vs. 47.4%) were men over 50 years old (55.8%), and 44.4% had an underlying illness. Serum cortisol and plasma ACTH medians were 15.6 (g/dl) and 11.4 (pg/ml), respectively. 9.09% of the patients died. Cortisol levels were substantially lower in those who died (11.3 g/dl) than in patients who were discharged (16.7 g/dl, P < 0.01), while ACTH levels were unaffected. The most important factors determining mortality, according to the logistic model, were blood cortisol levels, the existence of an underlying disease, and the use of a mechanical ventilator. Cortisol levels that rose by one-unit correlated with a 26% lower risk of mortality. Comorbidities and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of death by 260 and 92 times, respectively. It can be concluded that in patients with COVID-19, a low cortisol level is linked to a high risk of mortality. Patients may sometimes have relative primary adrenal insufficiency.

How this cap is made is not completely understood. Here, we reconstitute the SARS-CoV-2 (7Me)GpppA(2-O-Me)-RNA cap using virally encoded non-structural proteins (nsps). We show that the kinase-like NiRAN domain(5) of nsp12 transfers RNA to the amino terminus of nsp9, forming a covalent RNA-protein intermediate (a process termed RNAylation). Subsequently, the NiRAN domain transfers RNA to GDP, forming the cap core structure GpppA-RNA. The nsp14(6) and nsp16(7) methyltransferases then add methyl groups to form functional cap structures. Structural analyses of the replication-transcription complex bound to nsp9 identified key interactions that mediate the capping reaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a reverse genetics system(8) that the N-terminus of nsp9 and the kinase-like active site residues in the NiRAN domain are required for successful SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Furthermore, RNAi represents a promising novel therapeutic option for treating human diseases, in particular cancer. Selective gene silencing by RNAi can be achieved essentially by two nucleic acid based methods: i) cytoplasmic delivery of short double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNA), where the gene silencing effect is only transient in nature, and possibly not suitable for all applications; or ii) nuclear delivery of gene expression cassettes that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which are processed like endogenous interfering RNA and lead to stable gene down-regulation. Both processes involve the use of nucleic acid based drugs, which are highly charged and do not cross cell membranes by free diffusion. Therefore, in vivo delivery of RNAi therapeutics must use technology that enables the RNAi therapeutic to traverse biological membrane barriers in vivo. Viruses and the vectors derived from them carry out precisely this task and have become a major delivery system for shRNA.

METHODS Qualitative research relying on semistructured key informant interviews with registered nurses and physical therapists (n = 19), hereafter \\"clinicians,\\" from four home health agencies. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, then analyzed using directed content analysis to identify relevant themes and concepts. RESULTS Three agencies were not-for-profit and one was for-profit; three were urban and one was rural; two operated on a local scale, one on a regional scale, and one on a national scale. Key informants had an average of 9.3 years of experience in home health care and an average age of 45.0 years. Clinicians described a cyclic process of family caregiver training including four major phases: initial assessment, education, reassessment, and adjustment. Initial assessment was informal and holistic; education was delivered via demonstration and teach-back; reassessment was used to evaluate caregiver progress and inform adjustments to the care plan. Clinicians noted that their perceptions regarding the success of family caregiver training efforts influenced decisions relating to clinical practice, including the number of visits provided and whether to discharge the patient. CONCLUSIONS Caregiver training is currently integrated into clinician workflows in home health care and helps determine visit intensity and discharge timing, but clinicians face a lack of structured assessment instruments or training materials.

The present pilot study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential and safety of MSCs isolated from healthy cord tissues in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with MSCs plus conventional therapy and 13 treated with conventional therapy alone (control) were included. The efficacy of MSC infusion was evaluated by changes in oxygenation index, clinical chemistry and hematology tests, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, and pulmonary computerized tomography (CT) imaging. The safety of MSC infusion was evaluated based on the occurrence of allergic reactions and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The MSC-treated group demonstrated significantly improved oxygenation index. The area of pulmonary inflammation decreased significantly, and the CT number in the inflammatory area tended to be restored. Decreased IgM levels were also observed after MSC therapy.

Here we aimed to examine the associations between IFG and diabetes at admission with risks of complications and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 312 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from 5 hospitals in Wuhan from Jan 1 to Mar 17, 2020. Clinical information, laboratory findings, complications, treatment regimens, and mortality status were collected. The associations between hyperglycemia and diabetes status at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range 38-66), and 172 (55%) were women. At the time of hospital admission, 84 (27%) had diabetes (and 36 were new-diagnosed), 62 (20%) had IFG, and 166 (53%) had normal fasting glucose (NFG) levels. Compared to patients with NFG, patients with IFG and diabetes developed more primary composite end-point events (9 [5%], 11 [18%], 26 [31%]), including receiving mechanical ventilation (5 [3%], 6 [10%], 21 [25%]), and death (4 [2%], 9 [15%], 20 [24%]).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present work is the presentation of the first real healthcare data for German teledematology within the framework of the external quality assurance of the model project Online DermatologistAppDoc. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anonymous data records submitted to Online DermatologistAppDoc between 21 November 2018 and 1 August 2019 were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively at the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Essen. In addition to the evaluation of the data records submitted so far, 100 cases submitted underwent a second assessment by a board-certified dermatologist to assess concordance. RESULTS: A total of 1364 cases (60.4% men, 39.6% women) were included in the current first external scientific evaluation. In 90.3% of the cases, remote diagnosis was possible. The two most frequent diagnoses were different forms of eczema (n = 270) and nevi (n = 163). Almost two thirds of the patients (64.3%) could be treated teledermatologically only. The random second examination of 100 cases resulted in an agreement of the diagnosis including the differential diagnosis/diagnoses in 97% of the cases.

In this study, we assessed the adequacy of self-collected pharyngeal and rectal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among individuals undergoing chlamydia and gonorrhea screening. METHODS: We used data from a large cohort study that included male and female adolescents between the ages of 12C24 years. We considered self-collected specimens adequate for clinical use if the human synthase gene (a control target of the assay) was detected in the specimen. RESULTS: In total, 2,458 specimens were included in the analysis.

The aim of this study is to advance epidemiological and mechanistic understanding of the neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using stroke as a case study. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies reporting stroke history, intensive inflammatory response, and procoagulant state C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), and coagulation indicator (D-dimer) in patients with COVID-19. Via network-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2 host genes and stroke-associated genes in the human protein-protein interactome, we inspected the underlying inflammatory mechanisms between COVID-19 and stroke. Finally, we further verified the network-based findings using three RNA-sequencing datasets generated from SARS-CoV-2 infected populations. We found that the overall pooled prevalence of stroke history was 2.98% (95% CI, 1.89C4.68; I(2)=69.2%) in the COVID-19 population. Notably, the severe group had a higher prevalence of stroke (6.06%; 95% CI 3.80C9.52; I(2) = 42.6%) compare to the non-severe group (1.1%, 95% CI 0.72C1.71; I(2) = 0.0%).

Phage therapy is becoming an alternative strategy to control multidrug-resistant Salmonella infections in young chicks. However, how bacteriophages affect the growth performance of chicks infected with S. Pullorum remains poorly understood. Herein, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of Salmonella phage CKT1 against hypervirulent arthritis-causing S. Pullorum. The results showed that single phage treatment after hypervirulent S. Pullorum infection significantly improved body weight loss of chicks. Compared with enlarged liver and spleen in only Salmonella challenged group, phage administration substantially reduced the liver/body and spleen/body weight ratios, bacterial loads in organs and the degree of hepatic sinusoidal dilatation and congestion. Moreover, phage CKT1 can enter the organs of chicks and stay for at least 3 d in liver and spleen, and promote higher serum levels of IL-6 production within 6 d postinfection, indicating phage-induced bacterial lysis may be involved in inflammatory immune response to S. Pullorum infection. Analysis of the microbiome of gastrointestinal tract of chicks demonstrated that Salmonella challenge significantly reduced the relative abundances of Lachnoclostridium and Blautia, resulting in remarkably increased Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella becoming the predominant bacterial taxa. In contrast, the use of phage CKT1 significantly reduced Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella populations in intestine, permitting the proliferation of beneficial microbiota in Firmicutes including Lachnoclostridium, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Pseudoflavonifractor. In addition, phage alone treatments did not affect the normal gut microbiota structure of chicks, and phage therapy on Salmonella infected chicks increased bacteria species richness in the cecum. These results suggest that Salmonella phage CKT1 could improve growth performance of chicks challenged with S. Pullorum by normalizing the abnormal intestinal microbiome.","output":"Salmonella phage CKT1 significantly relieves the body weight loss of chicks by normalizing the abnormal intestinal microbiome caused by hypervirulent Salmonella Pullorum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is linked to diverse human diseases including viral infections.

Our study introduces a novel approach to identification of contributors to EMS environment contamination and development of infection control strategies, using a bacteriophage surrogate for pathogenic organisms. METHODS: Bacteriophage X174 was used to trace cross-contamination and evaluate current disinfection practices and a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) wipe intervention within emergency response vehicles. Prior to EMS calls, 2 surfaces were seeded with X174. On call completion, EMS vehicle and equipment surfaces were sampled before decontamination, after decontamination per current practices, and after implementation of the intervention. RESULTS: Current decontamination practices did not significantly reduce viral loads on surfaces (P = .3113), but H(2)O(2) wipe intervention did (P = .0065). Bacteriophage spread to 56% (27/48) of sites and was reduced to 54% (26/48) and 40% (19/48) with current decontamination practices and intervention practices, respectively. CONCLUSION: Results suggest firefighters' hands were the main vehicles of microbial transfer. Current practices were not consistently applied or standardized and minimally reduced prevalence and quantity of microbial contamination on EMS surfaces. Although use of a consistent protocol of H(2)O(2) wipes significantly reduced percent prevalence and concentration of viruses, training and promotion of surface disinfection should be provided.","output":"Spread of infectious microbes during emergency medical response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For several years video consultations have been regarded as a new form of medical healthcare infrastructure, in addition to personal doctor-patient contacts and have also been partly promoted The COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected topicality and attention to the use of video consultations The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenarztliche Bundesvereinigung) decided on special regulations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduce previous obstacles to the use of telemedicine and video consultations (and also partly of conventional telephony) The present statement of the German Society of Rheumatology (DGRh) on the use of video consultations is intended to give an overview of in which form and with which limitations video consultations can be used in rheumatology in Germany It sketches an outlook on how video consultations can undertake which functions in rheumatological care in the future","output":"[Statement of the German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) on the use of video consultations in rheumatology]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) METHODS We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia) Transcriptional aspects of three core elements C pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses C were interrogated Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity RESULTS The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0 75-0 89) and indicating disease severity CONCLUSIONS Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling The immune-associated host transcriptional signatures of COVID-19 hold promise as a tool for improving COVID-19 diagnosis and indicating disease severity","output":"Metatranscriptomic Characterization of COVID-19 Identified A Host Transcriptional Classifier Associated With Immune Signaling ;Clinical Infectious Diseases ;Oxford Academic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) antibody cocktail reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load in descriptive analyses of the first 275 Covid-19 outpatients in the phase 1/2 portion of an ongoing double-blind, seamless phase 1/2/3 trial. Methods: This final analysis of the phase 1/2 portion includes 799 patients: 275 (group-1) and 524 (group-2). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo, 2400mg REGEN-COV, or 8000mg REGEN-COV, and characterized at baseline for endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2 (serum antibody-positive/negative).

AIM: This study investigated operating room nurses' anxiety levels and related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research was conducted between July and September 2020. The sample consisted of 192 operating room nurses. Data were collected using a descriptive questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). RESULTS: Participants had moderate levels of anxiety. The risk factors associated with high levels of anxiety included having chronic diseases, working with patients causing worry, fear of contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to loved ones, incompetence of hospitals in managing the pandemic, lack of support from hospital managers, taking few breaks and working long shifts due to preventive measures at the workplace. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results show that operating room nurses have had moderate anxiety levels since the onset of the pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to regularly identify and meet their mental and emotional needs to implement early preventive interventions. Identifying risk factors will help recognize anxiety in operating room nurses and take measures to protect their mental health while working with high-risk patients in different clinics during the pandemic.

Pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased monolayer permeability, is a major component of ARDS. Vascular leak results in parenchymal accumulation of leukocytes, protein, and extravascular water, leading to pulmonary edema, ischemia, and activation of coagulation associated with COVID-19. Endothelial inflammation further contributes to uncontrolled cytokine storm in ARDS. We have recently demonstrated that Krppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a transcription factor which promotes endothelial quiescence and monolayer integrity, is significantly reduced in experimental models of ARDS. Lung inflammation and high-tidal volume ventilation result in reduced KLF2, leading to pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and acute lung injury. Mechanistically, we found that KLF2 is a potent transcriptional activator of Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (RAPGEF3) which orchestrates and maintains vascular integrity. Moreover, KLF2 regulates multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS)-implicated ARDS genes. Whether lung KLF2 is regulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Here we report that endothelial KLF2 is significantly reduced in human lung autopsies from COVID-19 patients, which supports that ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 is a vascular phenotype possibly attributed to KLF2 down-regulation. We provide additional data demonstrating that KLF2 is down-regulated in SARS-CoV infection in mice.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces Krppel-Like Factor 2 in human lung autopsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug repositioning is the scientific strategy of investigating existing drugs for additional clinical indications.

The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries.
