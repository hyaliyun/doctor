Therefore, the long-distance on-site internal corrosion detection and high-throughput sequencing techniques were employed in this study to investigate the distribution shifts of the corrosive microbial communities on the inner wall of a refined oil pipeline and its impact on the internal corrosion. The microorganisms colonizing on the inner wall of the pipeline showed significant distribution differences between the axial direction of the relative elevation and radial direction of the cross-section. On the inner wall, the high diversity and the abundance of the corrosive microbial communities induced serious microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), while the chemical corrosion and the synergy of the corrosive microbial communities accelerated the internal corrosion of the refined oil pipeline. A corrosion zone model has been proposed, which divides the pipeline cross-section into the sediment, the water-oil interface, the gas-oil interface, and the oil fully immersed zones. Therefore, the relationships between the environment, corrosion degree, and distribution characteristics of the corrosive microbial communities in the pipeline were analyzed. This research exhibited the importance of the distribution characteristics of the corrosive microorganisms on the inner wall of the refined oil pipelines.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to map the teaching situation in QB13 palliative medicine in SS 2020 under the influence of COVID-19 and from this to derive the need for networking and support for the coming semesters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The key persons involved in palliative care education in all 41 medical faculties in Germany were identified and invited by the coordination office of the German Society for Palliative Medicine (DGP) to participate in an online survey using SurveyMonkey?. The questionnaire consisted of 15 items dealing with the evaluation of the past semester and the need for support for the coming semester. RESULTS: Out of 41 contacted teachers 16 participated in the survey. Most of them described the challenge of teaching in SS 2020 as successful. Support from the faculties was provided primarily in the form of digital teaching structures. A digital teaching design is also planned for the coming semester. Power point slides with sound and the conference tool Zoom? are often used. CONCLUSION: The design of examinations in SS 2020 is rated worse in the self-evaluation than the teaching design.

After flap elevation, defects were assigned to one characteristic class and treated by means of DBBMC. Following healing, patients were enrolled in an individualized supportive periodontal/peri-implant (SPT) program. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients reached the 5 years examination, as 11 patients were lost to follow-up and 13 implants were removed. Overall treatment success was registered in 29 patients (45.3%).

Intuitively, it would seem that allocations designed to minimize infections should prioritize those with the highest risk of being infected and infecting others. This prescription is well supported by vaccination theory, e.g., when the vaccination campaign aims to reach herd immunity. In this work, we show, however, that for vaccines providing partial protection (leaky vaccines) and for sufficiently high values of the basic reproduction number, intuition is overturned: the optimal allocation for minimizing the number of infections prioritizes the vaccination of those who are least likely to be infected. Furthermore, we show that this phenomenon occurs at a range of basic reproduction numbers relevant for the currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-19.

L-Citrulline (L-Cit) is a nutraceutical amino acid that is gaining research interest for its role in body temperature regulation and nitric oxide synthesis. This study investigated whether dietary supplementation with L-Cit (1% of basal diet) could ameliorate the effects of acute HS on thermotolerance, redox balance, and inflammatory responses of broilers. Ross 308 broilers (288 chicks) were subjected to two environments; thermoneutral at 24C (TNZ) or HS at 35C for 5 h, and fed two diets; control or L-Cit. The results showed that HS increased the ear, rectal (RT), and core body (CBT) temperatures of broilers, along with higher respiratory rate. The RT and CBT readings were intermittently affected with time effect, whereas, L-Cit supplementation lowered the mean CBT than the control diet. Antioxidant assays showed that superoxide dismutase was increased during HS, while, catalase was promoted by L-Cit supplementation. In addition, L-Cit induced glutathione peroxidase activity compared to the control diet during HS. Hypothalamic heat shock protein (HSP)-90 was upregulated by HS, but L-Cit downregulated heat shock factor (HSF)-1, and HSP 60 mRNA expressions. HSF 3 mRNA expression was downregulated by L-Cit under TNZ condition. More so, HS increased the plasma nitric oxide (NO) concentration but lowered the total NO synthase (tNOS) activity. In contrast, L-Cit supplementation limited NO production but increased the tNOS activity. Arginase activity was increased in the control fed group during HS but L-Cit supplementation lowered this effect. The NOS-COX pathway was significantly affected under TNZ condition, since L-Cit supplementation downregulated the mRNA expression of iNOS-COX2 in the hypothalamus, and further reduced the serum PGE2 concentration. Together, these data indicates that L-Cit influenced the antioxidant defense, heat shock response and nitric oxide regeneration both under thermoneutral and HS conditions; and that L-Cit may be directly and/or indirectly involved in the central regulation of body temperature.","output":"L-Citrulline Influences the Body Temperature, Heat Shock Response and Nitric Oxide Regeneration of Broilers Under Thermoneutral and Heat Stress Condition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most prominent hematologic effects of infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increased thrombotic risk.

This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. DATA AND METHODS: Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. RESULTS: Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions.

Common clinical and nonclinical diagnostic testing methods have been partially effective in satisfying the increasing demand for fast detection point-of-care (POC) methods to slow down further spread. However, accurate point-of-risk diagnosis of this emerging viral infection is paramount as the need for simultaneous standard operating procedures and symptom management of SARS-CoV-2 will be the norm for years to come. A sensitive, cost-effective biosensor with mass production capability is crucial until a universal vaccination becomes available. Optical biosensors can provide a noninvasive, extremely sensitive rapid detection platform with sensitivity down to 67 fg/ml (1 fM) concentration in a few minutes. These biosensors can be manufactured on a mass scale (millions) to detect the COVID-19 viral load in nasal, saliva, urine, and serological samples, even if the infected person is asymptotic. Methods investigated here are the most advanced available platforms for biosensing optical devices that have resulted from the integration of state-of-the-art designs and materials. These approaches include, but are not limited to, integrated optical devices, plasmonic resonance, and emerging nanomaterial biosensors. The lab-on-chip platforms examined here are suitable not only for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection but also for other contagious virions such as influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).","output":"Fast, accurate, point-of-care COVID-19 pandemic diagnosis enabled through advanced lab-on-chip optical biosensors: Opportunities and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this survey of infectious diseases consultants, 90% reported that their health care facilities have plans in place to address severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Methods A single-center, retrospective review between March 2020 and March 2021 identified 6 patients with a history of COVID-19 who subsequently underwent LVAD implantation. Baseline characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes were examined. Results Patients were male (83%), Black (67%), and implanted with a Heartmate 3 for destination therapy. The time from COVID-19 diagnosis to LVAD surgery ranged from 3 days to 6 months (median 40 days, [IQR 12-114 days]). All patients were supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and high-dose inotropes prior to implant. The median age was 60 years (IQR 57-61 years) and body mass index 30 kg/m2 (IQR 24-31 kg/m2). Following implantation, 5 patients (83%) had respiratory failure greater than 7 days on ventilator support, 2 (33%) required tracheostomy, and 2 (33%) were reintubated before successful extubation. Two patients (33%) required temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support, 4 patients (67%) needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and 3 patients (50%) suffered ischemic strokes: two patients on postoperative day 1, and the other on postoperative day 5. The median length of hospital stay following surgery ranged from 16 to 73 days (median 53 days, [IQR 35-67 days]). Five patients (83%) were discharged from the hospital, 2 to acute inpatient rehab, 1 to a subacute rehabilitation facility, and 2 to home. Two patients (33%) were readmitted within 30 days for gastrointestinal bleeding and neuropathic pain.

Myocardial cytopathy associated with hypoxic response has been largely overlooked in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, histology analysis and cardiac function of COVID-19 cases are often reported separately, rendering an incomplete understanding of COVID-19 cardiac symptoms. ObjectiveTo examine the relationship between myocardial cellular responses to hypoxic stress versus cardiac functional alterations within the same COVID-19 patients. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsCellular hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF1) expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using post-mortem COVID-19 heart and lung tissues with known cardiac echocardiography records from a total of 8 patients. Clinical echocardiography data were obtained from Mount Sinai Heart between March to December, 2020. All gender and age groups were considered as long as cardiac involvement meets the preserved (EF > 50%) or moderate to severe (EF < 45%) criteria with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cell-type specific subcellular localization of HIF1 expression and nuclear stability was examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to quantify apoptosis. Main Outcomes and MeasuresNo planned outcomes of this study as this is a retrospective analysis based on post-mortem specimens exclusively. ResultsCardiac HIF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with preserved EF levels than it was in the low EF group. In the preserved EF group, HIF1 is protective against apoptosis predominantly in endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. In the low EF group, HIF1 protects cardiomyocyte nuclear integrity as evident by its nuclear accumulation with nuclear envelope preservation. Conclusions and RelevanceThis study establishes a direct link of cardiac cellular responses to hypoxic stress with matching functional and histological data, serving as one of the first studies to bridge previous stand-alone clinical data and cellular data. The protective role of HIF1 in hearts may help predict cardiac involvement in not only COVID-19 patients, but also decipher the underlying mechanisms in other forms of viral cardiomyopathy.

A range of technologies and strategies for pathogen genome enrichment and sequencing are being used by laboratories worldwide, together with different, and sometimes ad hoc, analytical procedures for generating genome sequences. A fully integrated analytical process for raw sequence to consensus genome determination, suited to outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is critical to provide a solid genomic basis for epidemiological analyses and well-informed decision making. We have developed a web-based platform and integrated bioinformatic workflows that help to provide consistent high-quality analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated with either the Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Using an intuitive web-based interface, this workflow automates data quality control, SARS-CoV-2 reference-based genome variant and consensus calling, lineage determination, and provides the ability to submit the consensus sequence and necessary metadata to GenBank, GISAID, and INSDC raw data repositories. We tested workflow usability using real world data and validated the accuracy of variant and lineage analysis using several test datasets, and further performed detailed comparisons with results from the COVID-19 Galaxy Project workflow. Our analyses indicate that EC-19 workflows generate high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed test results from 15,011 adults who underwent 1 SARS-CoV-2 NAATs; 2,699 had an initial negative NAAT and repeat testing. We defined FNs as 1 negative NAATs followed by a positive NAAT within 14 days during the same episode of illness. We stratified subjects with FNs by duration of symptoms prior to the initial FN test (5 days versus >5 days) and examined their clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics. RESULTS: Sixty of 2,699 subjects (2.2%) had a FN result during the study period. The weekly frequency of FNs among subjects with repeat testing peaked at 4.4%, coinciding with peak NAAT positivity (38%). Most subjects with FNs had symptoms (52/60; 87%) and chest radiography (19/32; 59%) consistent with COVID-19. Of the FN NAATs, 18/60 (30%) were performed early (i.e., 1 day of symptom onset), and 18/60 (30%) were performed late (i.e., >7 days after symptom onset) in disease.

Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.","output":"Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID-19 pandemic in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Infectious conjunctivitis is among the most common pediatric infections worldwide; antibiotics are often not indicated. We aimed to determine factors associated with ophthalmic antibiotic prescribing and changes in prescribing prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a single center. METHODS Encounters for children with infectious conjunctivitis from 2017 to 2020 at Denver Health and Hospital Authority clinics were analyzed retrospectively. Factors associated with prescribing were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression modeling. Encounter numbers and prescribing patterns for telephone versus in-person visits before and during the pandemic were compared and stratified. RESULTS Of 5,283 patients encounters for conjunctivitis, 3,841 (72.7%) resulted in an ophthalmic antibiotic prescription. Concurrent diagnosis with acute otitis media (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.20 (95% CI, 0.16-0.25) and later study year (2018-aOR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.65-0.89]; 2019- aOR = 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.67]) were associated with reduced odds of prescribing. Compared with those evaluated in pediatric clinics, patients evaluated in family medicine (aOR = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.58-0.83]) or optometry/ophthalmology clinics (aOR = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.02-0.14]) were less likely to have antibiotics prescribed, whereas, patients evaluated via telephone had a 5.43 (95% CI, 3.97-7.42) greater odds of being prescribed ophthalmic antibiotics. Antibiotic prescribing increased from 67.8% prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to 81.9% during the pandemic (P < 0.0001).

Field sampling methods often collect pooled samples of bat excreta from plastic sheets placed under\\\\roosts. However, positive bias is introduced because multiple individuals may contribute to pooled samples, making studies of viral dynamics difficult. Here, we explore the general issue of bias in spatial sample pooling using Hendra virus in Australian bats as a case study. We assessed the accuracy of different under\\\\roost sampling designs using generalized additive models and field data from individually captured bats and pooled urine samples. We then used theoretical simulation models of bat density and under\\\\roost sampling to understand the mechanistic drivers of bias. The most commonly used sampling design estimated viral prevalence 3.2 times higher than individual\\\\level data, with positive bias 5C7 times higher than other designs due to spatial autocorrelation among sampling sheets and clustering of bats in roosts. Simulation results indicate using a stratified random design to collect 30C40 pooled urine samples from 80 to 100 sheets, each with an area of 0.75C1 m(2), and would allow estimation of true prevalence with minimum sampling bias and false negatives. These results show that widely used under\\\\roost sampling techniques are highly sensitive to viral presence, but lack specificity, providing limited information regarding viral dynamics. Improved estimation of true prevalence can be attained with minor changes to existing designs such as reducing sheet size, increasing sheet number, and spreading sheets out within the roost area. Our findings provide insight into how spatial sample pooling is vulnerable to bias for a wide range of systems in disease ecology, where optimal sampling design is influenced by pathogen prevalence, host population density, and patterns of aggregation.","output":"Optimizing noninvasive sampling of a zoonotic bat virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) serve as daily essential services for people with opioid use disorder. This study seeks to identify modifications to operations and adoption of safety measures at Pennsylvania OTPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 25-min online survey to clinical and administrative directors at all 103 state-licensed OTPs in Pennsylvania was fielded from September to November 2020. Survey domains included: 1) changes to services, client volume, hours and staffing during the COVID-19 pandemic 2) types of services modifications 3) safety protocols to reduce COVID-19 transmission 4) challenges to operations during the pandemic. RESULTS: Forty-seven directors responded, for a response rate of 45%. Almost all respondents reported making some service modification (96%, n = 43). Almost half (47%, n = 21) of respondents reported reductions in the number of clients served. OTPs were more likely to adopt safety protocols that did not require significant funding, such as limiting the number of people entering the site (100%, n = 44), posting COVID-safety information (100%, n = 44), enforcing social distancing (98%, n = 43), and increasing sanitation (100%, n = 44). Only 34% (n = 14) of OTPS provided N95 masks to most or all staff. Respondents reported that staffs stress and negative mental health (86%, n = 38) and staff caregiving responsibilities (84%, n = 37) during the pandemic were challenges to maintaining OTP operations. CONCLUSION: OTPs faced numerous challenges to operations and adoption of safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study analysed the clinical prognosis of discharged COVID-19 patients by monitoring their SAR-CoV-2 nucleic acid status, which provided a theoretical basis for medical institutions to formulate discharge standards and follow-up management for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 13 discharged COVID-19 patients who were quarantined for 4 weeks at home. The patient's daily clinical signs were recorded and sputum and faecal specimens were regularly sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS: The time between initial symptoms and meeting discharge criteria was 18 to 44 days with an average of 25  6 days. The faecal samples of two patients still tested positive after meeting the discharge criteria and the sputum samples of four patients returned positive 5 to 14 days after discharge. The rate of the recurring positive test result in samples from the respiratory system was 31% (4/13). CONCLUSION: Under the present discharge criteria, the high presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in faecal and respiratory samples of discharged COVID-19 patients indicates potential infectivity. Therefore, we suggest that faecal virus nucleic acid should be tested as a routine monitoring index for COVID-19 and a negative result be added to the criteria.

Loss of ACE2 function is implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pathogenesis, but little is known about ACE2 biogenesis and activity in the airways. We report that ACE2 is shed from human airway epithelia, a site of SARS-CoV infection. The regulation of ACE2 release was investigated in polarized human airway epithelia. Constitutive generation of soluble ACE2 was inhibited by DPC 333, implicating a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17). Phorbol ester, ionomycin, endotoxin, and IL-1beta and TNFalpha acutely induced ACE2 release, further supporting that ADAM17 and ADAM10 regulate ACE2 cleavage. Soluble ACE2 was enzymatically active and partially inhibited virus entry into target cells. We determined that the ACE2 cleavage site resides between amino acid 716 and the putative transmembrane domain starting at amino acid 741. To reveal structural determinants underlying ACE2 release, several mutant and chimeric ACE2 proteins were engineered. Neither the juxtamembrane stalk region, transmembrane domain, nor the cytosolic domain was needed for constitutive ACE2 release. Interestingly, a point mutation in the ACE2 ectodomain, L584A, markedly attenuated shedding. The resultant ACE2-L584A mutant trafficked to the cell membrane and facilitated SARS-CoV entry into target cells, suggesting that the ACE2 ectodomain regulates its release and that residue L584 might be part of a putative sheddase \\"recognition motif.\\" Thus ACE2 must be cell associated to serve as a CoV receptor and soluble ACE2 might play a role in modifying inflammatory processes at the airway mucosal surface.","output":"Ectodomain shedding of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in human airway epithelia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary aims to provide a glimpse into some of the early and continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our global and public health projects with different particularities: research in low-income and socially disadvantaged settings;research with vulnerable populations, such as refugees, asylum seekers, Indigenous communities, children, and mental health service users;and research with healthcare professionals and health planners In the early context of restrictions caused by COVID-19, this commentary highlights our research setbacks and challenges, and the ways in which we are adapting research methodologies, while considering ethical implications related to the pandemic and their impacts on conducting global and public health research As we learn to become increasingly aware of some of our limitations in the face of the pandemic, some positives are also worth highlighting: we are mobilizing our training and research skills to participate in COVID-19 projects and to disseminate knowledge on COVID-19, including through papers such as this one However, we do acknowledge that these opportunities have not been equitable Each thematic section of this commentary concludes with key recommendations related to research in the early and continuing context of COVID-19 that we believe to be applicable to early- and not-so-early- career researchers working in the global and public health fields","output":"Re-thinking global and public health projects during the COVID-19 pandemic context: considerations and recommendations for early- and not-so-early- career researchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in 2019 and quickly spread globally, causing a pandemic.

While COVID-19 vaccinations are proven to help slow the spread of infection and prevent serious illness, they are not equitably available worldwide. Almost 40% of the worlds population remains unvaccinated. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated volatile organic compounds found in the breath, urine, and sweat of infected individuals can be detected by canine olfaction. Medical detection dogs may be a feasible, accurate and affordable SARS-CoV-2 screening method. METHODS: In this double-blinded, case-control, validation study, we obtained sweat samples from inpatients and outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a polymerase chain reaction test. Medical detection dogs were trained to distinguish SARS CoV-2 positive samples from SARS-CoV-2 negative samples, using reward-based reinforcement. RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 584 individuals (6 to 97 years of age; 24% positive SARS CoV-2 samples and 76% negative SARS CoV-2 samples). In the Testing Phase, all dogs performed with high accuracy in detecting SARS-CoV-2: overall diagnostic sensitivity was 98% and specificity was 92%. In a follow-up phase, one dog screened 153 patients for SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting with 96% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity.

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate chest CT performances to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with regard to RT-PCR as reference standard in a low incidence area. METHODS: A survey was sent to radiology department in 4 hospitals in an administrative French region of weak disease prevalence (3.4%). Study design was approved by the local institutional review board and recorded on the clinicaltrial.gov website (NCT04339686). Written informed consent was waived due to retrospective anonymized data collection. Patients who underwent a RT-PCR and a chest CT scan within 48 h for COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion were consecutively included. Diagnostic accuracy including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of chest CT regarding RT-PCR as reference standard were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients had abnormal chest CT findings compatible with a COVID-19 pneumonia (26%, 129/487). Among the 358 negative chest CT findings, 3% (10/358) were RT-PCR positive. Chest CT sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value were respectively 87% (IC95: 85, 89; 69/79), 85% (IC95: 83, 87; 348/408), 53% (IC95: 50, 56; 69/129), and 97% (IC95: 95, 99; 348/358).

In this study, we present a multitarget real-time TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its circulating variants harboring mutations that give SARS-CoV-2 a selective advantage. Seven different primer-probe sets that included probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides were designed to amplify specific wild-type and mutant sequences in Orf1ab, Envelope (E), Spike (S), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes. Furthermore, a newly developed primer-probe set targeted human beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) as a highly sensitive internal control for RT efficacy. All singleplex and fourplex assays detected less than or equal to 14 copies/reaction of quantified synthetic RNA transcripts, with a linear amplification range of 9 logarithmic orders. Primer-probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited no false-positive amplifications with other common respiratory pathogens, including human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU-1. Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their rapid spread in some populations, fourplex rRT-PCR assay containing four primer-probe sets represents a reliable approach to detect multiple viral target sequences containing typical mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a single reaction, allowing quicker detection of circulating relevant variants.","output":"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a fourplex real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Broad nationwide restrictions of social life and contacts were implemented in Germany on March 22nd, 2020, to reduce the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS?CoV?2). It is unclear how these restrictions affected peoples health behaviour. Objective To: i) examine changes in self-reported health behaviour of the German population regarding tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity during the restrictions compared with the time prior to these restrictions;ii) explore associations between potential changes and socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods We used data from two waves (June-August 2020) of the German Study on Tobacco Use (DEBRA): a cross-sectional, representative, face-to\\\\face household survey in people aged  14 years (N = 4078). Associations between socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics and changes in each health behaviour were analysed using multinomial logistic regression analyses (categories of the dependent variable: increase, no change, decrease). Results People reported changes in their health behaviour: smoking increase = 24.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.5C26.7), decrease = 12.2% (95%CI = 10.4C14.4);alcohol consumption increase = 12.9% (95%CI = 11.7C14.1), decrease = 19.9% (95%CI = 18.4C21.3);physical activity increase = 18.5% (95%CI = 17.3C19.7);decrease = 29.4% (95%CI = 28.0C31.0). People with a lower level of education and younger age were more likely to report a harmful change in health behaviour. Conclusion The majority of people in Germany did not change their health behaviour during the 2020 corona restrictions. Among those who changed, relatively more increased their smoking and decreased their alcohol consumption and physical activity. Public health interventions in this context should particularly target people with lower socioeconomic status and younger age e.g., by offering more online courses.","output":"Did self\\\\reported tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity change during the COVID-19 restrictions in Germany in spring 2020?

The Value Institutes Geospatial Analytics Core applied spatial methodologies to inform ChristianaCares pandemic response around telehealth, testing disparities, and test site prioritization. METHODS: Descriptive data related to disparities in telehealth utilization were mapped to identify areas in which intervention is needed to increase telehealth access. Cluster detection methodology was used to identify hot and cold spots for COVID-19 testing by place and race across New Castle County, DE. A composite risk score was created to prioritize communities for testing sites. All analyses took place in Delaware from March-June 2020, with particular emphasis on New Castle County. RESULTS: Parts of northeastern New Castle County and western Sussex County were highlighted for intervention to increase broadband internet access for telehealth utilization. Cold spots for COVID-19 testing were found in New Castle County, indicating neighborhoods in which testing levels were significantly lower than expected. Data for testing levels, disease positivity, and socioeconomic risk factors were used to identify communities in northeastern New Castle County that warranted new test sites to mitigate disease spread.

Identifying the anatomic pain generators is essential to direct appropriate treatment. The purpose of this review is to outline different sources of post-mastectomy pain and to provide recommendations for the treatment of each one. ABSTRACT: Persistent pain following treatment for breast cancer is common and often imprecisely labeled as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS). PMPS is a disorder with multiple potential underlying causes including intercostobrachial nerve injury, intercostal neuromas, phantom breast pain, and pectoralis minor syndrome. Adding further complexity to the issue are various musculoskeletal pain syndromes including cervical radiculopathy, shoulder impingement syndrome, frozen shoulder, and myofascial pain that may occur concurrently and at times overlap with PMPS. These overlapping pain syndromes may be difficult to separate from one another, but precise diagnosis is essential, as treatment for each pain generator may be distinct. The purpose of this review is to clearly outline different pain sources based on anatomic location that commonly occur following treatment for breast cancer, and to provide tailored and evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of each disorder.","output":"A Targeted Approach to Post-Mastectomy Pain and Persistent Pain following Breast Cancer Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine and antiviral development against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease currently lacks a validated small animal model.

Expanding COVID-19 testing to include environmental surfaces would ideally be performed with inexpensive swabs that could be transported safely without concern of being a source of new infections. However, CDC-approved clinical-grade sampling supplies and techniques using a synthetic swab are expensive, potentially expose laboratory workers to viable virus and prohibit analysis of the microbiome due to the presence of antibiotics in viral transport media (VTM). To this end, we performed a series of experiments comparing the diagnostic yield using five consumer-grade swabs (including plastic and wood shafts and various head materials including cotton, synthetic, and foam) and one clinical grade swab for inhibition to RNA. For three of these swabs, we evaluated performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 in twenty intensive care unit (ICU) hospital rooms of patients with 16 COVID-19+. All swabs were placed in 95% ethanol and further evaluated in terms of RNase activity. SARS-CoV-2 was measured both directly from the swab and from the swab eluent. Results: Compared to samples collected in VTM, 95% ethanol demonstrated significant inhibition properties against RNases. When extracting directly from the swab head as opposed to the eluent, RNA recovery was approximately 2-4x higher from all six swab types tested as compared to the clinical standard of testing the eluent from a CDC-approved synthetic swab. The limit of detection (LoD) of SARs-CoV-2 from floor samples collected using the CGp or TMI swabs was similar or better than the CDC standard, further suggesting that swab type does not impact RNA recovery as measured by SARs-CoV-2. The LoD for TMI was between 0-362.5 viral particles while SYN and CGp were both between 725a1450 particles. Lastly microbiome analyses (16S rRNA) of paired samples (e.g., environment to host) collected using different swab types in triplicate indicated that microbial communities were not impacted by swab type but instead driven by the patient and sample type (floor or nasal). Conclusions: Compared to using a clinical-grade synthetic swab, detection of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples collected from ICU rooms of patients with COVID was similar using consumer grade swabs, stored in 95% ethanol. The yield was best from the swab head rather than the eluent and the low level of RNase activity in these samples makes it possible to perform concomitant microbiome analysis.","output":"Feasibility of using alternative swabs and storage solutions for paired SARS-CoV-2 detection and microbiome analysis in the hospital environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused a global public health crisis affecting most countries, including Ethiopia, in various ways.

METHODS: We enrolled 2,445 junior high school students (Han: 1,153; ethnic minorities: 1,292) aged 12C16 years from two schools in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Gansu Province from November 2020 to February 2021. We measured the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) using a scoliometer. Two-factor analysis of variance was used to comparatively analyze differences in the ATR according to ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and SES between the groups. Associations between risk factors and scoliosis were estimated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with an unconditional multivariate logistic regression model for the two groups. RESULTS: Adolescents with Han ethnicity were more likely to have scoliosis than their ethnic minority counterparts (10.8% vs. 7.1%, P < 0.05). The ATR value in the Han group decreased with age whereas the minority group showed an upward trend (P < 0.05). The difference between ethnic groups was not significant, only at level 3. In particular, the ATR values among Han girls were significantly higher than those of ethnic minority girls (P < 0.05). Compared with Han adolescents, the BMI of ethnic minorities had a greater impact on the ATR. A statistically significant difference in SES was found between the two ethnic groups (P < 0.05). Hukou and parents' occupation had an important influence on the onset of scoliosis. CONCLUSIONS: Han adolescents had higher ATR values and were more likely to have scoliosis than ethnic minority adolescents in our study.

This study aims to evaluate the effect on wrist fracture care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in British Orthopaedic Association Standards of Trauma and Orthopaedics wrist fracture management guidelines, and introduction of lockdown restrictions. Methods This is a retrospective observational study with data collected using the Pathpoint eTrauma platform (Open Medical, United Kingdom). All adults (18 years+) admitted with wrist fractures within the study phases to Manchester University National Health Service Foundation Trust were included. Each phase of the study period represents a change in lockdown restrictions, including lockdown 1, period of eased restrictions after lockdown 1, lockdown 2, and lockdown 3. These phases were then compared with a prepandemic period. A total of 608 referrals were included for analysis. Results The number of referrals per week decreased from 9.94 prepandemic to as low as 8.12 during lockdown 2. Falls remained the most common mechanism of injury, followed by cycling that saw an increase by more than threefold from 2.42% prepandemic to 8.17% (p=0.500) during lockdown 1 and 8.77% (p=0.0164) during the easing of lockdown 1. Sports-related injuries and occupational injuries decreased throughout. Assaults and altercations, road traffic accidents, roller-skate, and skateboard-related injuries increased throughout. Surgical procedures per week decreased from 5.06 prepandemic to as low as 4.55 during lockdown 1. Procedure cancellations remained steady apart from an increase during lockdown 2. Referrals managed operatively increased from 50.9% prepandemic to 58.9% in lockdown 2, before dropping to 49.2% in lockdown 3. Mean time from presentation to surgery increased from 9.08 days prepandemic to 16.27 days in lockdown 1 but decreased to just below the prepandemic baseline thereafter. Conclusion Overall, there was a decrease in the number of wrist fracture referrals and surgical procedures compared with before the pandemic. There was also an increased wait-time to surgery and an increased rate of cancellations. Statistical analyses fail to find significance in changes other than mechanisms of injury, which resulted from lockdown restrictions.

Patients Thirty premenopausal women undergoing surgery for tubal ligation and 16 premenopausal women undergoing IVF. Intervention (s) Administration of hCG and harvesting of preovulatory/ovulatory follicles by timed laparoscopy and collection of granulosa/lutein cells and cumulus cells at the time of oocyte retrieval. Main Outcome Measures Expression and localization of ACE2 in granulosa cells and dominant follicles collected across the periovulatory period of the menstrual cycle and in hGLC using qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results ACE2 expression (mRNA and protein) is up-regulated in human ovulatory follicles after hCG administration. ACE2 expression was higher in cumulus cells than granulosa cells. hCG increased the expression of ACE2 in primary hGLC cultures, but the increase was inhibited by both RU486 (an antagonist for progesterone receptor and glucocorticoid receptor) and CORT125281 (a selective glucocorticoid receptor), but not by AG1478 (an EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or by dexamethasone.

METHODS The cross-sectional study examined the eyes of 44 subjects, graded from the first to third keratoconus stages by Amsler-Krumeich classification. We obtained measurements in two ways: (a) by projecting two perpendicular axes onto a cornea (first, through the central point of the cornea and keratoconus apex; second, as the perpendicular axis) to read the elevation values at points on these axes as parameters characterising the corneal surface; (b) by projecting circles with different diameters around the central part of the cornea (1, 2, and 3 mm) and reading elevation values at points equally displaced on these circles as parameters characterising an anterior surface slope. Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).","output":"The impact of irregular corneal shape parameters on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high rate of patients with tuberculosis (TB) with the graph showing a continual increase requires the research in any sector as the programs to eradicate tuberculosis One of the applications is the Decision Support System (DSS) that helps the medical experts particularly doctors in diagnosing TB grade 1+ 2+, and 3+ rapidly Another problem is related to the imbalance between the number of patients and the number of medical practitioners in the condition of pandemic Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) today Hence, DSS is highly required and it can be used for the long-term management of Covid In this study, the rapid classification of normal lung, tuberculosis lung, and Covid-19 lung based on the Chest X-Ray (CXR) image was proposed as the initial step of DSS implementation The proposed image processing based CXR classification using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) obtained the highest accuracy rate of 88 37% This accuracy was obtained in the second scenario with the 208 CXR datasets The small number of datasets used was related to the limited number of CXR Covid-19 images with good quality brightness The proposed system developed is expected to help doctors in diagnose lung disease ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Covid-19 and Tuberculosis Classification Based on Chest X-Ray Using Convolutional Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Hypoplasia of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery is frequently observed in patients with anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms. The effect of this anatomical variant on ACoA aneurysm morphology is not well understood. METHODS Digital subtraction angiography images were reviewed for 204 patients presenting to the authors' institution with either a ruptured or an unruptured ACoA aneurysm. The ratio of the width of the larger A1 segment to the smaller A1 segment was calculated. Patients with an A1 ratio greater than 2 were categorized as having A1 segment hypoplasia. The relationship of A1 segment hypoplasia to both patient and aneurysm characteristics was then assessed. RESULTS Of 204 patients that presented with an ACoA aneurysm, 34 (16.7%) were found to have a hypoplastic A1. Patients with A1 segment hypoplasia were less likely to have a history of smoking (44.1% vs 62.9%, p = 0.0410). ACoA aneurysms occurring in the setting of a hypoplastic A1 were also found to have a larger maximum diameter (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 mm, p = 0.0084). When considered as a continuous variable, increasing A1 ratio was associated with decreasing aneurysm dome-to-neck ratio (p = 0.0289).

The primary outcome was improvement in ataxia as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Secondary outcomes included safety, training adherence, and balance improvements. There were no differences between groups at baseline. Thirty-one participants completed the trial, and there were no training-related serious adverse events. Compliance to training was over 70%. There was a mean improvement in ataxia symptoms of 1.9 SARA points (SD 1.62) in the aerobic group compared to an improvement of 0.6 points (SD 1.34) in the balance group.

The purpose of this study is to facilitate the SMMEs with circular economy (CE) practices to overcome the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on their supply chain (SC) operations. Design/methodology/approach: The presented work identified seven critical impacts as criteria of the novel COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian SMME and seeks to identify the relief measures in the CE paradigm by identifying 13 prominent enablers to CE as alternatives. Experts opinions have been engaged to detect CE enablers proficiency to overpower the pandemic impact through a questionnaire-based survey. The obtained data have been clustered and analyzed through a hybrid approach of entropy weight method and grey relational analysis to find an organized ranking of the enablers. Findings: Current work spotlights the SMMEs losses due to SC disruptions and declined consumption patterns. The waste augmentation during the pandemic era has also been grouped in this study, primarily associating with the SCs waste generation. The result of the performed analysis shows that the CE enabler waste reduction and its transformation into a resource (E1) have achieved the highest rank among all the considered enablers, governing a higher demand toward reusing waste for better handling the post COVID era state of affairs.

COVID-19 disease frequently affects the lungs leading to bilateral viral pneumonia, progressing in some cases to severe respiratory failure requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Risk stratification at ICU admission is fundamental for resource allocation and decision making, considering that baseline comorbidities, age, and patient conditions at admission have been associated to poorer outcomes. Supervised machine learning techniques are increasingly diffuse in clinical medicine and can predict mortality and test associations reaching high predictive performance. We assessed performances of a machine learning approach to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU using data from the Lombardy ICU Network. Methods: this is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from Lombardy ICU network. To predict survival at 7-,14- and 28 days we built two different models;model A included patient demographics, medications before admission and comorbidities, while model B also included the data of the first day since ICU admission. 10-fold cross validation was repeated 2500 times, to ensure optimal hyperparameter choice. The only constrain imposed to model optimization was the choice of logistic regression as final layer to increase clinical interpretability. Different imputation and over-sampling techniques were employed in model training. Results: 1503 patients were included, with 766 deaths (51%). Exploratory analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated mortality association with age and gender. Model A and B reached the greatest predictive performance at 28 days (AUC 0.77 and 0.79), with lower performance at 14 days (AUC 0.72 and 0.74) and 7 days (AUC 0.68 and 0.71). Male gender, age and number of comorbidities were strongly associated with mortality in both models. Among comorbidities, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrated association. Mode of ventilatory assistance at ICU admission and Fraction of Inspired oxygen were associated with mortality in model B. Conclusions: Supervised machine learning models demonstrated good performance in prediction of 28-day mortality. 7-days and 14-days predictions demonstrated lower performance.

The host barriers that drive viral adaptation have predominantly been attributed to restriction factors, rather than cofactors (host proteins exploited to promote viral replication). Here, we consider the role of one cofactor, RanBP2, in providing a barrier that drove viral genome evolution during SIV spillover events. RanBP2 (also known as Nup358) is a component of the nuclear pore complex known to facilitate nuclear entry of HIV-1. Our data suggest that transmission of SIV from monkeys to chimpanzees, and then from chimpanzees to gorillas, both coincided with changes in the viral capsid that allowed interaction with RanBP2 of the new host species. However, human RanBP2 subsequently provided no barrier to the zoonotic transmission of SIV from chimpanzees or gorillas, indicating that chimpanzee- and gorilla-adapted SIVs are pre-adapted to humans in this regard. Our observations are in agreement with RanBP2 driving virus evolution during cross-species transmissions of SIV, particularly in the transmissions to and between great ape species.","output":"Species-specific vulnerability of RanBP2 shaped the evolution of SIV as it transmitted in African apes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unhealthy food marketing shapes childrens preference towards obesogenic foods. In Malaysia, policies regulating this food marketing were rated as poor compared to global standards, justifying the need to explore barriers and facilitators during policy development and implementation processes. The case study incorporated qualitative methods, including historical mapping, semi-structured interviews with key informants and a search of cited documents. Nine participants were interviewed, representing the Federal government (n = 5), food industry (n = 2) and civil society (n = 2). Even though the mandatory approach to government-led regulation of food marketing to children was the benchmark, more barriers than facilitators in the policy process led to industry self-regulations in Malaysia. Cited barriers were the lack of political will, industry resistance, complexity of legislation, technical challenges, and lack of resources, particularly professional skills. The adoption of industry self-regulation created further barriers to subsequent policy advancement. These included implementer indifference (industry), lack of monitoring, poor stakeholder relations, and policy characteristics linked to weak criteria and voluntary uptake. These underlying barriers, together with a lack of sustained public health advocacy, exacerbated policy inertia. Key recommendations include strengthening pro-public health stakeholder partnerships, applying sustained efforts in policy advocacy to overcome policy inertia, and conducting monitoring for policy compliance and accountability.

Recent studies in the literature as well as dramatic changes in clinical practice over the past decade, though, would suggest that such a precise measure by IC to set energy goals is not required to maximize clinical benefit from early feeding in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results from randomized controlled trials evaluating permissive underfeeding, use of supplemental parenteral nutrition to achieve tight calorie control, and caloric density of formulas to increase energy delivery have provided an important perspective on 3 pertinent issues. First, a simple weight-based predictive equation (25 kcal/kg/day) provides a clinically useful approximation of EE. Second, a precise measure of EE by IC does not appear to improve outcomes compared with use of this less accurate estimation of energy requirements. And third, providing some percentage of requirements (50%-80%), achieves similar clinical benefit to full feeding (100%) in the early phases of critical illness. The value from IC use lies in the determination of caloric requirements in conditions for which weight-based equations are rendered inaccurate (anasarca, amputation, severe obesity) or the clinical state is markedly altered (such as the prolonged hyperinflammatory state of coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]).

Aerosol-generating procedures have led to change in safety practices among HCPs. We thus evaluated the efficacy of the endoscopic safety measures among HCPs posted in the endoscopy unit. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all endoscopic procedures performed over a period of 4 months, from 1 April to 31 July 2020 were included. We noted indications and number of COVID-positive procedures as well as comprehensive screening of HCPs posted in our endoscopy unit. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 among HCPs. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and sixty procedures were included in the analysis. Indications were divided as urgent (n = 190, 5.49%), semi-urgent (n = 553, 16%) and non-urgent group (n = 2717, 78.52%). Thirty-four procedures (0.98%) were done on diagnosed COVID-19 patients. The most common indications were gastrointestinal bleed (n = 12/34, 35.30%) followed by biliary sepsis (n = 9/34, 26.5%). Among the HCPs, the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 6.58% (n = 5/76).

Additionally, accurate assessment of the evolution, extent and dynamics of the outbreak are required to understand the transmission of the virus amongst seemingly unrelated cases and provide critical epidemiological information. To address these challenges, we evaluated a new high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS), respiratory viral panel (RVP) that includes 40 viral pathogens with the aim of analyzing viral subtypes, mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, model to understand the spread of the virus in the state of Georgia, USA, and to assess other circulating viruses in the same population. MethodsThis study evaluated a total of 522 samples that included 483 patient samples and 42 synthetic positive control material. The performance metrics were calculated for both clinical and reference control samples by comparing detection results with the RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection (LoD) studies were conducted as per the FDA guidelines. Inference and visualization of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences were performed through the Nextstrain Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, utilizing the associated augur and auspice toolkits. ResultsThe performance metrics calculated using both the clinical samples and the reference controls revealed a PPA, NPA and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96% and 94.4%, respectively. The LoD was determined to be 10 copies/ml with all 25 replicates detected across two different runs. The clade for pangolin lineage B that contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF 3a and, S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation were the most prevalent, early in the pandemic, in Georgia, USA.

Specifically, though vaccine efficacy is typically evaluated as reduction in disease, we also evaluated efficacy against infectiousness given the uncertainty of the vaccine to prevent infectiousness as well as potential effects of waning immunity. Furthermore, we evaluated these potential vaccine properties in three US states at different stages of the epidemic to assess the impact on outcomes from distribution timing.Findings: Increased vaccine efficacy against disease reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19;however, the relative benefit of transmission blocking varied depending on the timing of vaccine distribution. Early in an outbreak, a vaccine that reduces transmission will be relatively more effective than one introduced later in the outbreak. Results from analysis of selected US states further suggest that earlier implementation of a less effective vaccine is more impactful than later implementation of a more effective vaccine. These findings are magnified when considering the durability of the vaccine. Vaccination in the spring will be less impactful when immunity is less durable. Interpretation: Policy choices regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and face mask use, will need to remain in place longer if the vaccine is less effective at reducing transmission.

The goal of this study was to understand knowledge of and attitudes toward urine microscopy among internal medicine residents and to implement virtual urine microscopy teaching sessions. Methods A voluntary, anonymous, online survey was sent to all of the categorical internal medicine residents (n=131) training at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). The survey included 13 questions to assess attitudes toward, experience with, and clinical interpretation of urine microscopy specimens. In response to the survey results, we implemented virtual urine microscopy teaching sessions using video conferencing software that incorporated real-time urine sediment analysis with nephrology fellows and attending nephrologists. Results The survey response rate was 45% (59 of 131). Forty-seven percent (28 of 59) of respondents reported performing urine microscopy at least once during their training, and 75% (44 of 59) of respondents did not feel comfortable performing urine microscopy. The majority of residents (92%; 54 of 59) reported they felt urine microscopy was very helpful or somewhat helpful in the evaluation of patients with AKI. Overall, 41% of responses to clinical interpretation questions were considered correct. Following survey completion, virtual urine microscopy sessions were held monthly and well received by the participants. Conclusions Our study found that internal medicine residents perceive urine microscopy as a helpful diagnostic tool, although lack the skills to perform and interpret urine microscopy sediments.

The fabricated samples were examined for the variation in physical, structural, elastic, and radiation-shielding properties with the Bi(2)O(3) concentration. The structural and compositional evaluations are done using XRD and FTIR spectra. The BZX matrixes consist of the trigonal-planar and tetrahedral groups of borates, BiO(3) and BiO(6) units of Bi(2)O(3), and the non-bridging oxygen in general. The average single-bond strength values substantiate the increasing ionic nature of the BZX glasses. The variation in the density and molar volume of the BZX series discussed in terms of various structural and elastic properties. The glass-coded BZ15 was found to be the best candidate for the sound-resistant applications based on the atomic packing fraction and the acoustic impedance studies. With MCNP5 simulation, the mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) values of all the samples were calculated and compared with a theoretical approach using the XCOM program. As the amount of Bi(2)O(3) increases, the linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) increases with it at all energies. The LAC values varied between 0.2805 and 0.5269 cm(?1) for the investigated glasses at 0.81 MeV. BZ30 glass is the more effective shield due to the highest MAC and LAC values.

Over the past two decades, the role of endoscopes has evolved from a diagnostic tool in the office to the operating room, where Hopkins rod and distal chip scopes are being used to perform routine and complex middle ear and mastoid surgery. Advancements in endoscopic ear surgery techniques have increased interest in endoscopes for in-office otologic procedures. Compared with binocular microscopy, the endoscope provides enhanced depth of field and visualization of the hidden recesses of the middle ear (and mastoid) using small surgical corridors. These advantages are leveraged in the office setting for diagnosing, documenting and managing otologic pathology, even more now during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we describe the indications, techniques and potential complications of office-based otoendoscopy and endoscopic ear surgery.","output":"New perspectives in office-based otoendoscopy and endoscopic ear surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak at the end of 2019, the normalization of the epidemic has posed great challenge to epidemic prevention and control in indoor environment. Ventilation systems are most commonly used to prevent and control indoor transmission of disease. However, most naturally ventilated rooms are not efficient to prevent the spread of virus, i.e., classroom. The goal of this work is to effectively adopt forced interference strategies (e.g., airflow deflector) applied to external windows to strengthen airflow diffusion performance (ADP) of natural ventilation. So far, no systematic study has been done to investigate the effectiveness of such airflow deflectors on its influence on natural ventilation and effectiveness of preventing the disease transmission in indoor environment. In this work, a case study was conducted on a real high-rise building. The target object is a cross-ventilated classroom. Different settings of airflow deflectors (i.e., size and installation angle) were applied to the external window. Air Diffusion Performance Index (ADPI) was deployed to evaluated airflow diffusion performance under different settings of the airflow deflectors. Then, the Wells-Riley model was applied to evaluate infection risks. According to the results, the infection risk can be reduced by 19.29% when source is located at the center of classroom and 17.47% when source is located near the side walls. This work would provide guidance for the design of classroom ventilated with induced wind for epidemic prevention and control.","output":"Airflow deflectors applied to external windows of a classroom ventilated with induced wind: towards COVID-19 prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak and its spread around the globe is significantly affecting mental health and health in general, worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. METHODS: A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second peoples Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zungs self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zungs self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42( 10.99) and 45.23( 11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (p < 0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with it. We should, therefore, pay more attention to the patients psychology, start targeted intervention to alleviate the patients anxiety and further improve their quality of life.","output":"Analysis of the prevalence and influencing factors of depression and anxiety among maintenance dialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has lead to massive public health issues. Face masks have become one of the most efficient ways to reduce coronavirus transmission. This makes face recognition (FR) a challenging task as several discriminative features are hidden. Moreover, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is crucial to ensure the security of FR systems. In contrast to growing numbers of masked FR studies, the impact of masked attacks on PAD has not been explored. Therefore, we present novel attacks with real masks placed on presentations and attacks with subjects wearing masks to reflect the current real-world situation. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of masked attacks on PAD performance by using seven state-of-the-art PAD algorithms under intra- and cross-database scenarios. We also evaluate the vulnerability of FR systems on masked attacks.

However, some known drawbacks limit their use, particularly ethical issues and immunological rejections. Thus, MSCs byproducts, namely Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), are emerging as potential solutions to overcome some of the issues of the original cells. EVs can be modulated by either cellular preconditioning or vesicle engineering, and thus represent a plastic tool to be implemented in regenerative medicine. Further, the use of biomaterials is important to improve EV delivery and indirectly to modulate their content and secretion.

A rapid and convenient point-of-care test (POCT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is of great importance for prompt and efficient control of these respiratory epidemics. Herein, a multichannel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform was developed based on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) array for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1). The developed MEIA was constructed with eight channels and allowed rapid detection on a single array. On the SPCE surface, monoclonal antibodies against influenza A(H1N1) hemagglutinin (HA) protein or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were coated to capture the target antigens, which then interacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody to form an immuno-sandwich complex. The results showed that the MEIA exhibited a broader linear range than ELISA and comparable sensitivity for A(H1N1) HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The detection results on 79 clinical samples for A(H1N1) suggested that the proposed MEIA platform showed comparable results with ELISA in sensitivity (with a positive rate of 100% for positive samples) but higher specificity, with a false-positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples versus that of 40.5% with ELISA. Thus, it offers great potential for the on-the-spot differential diagnosis of infected patients, which would significantly benefit the efficient control and prevent the spread of these infectious diseases in communities or resource-limited regions in the future.","output":"Multichannel Immunosensor Platform for the Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats to human beings in terms of health care, economy, and society in recent history. Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Tweet Topics and Sentiments Relating to COVID-19 Vaccination Among Australian Twitter Users: Machine Learning Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media is now the primary form of communication between internet users and has soared in popularity, which has directly impacted the spread of the phenomenon of fake news. Fake news is not only a widespread phenomenon; it is also problematic and dangerous for society. The aim of this study is to understand the phenomenon of fake news better. The study utilised a structural modelling equation in order to identify how Polish society perceives the problem of fake news and assess the extent to which it trusts content that is published on the internet. The key goal was to determine what factors have the most significant influence on the verification of information being viewed on the internet. By deploying the partial least squares method of validation, SmartPLS3 software was used to process the survey results. The strongest positive effect on information verification behaviour was found to be fake news awareness, which was followed by the intention to share information. The research did not consider any clear connections that may exist between the nature of fake news and its recipient; however, much of the fake news that appears on the internet is political in nature. The study can be used by news reporting companies and provides preliminary information for developers responsible for running social media sites as well as users who want to combat and limit the spread of fake news online.

These changes have also exacerbated existing disparities in access to social and environmental supports for physical activity, potentially contributing to a widening gap in physical activity participation among those at greatest risk for COVID-19. Physical activity can play a special role in reducing the inequitable consequences of COVID-19;however, expansion and better targeting of evidence-informed interventions are needed that address the unique barriers present in communities that have been economically and socially marginalized to achieve health equity in COVID-19 outcomes. This review highlights effective and feasible strategies that provide more equitable access to physical activity programs and spaces across the United States. With a renewed investment in physical activity, this behavior can play a crucial role in improving population health and reducing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"COVID-19: Implications for Physical Activity, Health Disparities, and Health Equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is common in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities (1-3). On September 17, 2020, a Utah correctional facility (facility A) received a report of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dental health care provider (DHCP) who had treated incarcerated persons at facility A on September 14, 2020 while asymptomatic. On September 21, 2020, the roommate of an incarcerated person who had received dental treatment experienced COVID-19-compatible symptoms*; both were housed in block 1 of facility A (one of 16 occupied blocks across eight residential units). Two days later, the roommate received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, becoming the first person with a known-associated case of COVID-19 at facility A. During September 23-24, 2020, screening of 10 incarcerated persons who had received treatment from the DHCP identified another two persons with COVID-19, prompting isolation of all three patients in an unoccupied block at the facility. Within block 1, group activities were stopped to limit interaction among staff members and incarcerated persons and prevent further spread. During September 14-24, 2020, six facility A staff members, one of whom had previous close contact? with one of the patients, also reported symptoms. On September 27, 2020, an outbreak was confirmed after specimens from all remaining incarcerated persons in block 1 were tested; an additional 46 cases of COVID-19 were identified, which were reported to the Salt Lake County Health Department and the Utah Department of Health.

Baricitinib, a janus kinases inhibitor, can potentially suppress inflammatory cascades in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of high dose of baricitinib with its usual dose in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This prospective cohort study was conducted on 238 adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight milligram and 4 mg of baricitinib was given orally to 122 patients in the high dose (HD) group and 116 patients the usual dose (UD) group, respectively daily for 14 days, and clinical outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Blood oxygen saturation level was stabilized (&#8805;94% on room air) earlier in the HD group compared to the UD group [5 (IQR: 4-5)/8 (IQR: 6-9), P < 0.05]. Patients in the HD group required intensive care unit (ICU) and intubation supports more in the UD group than that in patients of the HD group [17.2%/9%, P < 0.05; 11.2%/4.1%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. The 30-day mortality and 60-day rehospitalization rate were higher in the UD group than the HD group [6%/3.3%, P < 0.01; 11.9%/7.6%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The daily high dose of baricitinib in severe COVID-19 results in early stabilization of the respiratory functions, declined requirements of critical care supports, reduced rehospitalization with mortality rate compared to its daily usual dose.","output":"Impact of high dose of baricitinib in severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective cohort study in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Pulmonary fibrosis is an infamous sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia leading to long-lasting respiratory problems and activity limitations. Pulmonary rehabilitation is beneficial to improve the symptoms of lung fibrosis. We experienced a post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis patient who received a structured exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation program. Patient concerns: This article presents a case of successful pulmonary rehabilitation of a patient with post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. The patient could not cut off the oxygen supplement even after a successful recovery from COVID-19. Diagnosis: Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pulmonary fibrosis was diagnosed by patient's complaint, clinical appearance, and computed tomography (CT) on chest. Intervention: The patient underwent ten sessions of exercise-based rehabilitation program according to Consensus Document on Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Korea, 2015. Outcome: On the 8th day, he could cut off the oxygen supplementation and complete the one-hour exercise without oxygen. He was discharged after completing the 10-session program without any activity limitations. Lessons: Exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation will help the post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis patients.

As some AgPOCTs have become available, interest is growing in their utility and performance. Here we aimed to compare the analytical sensitivity and specificity of seven commercially available AgPOCT devices. Methods: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we compared AgPOCT products from seven suppliers: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, the RapiGEN BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag, the Healgen Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab), the Coris BioConcept COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, the R-Biopharm RIDA QUICK SARS-CoV-2 Antigen, the nal von minden NADAL COVID-19 Ag Test, and the Roche-SD Biosensor SARS-CoV Rapid Antigen Test. Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results. Findings: In 138 clinical samples with quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, the 95% limit of detection (concentration at which 95% of test results were positive) in six of seven AgPOCT products ranged between 207  106 and 286  107 copies per swab, with an outlier (RapiGEN) at 157  1010 copies per swab. The assays showed no cross-reactivity towards cell culture or tissue culture supernatants containing any of the four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1) or MERS-CoV, with the exception of the Healgen assay in one repeat test on HCoV-HKU1 supernatant. SARS-CoV was cross-detected by all assays. Cumulative specificities among stored clinical samples with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=100) and self-samples from healthy volunteers (n=35; cumulative sample n=135) ranged between 985% (95% CI 942-997) and 1000% (972-1000) in five products, with two outliers at 948% (892-977; R-Biopharm) and 889% (821-934; Healgen). False-positive results did not appear to be associated with any specific respiratory pathogen. Interpretation: The sensitivity range of most AgPOCTs overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads typically observed in the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in most patients. The AgPOCTs with limit of detections that approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious might enable shortcuts in decision making in various areas of health care and public health.

De-implementation, the reduction or removal of a healthcare practice that offers little to no benefit or causes harm, is an emerging field of research. Little is known about the factors which (i) sustain LVC; and (ii) the magnitude of the problem of LVC. In addition, little is known about the processes of de-implementation, and if and how these processes differ from implementation endeavours. The objective of this study was to explicate the myriad factors which impact the processes and outcomes of de-implementation initiatives that are designed to address national Choosing Wisely campaign recommendations. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals implementing Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations in healthcare settings in four provinces. The interview guide was developed using concepts from the literature and the Implementation Process Model (IPM) as a framework. All interviews were conducted virtually, recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Seventeen Choosing Wisely team members were interviewed. Participants identified numerous provider factors, most notably habit, which sustain LVC. Contrary to reporting in recent studies, the majority of LVC in the sample was not patient facing; therefore, patients were not a significant driver for the LVC, nor a barrier to reducing it. Participants detailed aspects of the magnitude of the problems of LVC, providing insight into the complexities and nuances of harm, resources and prevalence. Harm from potential or common infections, reactions, or overtreatment was viewed as the most significant types of harm. Unique factors influencing the processes of de-implementation reported were: influence of Choosing Wisely campaigns, availability of data, lack of targets and hard-coded interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This study explicates factors ranging from those which impact the maintenance of LVC to factors that impact the success of de-implementation interventions intended to reduce them. The findings draw attention to the significance of unintentional factors, highlight the importance of understanding the impact of harm and resources to reduce LVC and illuminate the overstated impact of patients in de-implementation literature. These findings illustrate the complexities of de-implementation.

Therefore, this study explores intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence among Bahraini women, predictors of IPV, and reliability of the Women Abuse Screening Tool (WAST) questionnaire in IPV against women. METHODS: The current prospective cross-sectional study included 810 Bahraini women meeting the inclusion criteria, who were asked to share any IPV experience witnessed during their marriage. A questionnaire comprising of 25 questions, including those of WAST-short and WAST-long, was used. The reliability of the screening tools was determined using Cronbach's alpha test. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPV among Bahraini was found to be 71.11%. During pregnancy, husbands' violent behavior towards family members, relatives or friends; escalation of violence; substance abuse; general antisocial behavior; criminality and mental health issues were significantly associated with IPV (P < 0.001). Relationship problems with the husband, individual behavior of women supporting violence, and history of violence from other family members were significantly associated with abuse (P < 0.05). WAST-short was shown to have a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 18.8%. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the full questionnaire, WAST-short and WAST-long were 0.82, 0.76, and 0.84, respectively.

This approach is based on critical discourse analysis of legal documents and court decisions that feature people with the poor mental health. Namely, we suggest how to measure the level or degree of judiciarization, its geographical evenness, actors in the legal process, its dimensions (the law branches of its occurrence), and linguistic content. We applied this methodology in examining 1,243 legal documents and 327,311 court decisions that were issued by agents of the Russian law system.

Rates of salmonellosis vary across the Australian states and territories, with the highest rates in the Northern Territory. In 2020, to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Australia implemented public health measures including border closures, physical distancing and hygiene advice. This study analyses salmonellosis notification rates in 2020 and considers possible impacts of COVID-19 measures. Methods Monthly and annual salmonellosis notifications per 100,000 population, for each of Australia's eight states and territories for the years 2015 to 2020, were extracted from Australia's publicly accessible National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. For each jurisdiction, the salmonellosis rate each month in 2020 was compared with the previous 5-year median rate for that calendar month. The possible impacts of COVID-19 public health measures on salmonellosis notifications in the respective states and territories were examined. Results The annual Australian salmonellosis notification rate was 27% lower in 2020 than the previous 5-year median. The reduction in salmonellosis rate varied throughout Australia. States and territories with more stringent, more frequent or longer COVID-19 public health measures had generally greater salmonellosis rate reductions. However, Tasmania had a 50% deeper reduction in salmonellosis rate than did the Northern Territory, despite similar restriction levels. Conclusions Salmonellosis notifications decreased in Australia during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction in notifications corresponded with the implementation of public health measures.

COVID was first detected in Ireland on 29/2/20. Many oncology units saw dramatic changes in activity in the face of rising infection rates. We aim to assess compare pharmacy activity, day unit systemic therapy adminstration and nursing staffing levels during the pre- and COVID periods. Methods: Hospital information systems were used to retrieve numbers of patients attending, numbers and types of items dispensed by pharmacy, and available nurses to deliver the systemic therapies from March 2019 to Feb. 2021. The data was analysed to identify trends in prescribing and dispensing practices for this period. Supportive medications such as anti-emetics, bisphosphosphonates were not included. Subgroup analysis on numbers of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody drugs dispensed per month was performed. A paired t-test was used to compare means. Results: 9410 non-clinical trials and 411 clinical trials items were dispensed from March 2019 until February 2020 (pre-COVID) for 11,606 patient attendances. From March 2020 until February 2021 (COVID period), 8931 non-clinical trials and 826 clinical trials items were dispensed for 10818 patient attendances. The mean number of non-clinical trials items dispensed per month were 784 and 744 respectively, with no statistical difference being found (p=0.11).

Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). METHODS: From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged &#8805;60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. FINDINGS: The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. INTERPRETATION: In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly. FUNDING: None.

Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitude of students towards COVID- 19 at Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. Methods: This descriptive correlational study was conducted on 151 students of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences from July 8 to July 14 in 2020. Convenience sampling was conducted based on the census method after completing and signing a consent form. The data were collected using an online questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS 61 software and the statistical tests of Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson correlation. (P-value0.05). Results: The total mean scores of the students' knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 were 80.265.02 and 16.051.65, respectively. A positive and significant relationship was found between the students' total scores of attitude and knowledge towards COVID-19 (r=0.35, P&lt;0.05). The total score of knowledge was significantly associated with the field of study (P=0.004), employment in medical centers (P=0.004), and voluntarily working during the pandemic (P=0.039). Conclusion: The present findings indicated that the students were equipped with the right knowledge and attitude towards the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this research was to develop an experimental model for testing the spread of viruses during USS instrumentation and to examining the prevention of spreading by replacing the coolant with an antiviral agent. In a virus transmission tunnel, USS operation with saline coolant and delivery of a viral suspension to the vicinity of USS tip generated droplets and aerosol containing Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV). Evaluation of droplet transmission was evaluated with adherent 48h cell culture monolayer RK13 cell lines in standard 48-well-plates positioned at a distance from 30 to 55 cm. The aerosol was collected by a cyclone aero-sampler flow of 100l/min. Antiviral activity of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or electrolyzed water (EOW) was tested by suspension test. The two tested antiviral agents transmission prevention ability was evaluated by repeating the same experiment as with saline coolant. All experiments were repeated twice. With saline coolant, the cytopathic effect on cells was found in cells up to the distance of 45 cm, with the number of infected wells decreasing with distance. Viral particles were detected in only one AS in a very low concentration (4.2 TCID50/ml). In suspension test of 0.25% NaOCl and EOW, the TCID50/ml was below detection limit after 5s. With both antiviral agents, no cytopathic effect was found. However, the cytotoxic effect of 0.25% NaOCl was evident up to the distance of 35 cm. By USS activity, EAV could be transmitted by droplets up to a distance of 45 cm. Both antiviral agents could prevent virus droplet transmission.

This living systematic review presents the most current and seminal information coming from the scientific literature. It is the monthly update of the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action Steering Committee. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to September 30th, 2020. METHODS: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action was applied. The most important medical databases were searched, and papers related to COVID19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 2526 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1150 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 37 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (78.4%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (22.6%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies described patients in acute (51.4%) or subacute (35.0%) phase, while no studies described the chronic consequences of COVID-19. Just one study dealt with rehabilitation interventions regarding COVID-19, and two discussed reorganization of rehabilitative services. CONCLUSIONS: The most recently published COVID-19 research focuses more on describing the clinical presentations and the natural history of the pathology, rather than rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, longterm monitoring, or new organization models remain lacking.","output":"Rehabilitation and COVID-19: a rapid living systematic review 2020 by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field.

To save time, personnel, and financial resources, rapid reviews streamline the methodological steps of the systematic review process. We aimed to explore the validity of a rapid review approach that combines a substantially abbreviated literature search with a single-reviewer screening of abstracts and full texts using three case studies. METHODS We used a convenience sample of three ongoing Cochrane reviews as reference standards. Two reviews addressed oncological topics and one addressed a public health topic. For each of the three topics, three reviewers screened the literature independently. Our primary outcome was the change in conclusions between the rapid reviews and the respective Cochrane reviews. In case the rapid approach missed studies, we recalculated the meta-analyses for the main outcomes and asked Cochrane review authors if the new body of evidence would change their original conclusion compared with the reference standards. Additionally, we assessed the sensitivity of the rapid review approach compared with the results of the original Cochrane reviews. RESULTS For the two oncological topics (case studies 1 and 2), the three rapid reviews each yielded the same conclusions as the Cochrane reviews. However, the authors would have had less certainty about their conclusion in case study 2. For case study 3, the public health topic, only one of the three rapid reviews led to the same conclusion as the Cochrane review. The other two rapid reviews provided insufficient information for the authors to draw conclusions. Using the rapid review approach, the sensitivity was 100% (3 of 3) for case study 1. For case study 2, the three rapid reviews identified 40% (4 of 10), 50% (5 of 10), and 60% (6 of 10) of the included studies, respectively; for case study 3, the respective numbers were 38% (8 of 21), 43% (9 of 21), and 48% (10 of 21). CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of these case studies, a rapid review approach that combines abbreviated literature searches with single-reviewer screening may be feasible for focused clinical questions. For complex public health topics, sensitivity seems to be insufficient.","output":"Combining abbreviated literature searches with single-reviewer screening: three case studies of rapid reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dromedary camels are the natural reservoirs of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries. Real- time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries. Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built. The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences. Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels.

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between 17 July and 10 September 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 to assess MMD. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Cear, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-seven mother-child pairs completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 155 % higher (95 % CI 59, 251, P value < 0001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared with November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 402 % higher during the pandemic (95 % CI 326, 478, P value < 0001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD.

We present here a complete generative model that describes how confidence judgments result from some confidence evidence. The model that generates confidence evidence has two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost. Confidence noise reduces the sensitivity to the confidence evidence, and confidence boost accounts for information used for confidence judgment which was not used for the perceptual decision. The opposite effect of these two parameters creates a problem of confidence parameters indeterminacy, where the confidence in a perceptual decision is the same in spite of differences in confidence noise and confidence boost. When confidence is estimated for multiple stimulus strengths, both of these parameters can be recovered, thus allowing us to estimate whether confidence is generated using the same primary information that was used for the perceptual decision or some secondary information. We also describe a novel measure of confidence efficiency relative to the ideal confidence observer, as well as the estimate of one type of confidence bias. Finally, we apply the model to the confidence forced-choice paradigm, a paradigm that provides objective estimates of confidence, and we discuss how each parameter of the model can be recovered using this paradigm.

Study design Retrospective observational study. Methods Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 was analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. Results The study included 336 black and 408 white patients. Black patients were younger (62.9 +/- 15.0 years vs 71.8 +/- 16.4, P<.001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4 +/- 8.6 vs 28.8 +/- 7.5, P<.001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P=.02) and presented later (6.6 +/-5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4 +/- 5.4, P=.006) compared to white patients. Younger black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age< 65, 69.9%) than older black patients (age>65, 39.2%) and younger white patients (age<65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P=.08).

Those who are moderately to severely ill with COVID-19 are likely to develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and require administration of supplemental oxygen. Assessing the need to initiate or titrate oxygen therapy is largely dependent on evaluating the patient's existing blood oxygenation status, either by direct arterial blood sampling or by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation monitoring, also referred to as pulse oximetry. While the sampling of arterial blood for measurement of dissolved gases provides a direct measurement, it is technically challenging to obtain, is painful to the patient, and can be time and resource intensive. Pulse oximetry allows for non-invasive, real-time, continuous monitoring of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are saturated with oxygen, and usually closely predicts the arterial oxygen content. As such, it was particularly concerning when patients with severe COVID-19 requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within one of our intensive care units were observed to have significant discordance between their predicted arterial oxygen content via pulse oximetry and their actual measured oxygen content. We offer these preliminary observations along with our speculative causes as a timely, urgent clinical need. In the setting of a COVID-19 intensive care unit, entering a patient room to obtain a fresh arterial blood gas sample not only takes exponentially longer to do given the time required for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), it involves the consumption of already sparce PPE, and it increases the risk of viral exposure to the nurse, physician, or respiratory therapist entering the room to obtain the sample. As such, technology similar to pulse oximetry which can be applied to a patients finger, and then continuously monitored from outside the room is essential in preventing a particularly dangerous situation of unrealized hypoxia in this critically-ill patient population. Additionally, it would appear that conventional two-wavelength pulse oximetry may not accurately predict the arterial oxygen content of blood in these patients. This discordance of oxygenation measurements poses a critical concern in the evaluation and management of the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure seen in patients with COVID-19.","output":"An Evolving Clinical Need: Discordant Oxygenation Measurements of Intubated COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is considered to be less invasive and have less morbidity than conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). However, there is a relative paucity of data regarding postoperative pain scores in rural Indian populations following SILC. Also, data pertaining to the applicability of SILC in rural Indian population are scant. METHODS In the present randomized control trial, pain scores after SILC and CLC were evaluated. Sixty patients with gallstone disease were randomly assigned to one of two groups with 30 patients each: the CLC group and the SILC group. Postoperative pain scores were recorded on the visual analog scale at 8 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The patients were comparable with respect to age, sex and BMI. Operative time was longer for the SILC group (47.73  5.57 min vs 69.53  8.96 min; P < 0.0001).The pain scores were similar in both groups at 8 hours (3.61  0.41 vs 3.50  0.51; P = 0.36) and 24 hours (3.30  0.59 vs 3.20  0.40; P = 0.44) postoperatively.

Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimers disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. METHODS: We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision & hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). RESULTS: The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

Equivalent groundbreaking structures in the cellular immune system appeared some 15-20 years later and illustrated how processed protein antigens in the form of peptides are presented by MHC molecules to T cell receptors. Structures of antigen receptors in the innate immune system then explained their inherent specificity for particular microbial antigens including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, small molecules, and specific proteins. These two sides of the immune system act immediately (innate) to particular microbial antigens or evolve (adaptive) to attain high specificity and affinity to a much wider range of antigens.

IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune cells and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is a NF-B target, simultaneous activation of NF-B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-B activation by the IL-6CSTAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6CSTAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases.","output":"Interleukin 6 in inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a high prevalence of human herpesviruses in lung samples of IPF patients but this does not differ from controls, neither regarding prevalence, viral load levels nor co-infection rates.

Peri-urban settings in Kenya have been reported to exhibit higher rates of maternal death during labor and childbirth as compared to the general Kenyan population. Although research indicates that women in Kenya have increased access to facility-based birth in recent years, a small percentage still give birth outside of the health facility due to access challenges and poor maternal health service quality. Most studies assessing facility-based births have focused on the sociodemographic determinants of birthing location. Few studies have assessed womens user experiences and perceptions of quality of care during childbirth. Understanding womens experiences can provide different stakeholders with strategies to structure the provision of maternity care to be person-centered and to contribute to improvements in womens satisfaction with health services and maternal health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, whereby 70 women from the peri-urban area of Embakasi in the East side of Nairobi City in Kenya were interviewed. Respondents were aged 18 to 49 years and had delivered in a health facility in the preceding six weeks. We conducted in-depth interviews with women who gave birth at both public and private health facilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Braune and Clarkes guidelines for thematic analysis were used to generate themes from the interview data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis. Women had positive experiences when care was person-centeredi.e. responsive, dignified, supportive, and with respectful communication. They had negative experiences when they were mistreated, which was manifested as non-responsive care (including poor reception and long wait times), non-dignified care (including verbal and physical abuse lack of privacy and confidentiality), lack of respectful communication, and lack of supportive care (including being denied companions, neglect and abandonment, and poor facility environment). CONCLUSION: To sustain the gains in increased access to facility-based births, there is a need to improve person-centered care to ensure women have positive facility-based childbirth experiences.

We set out to determine the course of these variables during the first pandemic year. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using routine health care data from the Julius General Practitioners Network. All patients registered in the pre-pandemic year (n = 425,129) and/or during the first pandemic year (n = 432,122) were included. Relative risks for the number of infectious disease episodes (respiratory tract/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and skin), in total and those treated with antibiotics, and proportions of episodes treated with antibiotics (prescription rates) were calculated. Compared to the pre-pandemic year, primary care presentation for common infections remained lower during the full first pandemic year (RR, 0.77; CI, 0.76C0.78), mainly attributed to a sustained decline in respiratory tract/ear and gastrointestinal infection episodes. Presentation for urinary tract and skin infection episodes declined during the first wave, but returned to pre-pandemic levels during the second and start of the third wave. Antibiotic prescription rates were lower during the full first pandemic year (24%) as compared to the pre-pandemic year (28%), mainly attributed to a 10% lower prescription rate for respiratory tract/ear infections; the latter was not accompanied by an increase in complications. The decline in primary care presentation for common infections during the full first COVID-19 pandemic year, together with lower prescription rates for respiratory tract/ear infections, resulted in a substantial reduction in antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care.","output":"Common Infections and Antibiotic Prescribing during the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Primary Care-Based Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategies for drug discovery and repositioning are urgently need with respect to COVID-19 Here we present REDIAL-2020, a suite of computational models for estimating small molecule activities in a range of SARS-CoV-2-related assays Models were trained using publicly available, high-throughput screening data and by employing different descriptor types and various machine learning strategies Here we describe the development and use of eleven models that span across the areas of viral entry, viral replication, live virus infectivity, in vitro infectivity and human cell toxicity REDIAL-2020 is available as a web application through the DrugCentral web portal (http://drugcentral org/Redial) The web application also provides similarity search results that display the most similar molecules to the query, as well as associated experimental data REDIAL-2020 can serve as a rapid online tool for identifying active molecules for COVID-19 treatment ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","output":"A machine learning platform to estimate anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Empiric antibiotics for community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) are often prescribed to patients with COVID-19, despite a low reported incidence of co-infections. Stewardship interventions targeted at facilitating appropriate antibiotic prescribing for CABP among COVID-19 patients are needed. We developed a guideline for antibiotic initiation and discontinuation for CABP in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of this intervention on the duration of empiric CABP antibiotic therapy among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study of adult patients admitted between 3/1/2020 to 4/25/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. Patients were excluded if they were initiated on antibiotics > 48 h following admission or if another source of infection was identified. The primary outcome was the duration of antibiotic therapy (DOT) prior to the guideline (March 1 to March27, 2020) and after guideline implementation (March 28 to April 25, 2020). We also evaluated the clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions, length of stay) among those initiated on empiric CABP antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, 102 pre-intervention and 404 post-intervention. Prior to the intervention, 74.5% (n = 76) of patients with COVID-19 received empiric antibiotics compared to only 42% of patients post-intervention (n = 170), p < 0.001. The median DOT in the post-intervention group was 1.3 days shorter (p < 0.001) than the pre-intervention group, and antibiotics directed at atypical bacteria DOT was reduced by 2.8 days (p < 0.001). More patients in the post-intervention group were initiated on antibiotics based on criteria consistent with our guideline (68% versus 87%, p = 0.001). There were no differences between groups in terms of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Following the implementation of a guideline outlining recommendations for initiating and discontinuing antibiotics for CABP among COVID-19 inpatients, we observed a reduction in antibiotic prescribing and DOT. The guideline also resulted in a significant increase in the rate of guideline-congruent empiric antibiotic initiation.","output":"Reducing the use of empiric antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 on hospital admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since 1 January 2005, bariatric surgery has been monitored in Germany. All related data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS Data collection regarding obesity and metabolic surgery was started in an online database in 2005. Follow-up data are collected once a year. Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. RESULTS Since 2005, 10,330 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures have been performed in Germany. In total, 8,013 patients were female and 2,317 were male. Male patients suffered significantly more comorbidities than female patients. The men also had higher body mass indexes (BMIs) and ages than the women at the time of operation. Data on the gender-specific aspects of RYGB from the Nationwide Survey of Bariatric Surgery in Germany (GBSR) showed a significant difference in anastomotic insufficiency at the gastro-entero-anastomosis. The leakage rate was 2.37 % (55/2,317) in men and 1.68 % (135/8,013) in women. Additionally, specific complication and mortality rates were significantly higher in male than in female patients. CONCLUSIONS Metabolic and obesity surgery is becoming increasingly popular in Germany. Data from the GBSR show significant differences in preoperative comorbidities and postoperative complication and mortality rates between male and female patients.

In Spain, knowledge about the use of antibiotics is scarce, being the third country with the highest consumption of antibiotics in the world and the first in Europe. This problem is due, partly, to the abusive use of these drugs in human medicine, livestock, and agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact that the Tiny Earth project has had on the antibiotic knowledge in pre-university students. To do this, a survey was conducted before and after the Tiny Earth project in three different school years (2017C2020) to 322 pre-university students belonging to seven schools in the province of Valencia. The survey consisted of 12 multiple-choice questions with a single valid answer. We observed 67.6% success at the beginning and 81.2% at the end. These data indicate that they correctly answered an average of 1.64 more questions after completing the project.

Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much early attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), which is a well-known cardiometabolic risk factor. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the impact of additional baseline cardiometabolic risk factors including high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. METHODS: We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry. RESULTS: Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p < 0.05) while HDL-C and ApoA-I were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL-C was controlled, the effect of HDL-C remained significant when BMI was controlled for. LDL-C, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds. CONCLUSION: Elevated HDL-C and ApoA-I levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of BMI, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL-C, suggesting that these effects may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL-C levels. In summary, our study suggests that baseline HDL-C level may be useful for stratifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and corroborates the emerging picture that HDL-C may confer protection against sepsis in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular.","output":"Baseline cardiometabolic profiles and SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a mental health burden worldwide.

syndrome, sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction contribute much to the pathophysiologies of severe COVID-19. These severe patients have similar clinical manifestations with patients suffering from certain auto-inflammatory disorders and cytokine storm syndromes. Interestingly, anakinra (blocking both IL-1 and IL-1) has shown promises in treating these patients with hyperinflammatory disorders, sepsis with multiorgan failures. Another inflammasome, AIM2, involved in production of IL-1 has also been found to be implicated in COVID-19. IL-1, a known procoagulant, causes induction of tissue factor with increasing vascular endothelial permeability loss ensuing in hypercoagulability-one of the cardinal features of the disease. Hence, anakinra a 17kD recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, used widely in Rheumatoid Arthritis treatments might prove efficacious in attenuating the hyperinflammatory state of the disease. Indeed, some of the controlled clinical trials have shown anakinra to effectively decrease mortality and hospital stay. Targeted cytokine blocking are always preferable in comparison with non-specific blocking (steroids) as it is more restrained with the chances of dampening of systemic immune system being much less. Early cell death and neutrophil migration have been one of the pivotal events in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Hence, suPAR levels which measures IL-1 (necroptosis) and S100A8/A9 (neutrophil migration) can perhaps be a good early biomarker predicting the disease progression. Lastly and importantly, as the vaccines are raised against spike protein and the different variants of concern are known to evade the neutralizing antibodies by varying degrees, it will be deserving to assess anakinra, against the variants of concern as an immunomodulatory drug.","output":"Could anakinra outmatch dexamethasone/tocilizumab in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Sedentary behaviour is associated with increased risk for lower health status and all-cause mortality. Older adults spend up to 75%, on average, of their day sedentary, however little is known about interventions designed to decrease sitting time for this population.Methods: A scoping review was conducted to broadly determine what is known about sedentary behaviour interventions for older adults. Electronic databases were searched for articles with eligibility criteria including: (1) interventions containing strategies to decrease sedentary behaviour, (2) adults 60 years of age, and (3) reported outcome measures related to sedentary behaviour.Results: A total of 32 articles met the inclusion criteria. While methodological quality and intervention characteristics varied among the studies, the majority of interventions used a multi-component approach. Interventions involved a variety of behavioural change strategies with goal setting, information and self-monitoring the most frequently used. Of the 20 studies reporting results, 80% (n = 16) found at least one significant change in sedentary behaviour.Conclusion: Findings from this scoping review suggest that sedentary behaviour can be reduced in community-dwelling older adults through multi-component targeted interventions. Future work is needed to examine sedentary behaviour interventions for adults >75 years and for persons living in long-term care institutions.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONOlder adults spend up to 75% of their day sedentary and are at an increased risk for chronic conditions, functional limitations, and mortality.Multi-component sedentary behaviour interventions, such as education, physical activity, and activity monitoring should be implemented for older adults.When designing interventions, incorporating goal-setting, self-monitoring and other behaviour change strategies can reduce sitting time for older adults.","output":"Interventions to address sedentary behaviour for older adults: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological studies have shown a dramatic increase in the incidence and the prevalence of allergic diseases over the last several decades. Environmental triggers including risk factors (e.g., pollution), the loss of rural living conditions (e.g., farming conditions), and nutritional status (e.g., maternal, breastfeeding) are considered major contributors to this increase. The influences of these environmental factors are thought to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms which are heritable, reversible, and biologically relevant biochemical modifications of the chromatin carrying the genetic information without changing the nucleotide sequence of the genome. An important feature characterizing epigenetically-mediated processes is the existence of a time frame where the induced effects are the strongest and therefore most crucial. This period between conception, pregnancy, and the first years of life (e.g., first 1000 days) is considered the optimal time for environmental factors, such as nutrition, to exert their beneficial epigenetic effects. In the current review, we discussed the impact of the exposure to bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungal components, microbiome metabolites, and specific nutritional components (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), vitamins, plant- and animal-derived microRNAs, breast milk) on the epigenetic patterns related to allergic manifestations. We gave insight into the epigenetic signature of bioactive milk components and the effects of specific nutrition on neonatal T cell development. Several lines of evidence suggest that atypical metabolic reprogramming induced by extrinsic factors such as allergens, viruses, pollutants, diet, or microbiome might drive cellular metabolic dysfunctions and defective immune responses in allergic disease. Therefore, we described the current knowledge on the relationship between immunometabolism and allergy mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The knowledge as presented will give insight into epigenetic changes and the potential of maternal and post-natal nutrition on the development of allergic disease.","output":"Perinatal and Early-Life Nutrition, Epigenetics, and Allergy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>Public-rented flats in Jakarta Province operated by the Management Unit of Public-Rented Flats (MUPRF) experienced budget cuts for the maintenance and treatment activities during the COVID-19 pandemic that hit Indonesia in the early 2020.

In this cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with different levels of psychological impact as a result of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. From April 1 to 30, 2020, we used a self-administered online questionnaire to collect data from 10,609 respondents. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents, we categorized the levels of impact as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the associated factors. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe psychological impact was 10.2%, 4.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of reporting normal vs mild, moderate, or severe psychological impact were 5.9 times higher for people living in the Chittagong Division, 1.7 times higher for women with lower education levels, 3.0 times higher among those who were divorced or separated, 1.8 times higher for those working full time, and 2.4 times higher for those living in shared apartments. The odds of reporting a psychological impact were also higher among people who did not enforce protective measures inside the home, those in self-quarantine, those who did not wear face masks, and those who did not comply with World Health Organization precautionary measures. Increased psychological health risks due to COVID-19 were significantly higher among people who experienced chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulties, dizziness, and sore throat before data collection.

Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China. METHODS A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. RESULTS A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era.

Lebanon has taken in more Syrian refugees per capita than any other nation. We aimed to study the burden of surgical disease and access to surgical care among Syrian refugees in Lebanon. METHODS: This study was designed as a convenient cross-sectional cluster-based population survey of all refugee camps throughout the Bekaa region of Lebanon. We used a modified version of the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need to identify surgical conditions and barriers to care access. The head of household of each informal tented settlement provided demographic information after which two household members were randomly chosen and administered the survey. RESULTS: A total of 1,500 individuals from 750 households representing 21 camps were surveyed. Respondents had a mean age of 36.6 (15.0) years, 54.6% were female, and 59% were illiterate. Nearly 25% of respondents reported at least one surgical condition within the past year, most commonly involving the face, head, and neck region (32%) and extremities (22%). Less than 20% of patients with a surgical condition reported seeing any healthcare provider, > 75% due to financial hardship. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of surgical disease among Syrian refugees is very high with a fourth of refugees suffering from one or more surgical conditions over the past year. The surgical needs of this vulnerable population are largely unmet as financial reasons prevent patients from seeking care.

Our objective was to produce the Periodontal Senior Case Clinical Challenge (PSCCC) that would provide fourth-year students an alternative for senior case presentations and would be a formative assessment for which student opinions would be provided and analyzed. The PSCCC would utilize an online, case-based, written, clinical assessment, and follow-up, structured discussion to challenge students to demonstrate ability to apply didactic periodontal knowledge to patient-based experiences. We hypothesized the PSCCC would provide effective learning and a formative assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Relevant didactic resources were distributed to 48 students for independent review. The PSCCC was delivered in two sections, (1) a case-based assessment via a virtual classroom with written student responses, and (2) oral discussions conducted via virtual meetings that were moderated and assessed by ten periodontists, with the collaboration of nine residents. A voluntary six-statement survey was used to evaluate the students' opinions of the PSCCC. The scores for 75% (36/48) of students who participated were evaluated for statistical and clinical importance. RESULTS The value of our PSCCC was supported by 91.7% (33/36) of the analyses (P  0.0008). DISCUSSION The PSCCC was a successful alternative pathway to assess students' clinical and didactic integrated knowledge in periodontics. It provided a unified vision of treatment of the selected case, building on all aspects of the students' periodontal education while allowing interaction in a simultaneous, three-tiered educational approach, involving dental students, periodontal residents, and faculty. CONCLUSION In support of our hypothesis, for each of the 6 statements,  94.44% (34/36) of the scores given by the students were considered exceptionally strong clinical support for our pedagogical strategy that combines educational resources and can be successfully implemented in other programs.","output":"THE PERIODONTAL SENIOR CASE CLINICAL challenge: students' Opinions of a formative virtual Assessment during the COVID-19 emergency."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hardness and elastic modulus of spruce wood cell walls parallel to their axial direction were investigated by means of nanoindentation.

METHODS Four radiologists retrospectively evaluated the chest CT examinations of 178 patients. The study included 143 patients with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and 35 patients whose RT-PCR tests were negative but whose clinical and/or radiological findings were consistent with COVID-19. Fleiss' kappa () values were calculated, and individual observers' scores were compared. To investigate diagnostic efficiency, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for each interpreter. RESULTS The interpreters were in full agreement on 574 of 712 (80.6%) evaluations. The common Fleiss'  value of all the radiologists combined was 0.712 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.692-0.769).

Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKK from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKKŨCIRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs.

Finally, onsite coaching and tutoring experiences were formative in developing essential skills for teaching mathematics in elementary school in the following areas: content and pedagogical content knowledge, development of core pedagogical practices, funds of knowledge approaches and collaboration with families, and dispositions toward (teaching) mathematics such as reframing mistakes, emphasis on sense-making, and co-construction of knowledge.","output":"The community mathematics project: Using a parent tutoring program to develop sense-making skills in novice mathematics educators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using an inductive framing analysis of news coverage, we examine how the most popular liberal and conservative news media in the United States and South Korea mobilize different nationalist narratives on China in responding to social, economic, and political upheavals during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic We identify three major areas of political cleavage in both Korean and U S media discourse on nationalist identities vis--vis the construction of the national or racialized Other  This includes (1) imagined solidarity against China as an adversary;(2) political disputes over boundary-making;(3) and the construction of ethnonational belonging and exclusion Our research underscores how intrastate and interstate shifts during periods of crisis can heighten political cleavages along racial and ethnic fault lines and complicate dominant frameworks of civic and ethnic nationalism in both countries [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Sociological Perspectives is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID-19 and the Political Framing of China, Nationalism, and Borders in the U.S. and South Korean News Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic drove the women to domestic tasks overload added by unpaid care activities that must be conciliated with their paid job. Thus, this work aimed to analyze the degree of the Objectives for Sustainable Development (ODS) Goal 5 performance that deals with gender inequality in the European Union (EU) and Latin America & Caribbean (LAC), due to their contrasts in the pandemic combat public policies and the social wealth constraints. METHODS: The study used a qualitative and exploratory methodology. The data were obtained from the European Institute for Gender Equality, UN Women, Comisin Econmica para Amrica Latina y el Caribe, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Social Science Latin-American Conseil. RESULTS: In LAC women work three times more than men per day, considering the domestic tasks and the unpaid care activities, they also account for 72.8% of the health professionals receiving 25% less than men. The primary health assistance increase for women as well as the recording of domestic violence cases. In the EU the majority of health and care workers are also women, 76% and 86%, respectively. There, these women also receive less than men (6.5%), presenting excessive workload and life risk.

This phenomenon is spurred on by numerous websites that explain how to build a self-made device. The correlation between the use of firearms and suicide is known in the literature, but the use of explosive devices and self-harm is little studied. Unfortunately, the risk associated with the manufacture of homemade explosives is poorly known. For this purpose, we describe a rare suicide carried out by a man suffering from depressive disorder with psychotic and delusional features. The forensic investigations at the scene showed that the man had designed a homemade device, and disseminated numerous suicide notes in his home, transcribed in the previous weeks in which he revealed his suicidal motivation. Crime scene investigation showed on the body and on the road in front of the explosion point: multiple fragments of glass (zone 1), a lighter with blood stains (zone 2), and shreds of clothing scattered along the road (zone 3). Autopsy revealed that the cause of death was extensive blunt injury to head and trunk due to barotrauma due to the explosion of a homemade device. The case is compared with data from a systematic review of the forensic literature on suicides involving explosives. The study proposes the analysis of planimetric areas in these crime scene investigations and active surveillance in these subjects.","output":"The forensic analysis of homemade explosive suicides: Case report and systematic review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is the surgical procedure of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax due to its noninvasiveness and convenience. A higher recurrence rate with thoracoscopic bullectomy (TB) than that after traditional thoracotomy (TT) led us to adopt thoracoscopic double-loop ligation (TLL) as our standard procedure in 1998. This study compares the effectiveness and safety of these 3 operative procedures. Methods. Patients who underwent their first surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax at our hospital between January 1994 and December 2010 were included. Patients with a history of surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax, those with special clinical conditions such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis, or those with catamenial, traumatic, or iatrogenic pneumothorax were excluded. Results. A total of 777 males (14-91 years old; 814 pneumothorax sides), and 96 females (16-78 years old; 99 pneumothorax sides) were included in the study. TT was performed in 137 patients (143 sides), TB in 106 patients (112 sides), and TLL in 630 patients (658 sides). The postoperative recurrence rates were 3.5%, 16.1%, and 5.3% in the TT, TB, and TLL groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Mean blood loss and operating time were lowest for TLL. Conclusions.

METHODS: A total of 1260 participants completed the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS), the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), and the 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) via the online questionnaires, and their related experiences with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: The average SRSS score of all participants (25.13  6.41) indicated a mild sleep problem, and the factors that influenced their sleep were the respondent's gender, whether they had patients who died under their care, their history of psychosis and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average GAD-7 score of all participants (12.37  4.89) indicated a moderate anxiety level. The main factors that influenced anxiety were the respondent's gender, years of work, history of psychosis, self-perceived health status, and whether their family members were infected with COVID-19. The average PHQ-9 score of all participants (8.90  5.42) indicated a mild depression level. The primary factors that influenced depression were whether the respondent had nursed/treated severely ill patients in Hubei and whether they had a history of psychosis.

A large amount of data provides empirical evidence that there are overlaps of different types of addictive behaviors in etiology, phenomenology, and in the underlying psychological and biological mechanisms. Our aim was to investigate the co-occurrences of a wide range of substance use and behavioral addictions. Methods The present epidemiological analysis was carried out as part of the Psychological and Genetic Factors of the Addictive Behaviors (PGA) Study, where data were collected from 3,003 adolescents and young adults (42.6% males; mean age 21 years). Addictions to psychoactive substances and behaviors were rigorously assessed. Results Data is provided on lifetime occurrences of the assessed substance uses, their co-occurrences, the prevalence estimates of specific behavioral addictions, and co-occurrences of different substance use and potentially addictive behaviors. Associations were found between (i) smoking and problematic Internet use, exercising, eating disorders, and gambling (ii) alcohol consumption and problematic Internet use, problematic online gaming, gambling, and eating disorders, and (iii) cannabis use and problematic online gaming and gambling. Conclusions The results suggest a large overlap between the occurrence of these addictions and behaviors and underlies the importance of investigating the possible common psychological, genetic and neural pathways. These data further support concepts such as the Reward Deficiency Syndrome and the component model of addictions that propose a common phenomenological and etiological background of different addictive and related behaviors.","output":"Co-occurrences of substance use and other potentially addictive behaviors: Epidemiological results from the Psychological and Genetic Factors of the Addictive Behaviors (PGA) Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CircRNA ACAP2 and miR-532 both promotes the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, which contributes to myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, ACAP2 and miR-532 may interact with each other to participate in MI. Plasma samples from both patients with MI (n = 65) and healthy controls (n = 65) were subjected to RNA extractions and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression of ACAP2, mature miR-532, and premature miR-532. Correlations among them were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Expression of both mature miR-532 and premature miR-532 in cardiomyocytes with ACAP2 overexpression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to study the effects of ACAP2 overexpression on the maturation of miR-532. The role of ACAP2 and miR-532 in regulating the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay. In this study, we found that ACAP2 and mature miR-532 were both upregulated in plasma from patients with MI. ACAP2 and mature miR-532 were inversely correlated, whereas ACAP2 and premature miR-532 were not significantly correlated. In cardiomyocytes, overexpression of ACAP2 increased the expression of mature miR-532, but not premature miR-532. Cell apoptosis analysis showed that ACAP2 and miR-532 overexpression promoted the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia treatment.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study was performed using Persian cohort data, Fasa branch, which included 3660 men and 5262 women. Individuals were divided into five groups for total dietary proteins, plant proteins, and animal proteins using the quintiles, and the odds of incidence for metabolic syndrome and each component was evaluated. RESULTS: A higher intake of total protein was associated with lower odds of having metabolic syndrome (OR: 0.24 95% CI 0.18C0.33, P-trend < 0.001 in men, OR: 0.42 95% CI 0.34C0.51, P-trend < 0.001 in women) and all of its components. men (OR: 0.35 95% CI 0.25C0.48, P-trend < 0.001) and women (OR: 0.41 95% CI 0.33C0.52, P-trend < 0.001) in the highest quintile of plant protein intake had a reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are ubiquitously expressed in cells. Endogenous miRNA may function as an innate response to block pathogen invasion. The miRNA expression profiles of both mice and humans after the ingestion of honeysuckle were obtained. Fifteen overexpressed miRNAs overlapped and were predicted to be capable of targeting three viruses: dengue virus (DENV), enterovirus 71 (EV71) and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, let-7a was examined to be capable of targeting the EV71 RNA genome by reporter assay and Western blotting. Moreover, honeysuckle-induced let-7a suppression of EV71 RNA and protein expression as well as viral replication were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that let-7a targeted EV71 at the predicted sequences using luciferase reporter plasmids as well as two infectious replicons (pMP4-y-5 and pTOPO-4643). The suppression of EV71 replication and viral load was demonstrated in two cell lines by luciferase activity, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, Western blotting and plaque assay. Furthermore, EV71-infected suckling mice fed honeysuckle extract or inoculated with let-7a showed decreased clinical scores and a prolonged survival time accompanied with decreased viral RNA, protein expression and virus titer. The ingestion of honeysuckle attenuates EV71 replication and related pathogenesis partially through the upregulation of let-7a expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our previous report and the current findings imply that both honeysuckle and upregulated let-7a can execute a suppressive function against the replication of DENV and EV71. Taken together, this evidence indicates that honeysuckle can induce the expression of let-7a and that this miRNA as well as 11 other miRNAs have great potential to prevent and suppress EV71 replication.","output":"Honeysuckle Aqueous Extracts Induced let-7a Suppress EV71 Replication and Pathogenesis In Vitro and In Vivo and Is Predicted to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Presenteeism has, in a larger sense, been viewed as a negative behaviour, although a limited body of studies suggests and reports its positive implications in an organizational context.

Subsequently, mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were collected from PF mice and treated with TGF-1 to construct PF cell model, which was treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (TGF-1 + Bach1 siRNA group) and MAP kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 alone (TGF-1 + U0126 group) or in combination (TGF-1 + U0126 + Bach1 siRNA group), then alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA), fibronectin 1 (Fn1), COL1A1, IL-6 expressions and cell viability were detected. RESULTS Lung tissue Bach1 mRNA and protein expressions were upregulated in PF mice compared to control mice. Bach1 knockdown reduced lung fibrosis (displayed by Masson's trichrome staining) and inflammation (displayed by H&E staining), then downregulated serum and BALF expressions of COL1A1 and IL-6 in PF mice. Subsequently, in PF cell model, Bach1 knockdown blocked ERK pathway, but did not affect Smads, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) pathways. Further experiments revealed that Bach1 knockdown repressed cell viability, -SMA, Fn1, IL-6 and COL1A1 expressions in PF cell model, then ERK inhibition by U0126 enhanced these effects. CONCLUSIONS Bach1 is involved in the PF pathogenesis via modulating ERK signaling pathway.","output":"BTB and CNC homology 1 inhibition ameliorates fibrosis and inflammation via blocking ERK pathway in pulmonary fibrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Complement activation may play a pathogenic role in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by contributing to tissue inflammation and microvascular thrombosis. Methods: Serial samples were collected from patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD). Thirty-nine patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 10 patients had no evidence of COVID-19. Plasma C5a and C3a levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We identified elevated levels of plasma C3a and C5a in HD patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls. Serial sampling identified that C5a levels were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease. C3a more closely mirrored both clinical and biochemical disease severity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that activation of complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, leading to endothelial injury and lung damage. C5a may be an earlier biomarker of disease severity than conventional parameters such as C-reactive protein and this warrants further investigation in dedicated biomarker studies. Our data support the testing of complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Temporal changes in complement activation in haemodialysis patients with COVID-19 as a predictor of disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data uploading needs security and privacy in the cloud. But there are some problems like centralized provenance data (PD) collection, storage, lack of security, integrity, and more time consumption. There are methods like Rabin, Knapsack, McEliece, Elagamal, and RivestCShamirCAdleman for the generation of keys but it increases the encryption and decryption time and less security. Therefore, the blockchain and smart contract-based data provenance (BSCDP) Architecture is proposed for providing secure storage in the cloud environment. Initially, the fingerprint biometrics and physically uncloneable functions (PUF) have been used in verification process. The combination of PUF and fingerprint biometrics is used for secure data transmission. To protect privacy and strengthen the security, the fuzzy extractor is employed. Secondly, we use an elliptic-curve key based cyclic shift transposition cryptography algorithm for enhancing the security when sharing the key. Thirdly, we introduce the blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for PD collection, hash computation, and storing with reduced computational overhead (CO). The integrity of data is maintained by using blockchain based secure hashing algorithm-3. By arranging fuzzy based smart contracts (FSC), the data user (DU) tracks their data. FSC is employed for tracking the history of data. The data collected is directly stored in IPFS and the DU gets a hash from IPFS to retrieve the data in the future. Finally, the data verification is done by the provenance auditor. When comparing our proposed BSCDP method with existing methods, the proposed BSCDP method achieves high security in the cloud environment for 2 K users in terms of evidence insertion time (30 ms), verification time (30 ms), response time (40 ms), total change rate (5%), CO (5.8 Kb), encryption (50 ms) and decryption time (52 ms).","output":"A blockchain and smart contract-based data provenance collection and storing in cloud environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Myopia is a common cause of vision loss, and its prevalence is increasing globally. Objective: To evaluate the effects of school-based family health education via WeChat in raising parents' awareness of myopia prevention and behavior and in controlling the development of myopia in children. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-masked cluster randomized clinical trial of children was conducted from October 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, among grade 1 students from 12 primary schools in Guangzhou, China. The 12 primary schools were randomly selected in 2 districts and randomized to the intervention and control groups. All grade 1 students were invited to participate, and 688 students were included in the intervention group and 752 in the control group. Interventions: Weekly health education via the social media platform WeChat was provided to the parents in the intervention group. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data include results of eye examinations of children and questionnaires completed by parents. The primary outcome was the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia. Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error (sphere of +0.5 cylinder) of at least -0.50 diopters (D). The secondary outcomes were the 2-year changes in the axis length and SE refraction, parental awareness, children's screen time, outdoor activities, and learning tools during COVID-19. Results: Among the 1525 children included at baseline (835 boys [54.8%]; mean [SD] age, 6.3 [0.5] years), 1244 competed the final assessment; the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia was 106 of 544 (19.5%) in the intervention group and 171 of 700 (24.4%) in the control group (difference, 4.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-9.5%]; P = .04). The mean myopic shift in SE refraction in the intervention group (-0.82 D) was lower than that in the control group (-0.96 D; difference, -0.14 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06] D; P < .001). No difference in change in axial length was detected (difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.09] mm; P = .70). Conclusions and Relevance: School-based weekly family health education via WeChat resulted in a small decrease in the 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia with a difference in SE of less than 0.25 D not accompanied by any axial length differences.

Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN--enzyme-linked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN--producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8Caa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996Caa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358Caa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 functions as an immunodominant protective epitope that may advance the design of safe and effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines for humans.","output":"Novel Identified HLA-A*0201-Restricted Hantaan Virus Glycoprotein Cytotoxic T-Cell Epitopes Could Effectively Induce Protective Responses in HLA-A2.1/K(b) Transgenic Mice May Associate with the Severity of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four bismuth complexes, (H(2)En)[Bi(2)(cit)(2)(H(2)O)(4/3)](H(2)O)(x) (1), (H(2)En)(3)[Bi(2)(cit)(2)Cl(4)](H(2)O)(x) (2), (HPy)(2)[Bi(2)(cit)(2)(H(2)O)(8/5)](H(2)O)(x) (3) and (H(2)En)[Bi(2)(cit)(2)](H(2)O)(x) (4) [cit = citrate(4?); En = ethylenediamine; Py = pyridine] have been synthesized and crystallized.

Those factors' relevance and their impact on sexual function in this population have not yet been established. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sexual function in healthcare professionals and medical students at a reference center in the treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with online questionnaires about sexual function was sent to health professionals and medical students from the HC-FMUSP medical complex. The questionnaire evaluated Total Sexual and Masturbatory Frequency prior and during the pandemic, libido and sexual satisfaction changes with a detailed inquire about demographics and personal factors. An objective assessment of sexual function was also made using the validated sexual quotient questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in intercourse frequency, libido, and overall sexual satisfaction, in a sample of healthcare professionals particularly vulnerable to the pandemic effects. RESULTS: A total of 1,314 responses were available with a mean age of 37 years. Worsening of sexual satisfaction was reported by 44.5% of the participants, with the following associated factors: Lower libido, missing Nightlife, Higher Masturbatory Frequency, and isolation from the partner. Remaning sexualy actively and having higher sexual frequency appear to decrease the chance of worsening sexual function. Worsening of Libido was reported by 37% and had several associated factors, including missing of Nightlife, older age, isolation from the partner among others. Being male and sexually active was associated with a smaller chance of reporting lower libido. CONCLUSION: We were able to observe a sharp drop in Libido and General Sexual Satisfaction. Although an increase in pornography consumption and masturbatory frequency did occur, these factors were not associated with greater sexual satisfaction. The impact of COVID-19 on this population's sexual health is not to be underestimated and should be further studied in the follow-up of the pandemic.

In this sense, it was emphasized that the accuracy rate of diagnosis (classification) can be improved via deep learning algorithms, by needing no hybrid-complex models, and a secure data processing can be achieved with a multi-authentication and Tangle based approach. In detail, heart sounds were classified with Autoencoder Neural Networks (AEN) and an the IoHT system was built for supporting doctors in real-time. For developing the diagnosis infrastructure by the AEN, PASCAL B-Training and Physiobank-PhysioNet A-Training heart sound datasets were used accordingly.

New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. HYPOTHESIS: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID-19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including glutathione, vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and \\"cytokine storm syndrome\\" with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to \\"acute respiratory distress syndrome\\" (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NF-&#954;B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione with associated anti-viral effects should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID-19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: A three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with ivermectin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NF-&#954;B and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil.

However, it is unclear whether HDACs play roles in complex cognitive function. To address this issue, we examined the role of dorsal striatal HDAC5, a class II HDAC, in reward-guided decision-making and associated neural encoding in rats. We first injected adeno-associated virus to overexpress a nuclear-localized HDAC5 in dorsal striatum (DS). We then recorded neural correlates from dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as rats performed two reward-guided choice tasks, in which we manipulated either the size of or delay to reward. During these tasks, rats first learned which of two options led to the better reward, and then reversed those contingencies in a second block of trials. We found that rats with HDAC5 overexpression in DS responded faster and chose higher value reward more often during the first block of trials, but were less able to reverse those contingencies in the second block of trials. At the neural level, HDAC5 overexpression in DS elevated and reduced the number of cells in DLS that increased firing to stimuli and reward, respectively, and shifted encoding toward cues that predicted more immediate reward. These results suggest that the HDAC5 overexpression in DS contributes to inflexible decision-making, demonstrating a role of histone modifying enzymes in complex cognitive function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important for learning and habit formation. Here, we expanded on these functions and found that overexpression of HDAC5 produced faster and more automatic behavior, and related changes in dorsolateral striatal neural firing in rats performing a value-based decision-making task.

Eleven patients were followed up more than 3 months after discharge. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 66 years in the LT group and 67 years in ST. The mean duration for the formation of segmental plane and the mean number of staples was 22.8 min and 1.8 per surgery, respectively, in the LT group; and 16.2 min and 3.4 per surgery, respectively, in ST. No patient had a prolonged air leak (PAL) of more than 7 days. Minor air leak was identified early in two and was delayed in one. Two-thirds of patients with early minor air leak had low index of prolonged air leak (IPAL) score. There was no air leak in the patients with high IPAL score.

On the contrary, the prevalence in COVID patients of diseases of the adrenal glands has not been reported. Since the visualization of the adrenal glands is almost always available in chest CT performed in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the evaluation of the frequency and characteristics of morphological disorders of the adrenal masses in such patients appears of interest. We carried out a prospective consecutive series of 402 patients (M 222, 55.2%; F 180, 44.8%) with a median age of 76 years (IQR 64C84 years), admitted in the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. One hundred patients had a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of infection on a naso-pharyngeal swab (24.9%). All patients underwent a chest MDCT study including the adrenal region and clinical assessment of co-morbidities. Compared to subjects without confirmed disease, COVID patients had more frequently close contact with other positive subjects (24% vs 4.6%, p <0.001), typical symptoms (68% vs 28.5%, p <0.001), and suggestive chest CT findings (90% vs 31.1%, p <0.001). We found altered adrenal morphology in 100 patients (24.9%): 62 subjects had adrenal hyperplasia, which was unilateral in 42 of them (67.7%) and bilateral in 20 (32.3%), while 38 patients had discrete adrenal nodules, unilateral in 34 of them (89.4%) and bilateral in 4 (10.6%). The median size of adrenal nodules was 16 mm (10C50 mm) with a median density of 10 HU (-41 - 42 HU). In 17 patients with adrenal hyperplasia, a previous CT was available for comparison: in all cases an increase in thickness was evident at admission (from 1 to 15 mm, with a median of 1.95 mm increase). COVID patients had a higher frequency of adrenal nodules (12% vs 8.6%, p=NS). Sixty-three patients (16%) died. They were older (80 vs 74 years, p = 0.001), had a higher frequency of adrenal hyperplasia (25% vs 14%, p = 0.03), more frequent active cancer disease (37% vs 19%, p = 0.003) and COVID (23% vs 13.2%, p = 0.02). In a multivariate model, adrenal hyperplasia is an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 2.52, 1.15C5.55, p=0.02), as well as age (OR 1.04, 1.01C1.07, p=0.005), active oncological disease (OR 3.06, 1.44C6.49, p=0.004), and COVID (OR 2.88, 1.38C6.01, p=0.005). This is the first study reporting the prevalence of morphological alterations of adrenal glands in suspected COVID patients. The frequency of discrete adrenal nodules (9.5%) is in line with the high prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas in elder subjects.

The microRNA miR\\\\133a regulates cellular phenotypes and is reduced in clinical TAA specimens. This study tested the hypothesis that miR\\\\133a modulates aortic fibroblast phenotype, and overexpression by lentivirus attenuates the development of TAA in a murine model. METHODS AND RESULTS: TAA was induced in mice. Copy number of miR\\\\133a was reduced in TAA tissue and linear regression analysis confirmed an inverse correlation between aortic diameter and miR\\\\133a. Analyses of phenotypic markers revealed an mRNA expression profile consistent with myofibroblasts in TAA tissue. Fibroblasts were isolated from the thoracic aortae of mice with/without TAA. When compared with controls, miR\\\\133a was reduced, migration was increased, adhesion was reduced, and the ability to contract a collagen disk was increased. Overexpression/knockdown of miR\\\\133a controlled these phenotypes. After TAA induction in mice, a single tail\\\\vein injection of either miR\\\\133a overexpression or scrambled sequence (control) lentivirus was performed. Overexpression of miR\\\\133a attenuated TAA development. The pro\\\\protein convertase furin was confirmed to be a target of miR\\\\133a by luciferase reporter assay.

Consequently, it has received much attention from academics and the retail industry. The aim of this study is to review, identify, and synthesise the psychological causes of panic buying, which is a relatively new and unexplored area in consumer behaviour research. A systematic review of the related literature is conducted. The review suggests that panic buying is influenced by (1) individuals' perception of the threat of the health crisis and scarcity of products; (2) fear of the unknown, which is caused by negative emotions and uncertainty; (3) coping behaviour, which views panic buying as a venue to relieve anxiety and regain control over the crisis; and (4) social psychological factors, which account for the influence of the social network of an individual. This study contributes to the literature by consolidating the scarce and scattered research on the causes of panic buying, drawing greater theoretical insights into each cause and also offers some implications for health professionals, policy makers, and retailers on implementing appropriate policies and strategies to manage panic buying.

METHODS: We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictively validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity.

University hospitals are also taking on the role of manufacturers of custom-made solutions thanks to 3D printing technology. Case Presentation We present a monocentric observational case study regarding the distributed manufacturing of three groups of products during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic from 14 March to 10 May 2020: personal protective equipment, ventilatory support, and diagnostic and consumable products. Networking during this period has enabled the delivery of a total of 17,276 units of products manufactured using 3D printing technology. The most manufactured product was the face shields and ear savers, while the one that achieved the greatest clinical impact was the mechanical ventilation adapters and swabs. The products were manufactured by individuals in 57.3% of the cases, and our hospital acted as the main delivery node in a hub with 10 other hospitals. The main advantage of this production model is the fast response to stock needs, being able to adapt almost in real time. Conclusions: The role of 3D printing in the hospital environment allows the reconciliation of in-house and distributed manufacturing with traditional production, providing custom-made adaptation of the specifications, as well as maximum efficiency in the working and availability of resources, which is of special importance at critical times for health systems such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Application of 3D printing and distributed manufacturing during the first-wave of COVID-19 pandemic.

However, in a substantial number of patients with a respiratory tract disease, co-infection with various viral pathogens has been confirmed. Although the association between the occurrence of co-infection and substantially higher severity of disease is still unclear, a rapid and proper diagnostics of wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens reveals an accurate picture of the disease and is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and control of infection. In the present study we reported five cases of multiple respiratory infection in hospitalized immunosuppressed patients: two double infections with influenza virus (IV) type A/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and IV type A/coronavirus (CoV) OC43, one infection with four viruses C IV type A/RSV type A and B/CoV OC43, and two cases of mixed infections caused by five viral agents C IV type A and B/RSV type A and B/ parainfluenza type 3 or CoV OC43. Each patient had an underlying chronic disease and received immunosuppressive treatment. Despite a low number of tested specimens, our study shows that the inclusions of multiplex PCR methods for diagnostics of respiratory tract infections and the extension of diagnostic strategies by clinicians to detect viruses other than influenza are very important and make a contribution to identifying the true rate of co-infections and their correlation with the clinical symptoms and severity of disease.","output":"Co-Infections with Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has been presented as politically independent, asserting it is free from industry influence and conflicts of interest so that its decisions may be led by evidence and science.

We suggest that while NICE procedures explicitly incorporate scientific principles and mechanisms, including independent committees and quality assurance, these fail to operate as scientific practices because, for example, decisions may only be challenged through the courts, which regard NICE as a scientific authority. We then examine what the NICE rapid guideline procedure for COVID-19 reveals about the practical reality of claims about the scientific integrity of NICE guidelines. Changes to guideline development processes during the COVID-19 emergency demonstrated how easy it is to undermine the scientific integrity of NICE's decision-making. The cancellation of the guideline programme and the publication of a rapid guideline process specifically to address the COVID-19 pandemic removed scientific checks and balances, including independent committees, stakeholder consultation and quality assurance, demonstrating that the relationship between NICE and the UK government is more complex than a scientific principle truism.

Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms including emotional disturbance. OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study will be to assess the current state of emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Treatment Centers and obstetrics emergency and abortion care, Ethiopia 2020. METHODS: Hospital based comparative cross-section study design was conducted by using self-administered questionnaire survey from June 1st to 30th of 2020 among 133 and 266 frontline medical staffs from obstetric emergency and abortion care clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers respectively. The data were collected after getting written consent from each participant and it entered into the computer using Epi-data version 7, then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done using frequencies & percent. All independent determinants with P-value < 0.05 were used to identify important predictors of emotional responses and perceived stressors. RESULT: A total of 399 frontline medical staffs were included in the study. The mean age of the respondents of those who were working in obstetrics emergency and abortion care clinic was 27.47 (SD, 3.46) years and it was 28.12 (SD, 4.09) years for the other groups.

We analyzed the trend, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 cases of Nepal from 23rd January 2020 to 30th April 2020 to portray the scenario of COVID-19 after the first phase of lockdown. Exponential smoothing state-space and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed to forecast the cases. Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was fit to estimate the basic reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19 in Nepal. There has been increase in the number of cases but the overall growth in COVID-19 was not high. Statistical modelling has shown that COVID-19 cases may continue to increase exponentially in Nepal. The basic reproduction number in Nepal being maintained at low level of 1.08 for the period of 23rd January to 30th April 2020 is an indication of effectiveness of lockdown in containing the COVID-19 spread. The models further suggest that COVID-19 might persist until December 2020 with peak cases in August 2020.

In March 2020, global social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the AR games developer Niantic Inc to implement several changes to ensure continued player engagement with Pokmon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. We sought to examine how the physical and mental well-being of players of these games were affected during the unprecedented COVID-19 restriction period as well as how their video game engagement was affected. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the impact of COVID-19Crelated social restrictions on the physical and mental well-being of AR game players; to examine the impact of COVID-19Crelated social restrictions on the use of video games and motivations for their use; and to explore the potential role of AR games (and video games in general) in supporting well-being during COVID-19Crelated social restrictions. METHODS: A mixed methods web-based self-reported survey was conducted in May 2020, during which COVID-19Crelated social restrictions were enforced in many countries. Participants were recruited on the web via four subreddits dedicated to Pokmon GO or Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. Data collected included quantitative data on demographics, time spent playing video games, physical activity, and mental health; qualitative data included motivations to play and the impact of video games on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: We report results for 2004 participants (1153/1960 male, 58.8%, average age 30.5 years). Self-reported physical activity during COVID-19Crelated social restrictions significantly decreased from 7.50 hours per week on average (SD 11.12) to 6.50 hours (SD 7.81) (P<.001). More than half of the participants reported poor mental health (925/1766, 52.4%; raw World Health OrganizationC5 Well-Being Index score <13). Female gender, younger age, and reduced exercise were significant predictors of poor mental health. Participants reported a significant increase in video game play time from 16.38 hours per week on average (SD 19.12) to 20.82 hours (SD 17.49) (P<.001). Approximately three quarters of the participants (n=1102/1427, 77.2%) reported that playing video games had been beneficial to their mental health. The changes made to Pokmon GO and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite were very well received by players, and the players continued to use these games while exercising and to maintain social connection. In addition to seeking an escape during the pandemic and as a form of entertainment, participants reported that they used video games for emotional coping and to lower stress, relax, and alleviate mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: AR games have the potential to promote physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used by populations under isolation and distress, these games can improve physical and mental health by providing virtual socialization, sustained exercise, temporal routine, and mental structure. Further research is needed to explore the potential of AR games as digital behavioral interventions to maintain human well-being in the wider population.","output":"COVID-19 as Game Changer for the Physical Activity and Mental Well-Being of Augmented Reality Game Players During the Pandemic: Mixed Methods Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adults aged &#8805;65 years are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and were identified as a priority group to receive the first COVID-19 vaccines approved for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States (1-3).

However, increased soluble IgD (sIgD) levels and increased IgD+IgM- B-cell populations have been described in the human upper respiratory mucosa. OBJECTIVE We assessed whether levels of sIgD and IgD+ B cell counts are altered in nasal tissue from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We further characterized IgD+ B-cell populations and explored clinical and local inflammatory factors associated with tissue sIgD levels. METHODS sIgD levels were measured by means of ELISA in nasal tissues, nasal lavage fluid, sera, and supernatants of dissociated nasal tissues. IgD+ cells were identified by using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Inflammatory mediator levels in tissues were assessed by using real-time PCR and multiplex immunoassays. Bacterial cultures from the middle meatus were performed. Underlying medical history and medicine use were obtained from medical records. RESULTS sIgD levels and numbers of IgD+ cells were significantly increased in uncinate tissue (UT) of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) compared with that of control subjects (4-fold, P < .05). IgD+ cells were densely scattered in the periglandular regions of UT from patients with CRSsNP. We also found that IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast numbers were significantly increased in tissues from patients with CRSsNP compared with control tissues (P < .05). Among numerous factors tested, IL-2 levels were increased in UT from patients with CRSsNP and were positively correlated with tissue IgD levels. Additionally, supernatants of IL-2-stimulated dissociated tissue from patients with CRSsNP had significantly increased sIgD levels compared with those in IL-2-stimulated dissociated control tissue ex vivo (P < .05). Tissue from patients with CRS with preoperative antibiotic use or those with pathogenic bacteria showed higher IgD levels compared with tissue from patients without these variables (P < .05). CONCLUSION sIgD levels and IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast counts were increased in nasal tissue of patients with CRSsNP.

AIM The aim of this study was to explore risk factors for in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission for hospitalised COVID-19 patients during the first epidemic wave in Switzerland, as an example of a country that coped well during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS This study included all (n = 3590) adult polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed hospitalised patients in 17 hospitals from the hospital-based surveillance of COVID-19 (CH-Sur) by 1 September 2020. We calculated univariable and multivariable (adjusted) (1) proportional hazards (Fine and Gray) survival regression models and (2) logistic regression models for in-hospital mortality and admission to ICU, to evaluate the most common comorbidities as potential risk factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We found that old age was the strongest factor for in-hospital mortality after having adjusted for gender and the considered comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33?2.59 and HR 5.6 95% CI 5.23?6 for ages 65 and 80 years, respectively). In addition, male gender remained an important risk factor in the multivariable models (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.41?1.53). Of all comorbidities, renal disease, oncological pathologies, chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease (but not hypertension) and dementia were also risk factors for in-hospital mortality. With respect to ICU admission risk, the pattern was different, as patients with higher chances of survival might have been admitted more often to ICU. Male gender (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.58?2.31), hypertension (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.07?1.59) and age 55C79 years (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06?1.26) are risk factors for ICU admission. Patients aged 80+ years, as well as patients with dementia or with liver disease were admitted less often to ICU. CONCLUSION We conclude that increasing age is the most important risk factor for in-hospital mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Switzerland, along with male gender and followed by the presence of comorbidities such as renal diseases, chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease, oncological malignancies and dementia. Male gender, hypertension and age between 55 and 79 years are, however, risk factors for ICU admission. Mortality and ICU admission need to be considered as separate outcomes when investigating risk factors for pandemic control measures and for hospital resources planning.","output":"Risk factors for severe outcomes for COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Switzerland during the first pandemic wave, February to August 2020: prospective observational cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like several countries, the global pandemic, COVID-19, has hit India quite badly In order to stop the spread of the disease, India has imposed a stringent national lockdown It may adopt several other regulatory measures in future This paper examines that if foreign investors bring Investor-State Dispute Settlement (hereinafter \\"ISDS\\") claims against India under different bilateral investment treaties challenging Indian COVID-19 related regulatory measures as indirect expropriation, will India be able to defend its regulatory measures by invoking the police powers doctrine The police powers doctrine is recognised by several ISDS tribunals However, ISDS tribunals differ on the actual scope of this doctrine when assessed in relation to the effect a regulatory measure may have on foreign investment This paper argues that while India can rely on the police powers doctrine, its actual working in a case will depend on arbitral discretion To have a better chance at defending its COVID-19 related regulatory measures as part of State police powers doctrine, India should ensure that exercise of its regulatory measure is not excessive or disproportionate","output":"Covid-19, India and Indirect Expropriation: Is the Police Powers Doctrine a Reliable Defence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) of the family Paramyxoviridae is a relatively new virus causing severe acute respiratory tract infections (SARI) in children.

To explore existing data about post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, this meta-analysis assesses the prevalence of persistent manifestations in multiple systems and abnormalities in lung function, as well as their related risks in patients with various severities. Methods: Articles about discharged COVID-19 patients (published from January 1, 2020 to February 23, 2021) were obtained by searching four databases. Cohort studies with follow-up periods >1 month post-discharge or >2 months post-admission were included. Results: A total of 4,478 COVID-19 patients from 16 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. Fatigue or weakness (47%) were the most prevalent physical effects of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, while psychosocial (28%) symptoms were the most common manifestations among several systems. Abnormalities in lung function of recovering patients, i.e., DLCO <80% (47%, 95% CI: 32C61%) persisted for long periods. Severe patients were more likely to present joint pain (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11C3.04) and decreased lung functions compared with non-severe patients, with pooled ORs for abnormal TLC, FEV1, FVC, and DLCO of 3.05 (95% CI: 1.88C4.96), 2.72 (95% CI: 1.31C5.63), 2.52 (95% CI: 1.28C4.98), and 1.82 (95% CI: 1.32C2.50), respectively.

The current study focuses on ORBIT Phase 2a-proof of concept. We hypothesized that TMI would be acceptable and feasible and would show a signal of efficacy of improving and maintaining community health worker (CHW) MI competence scores using an innovative statistical method for small N proof-of-concept studies. Method: Longitudinal data were collected from 19 CHWs at 16 youth HIV agencies. CHWs from 8 sites were assigned to the TMI group per the cofunders request. The remaining 8 sites were randomly assigned to TMI or services as usual. MI competence was assessed at baseline and up to 15 times over 2 years. Random coefficient models were utilized to examine time trajectories of competence scores and the impact of the intervention on competence trajectories. Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine barriers and facilitators of TMI. Results: Competence scores in the TMI group significantly increased while the scores of the control group significantly decreased. Further analysis of the intervention group demonstrated that scores significantly increased during the first 3 months after initial workshop and was sustained through the end of the study. Qualitative findings revealed insufficient time and competing priorities as perceived barriers whereas integrating MI into routine agency practices and ongoing training might facilitate implementation.

METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study between April and August 2021 among 86 adults COVID-19 survivors in Lecco (Italy). The PTSD was measured using the PTSD-checklist (PCL), HADS scale was used to measure anxiety and depression. Chi-square test or Fisher exact two-tailed tests were used to test for associations and the multiple logistic regressions model to determine factors that were independently associated with the outcome variables. RESULTS The mean PTSD, anxiety and depression scores were (38.6 6.3), (5.1 3.8), (6.9 3.7) respectively. Based on cut-off scores, the prevalence of PTSD (PCL  45), anxiety (HADs score  8) and depression (HADs score  8) were (n = 20, 23.2%) (n = 22, 25.6%) and (n = 38, 44.2%) respectively. COVID-19 survivors who experienced a decreased level of exercise post-ICU discharge were more likely to show symptoms of depression (AOR = 2.57; 95%CI: 1.31-6.85, p = 0.027) and anxiety (AOR = 3.19; 95%CI: 1.29-8.32, p = 0.021) compared to those whose exercise remained the same post-ICU discharge.

Institutional leaders, including clinical care team members and administrators, deployed many different strategies (i.e. adaptations) to manage the influx of patients. While many different strategies were utilized in hospitals across the United States, it is unclear how frontline care teams experienced these strategies and multifaceted changes. As these surge adaptations likely directly impact clinical care teams, we aimed to understand the perceptions and impact of these clinical care and staffing adaptations on hospitalists and care team members in order to optimize future surge plans. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with hospitalist physicians, advanced practice providers (APPs), and hospital nursing and care management staff at a quaternary academic medical center. Interviews focused on the impact of COVID-19 surge practices on the following areas: (1) the experience of clinical care teams with the adaptations used to manage the surge (2) the perception and experience with the communication strategies utilized (3) the personal experience with the adaptations (i.e. how they impacted the individual) and (4) if participants had recommendations on strategies for future surges. We utilized rapid qualitative analysis methods to explore themes and subthemes. RESULTS: We conducted five focus groups and 21 interviews. Three themes emerged from the work including (1) dynamic clinical experience with a lot of uncertainty, (2) the importance of visible leadership with a focus on sense-making, and (3) the significant emotional toll on care team members. Subthemes included sufficient workforce, role delineation and training, information sharing, the unique dichotomy between the need for flexibility and the need for structure, the importance of communication, and the emotional toll not only on the provider but their families.

Reverse genetic studies provide evidence that inhibition of viral enzymes belonging to the capping pathway leads to inhibition of virus replication. The replication defect results from reduced protein synthesis as well as from detection of incompletely capped RNAs by cellular innate immunity sensors. Thus, it is now admitted that capping enzymes are validated antiviral targets, as their inhibition will support an antiviral response in addition to the attenuation of viral mRNA translation.

The model has a trigonometric baseline and considers any upwards deviation from that to come from flu or extreme temperatures.

With the former the model gives the number of deaths because of flu and with the latter the number of deaths because of extreme temperatures.In this article we show that FluMOMO lacks important variables to be an accurate measure of, all causes mortality and flu mortality. Indeed, we found, as expected, that population ageing and exposure to the risk of death cant be excluded from the linear predictor.We also show that FluMOMO assumes independent errors, but errors produced by the model are not independent. To overcome that we model weekly deaths as an autoregressive process (lag of one week), which improved the results. This step also allowed us to finish with FluMOMO trigonometric baseline and have a better fit to weekly deaths through demographic, meteorological and health variables together with lagged number of deaths.The model used data from Portugal between 2009 and 2020, on ISO-week basis. We used Negative Binomial generalized linear models to estimate the weekly number of deaths as an alternative to traditional overdispersion Poisson. As explanatory variables found to be statistically significant, we registered: the number of deaths from previous week, the influenza activity index, the population average age, the heat waves, the flu season, the number of deaths with COVID-19 and the population exposed to the risk of dying.Considering as excess mortality the number of deaths above the best estimate of deaths from our model, we concluded that 2020 excess mortality (net of, COVID-19 deaths, heat wave of July and ageing) is low or inexistent.The model also allows us to have the number of deaths arising from flu and we conclude that FluMOMO is overestimating deaths from flu on 78%. Averages from probability of dying are obtained as well as the probability of dying from flu. The latter is shown to be decreasing over time, probably due to the increase of flu vaccination.

Shenqi compound (SC) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula widely used in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. Although many randomized clinical trials have proved that SC can benefit a lot from diabetes and its complications, the systematic evaluation of the effect of SC on diabetic blood glucose control and inflammatory markers has not yet appeared. The purpose of this study is to provide evidence that the therapeutic effect of SC on diabetes and its multiple system complications is related to its control of blood glucose and inflammatory mediators. METHODS: Three English database and 4 Chinese medical databases will be searched from its inception to May 2020. Then 2 methodological trained researchers will screen the qualified articles by reading the title, abstract, and full texts according to an established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The assessment of risk of bias will be conducted by using the Cochrane collaboration's tool. We will conduct meta-analyses for fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, tumor necrosis factor, C-reactive protein or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and other outcomes. The heterogeneity of data will be evaluated by Cochrane X and I tests. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out. We will conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the stability of the results, funnel plot analysis, and Egger test to evaluate the publication bias, and assessment for the quality of evidence by the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluate system. RESULTS: The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

This review is intended to familiarize academic investigators with the IND governing regulations set forth by the FDA. RECENT FINDINGS: CGT products are extraordinarily complex biologics and, therefore, early-stage evaluation programs must be customized to satisfactorily address their unique developmental challenges. The US FDA continues to foster the development of transformational technology that will facilitate the broad application of safe and effective gene therapy products that have the potential to alleviate many conditions previously out of reach of therapeutic intervention. FDA is committed to working with the scientific community and industry to facilitate the availability of these treatments to patients. SUMMARY: The pathway to meet regulatory compliance during early stage IND programs can be daunting to academic investigators interested in CGT product development that typically dont progress beyond phase 1/2. However, by keeping abreast of current regulatory framework and building upon FDAs supportive infrastructure, an investigator can be well-positioned to advance innovative scientific discoveries towards early stage clinical assessments.","output":"Regulatory Framework for Academic Investigator-Sponsored Investigational New Drug Development of Cell and Gene Therapies in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Mosquitoes vector pathogens that cause burdening diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife worldwide. Spatially and temporally, mosquito diversity varies considerably in response to bio-physical environments. As such, there is a need for mosquito diversity and distribution studies, as well as monitoring programmes, to inform on the risk of associated diseases. This survey assessed mosquito species in three major touristic areas of Botswana that are likely to harbour pathogens across prevailing hosts. The results revealed that all regions surveyed had important mosquito groups (Anopheles, Aedes and Culex) that are threats to public, wildlife and livestock health globally, including the arid Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The findings represent useful species inventories for future surveys and monitoring programmes. ABSTRACT: Vector mosquitoes contribute significantly to the global burden of diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife. As such, the spatial distribution and abundance of mosquito species and their surveillance cannot be ignored. Here, we surveyed mosquito species across major tourism hotspots in semi-arid Botswana, including, for the first time, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Our results reported several mosquito species across seven genera, belonging to Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia, Mimomyia, Coquillettidia and Uranotaenia. These results document a significant species inventory that may inform early warning vector-borne disease control systems and likely help manage the risk of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne infections.","output":"Surveillance Studies Reveal Diverse and Potentially Pathogenic-Incriminated Vector Mosquito Species across Major Botswana Touristic Hotspots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Markedly elevated adverse mental health symptoms were widely observed early in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Unlike the U.S., where cross-sectional data indicate anxiety and depression symptoms have remained elevated, such symptoms reportedly declined in the U.K., according to analysis of repeated measures from a large-scale longitudinal study. However, nearly 40% of U.K. respondents (those who did not complete multiple follow-up surveys) were excluded from analysis, suggesting that survivorship bias might partially explain this discrepancy. We therefore sought to assess survivorship bias among participants in our longitudinal survey study as part of The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. METHODS: Survivorship bias was assessed in 4039 U.S. respondents who completed surveys including the assessment of mental health as part of The COPE Initiative in April 2020 and were invited to complete follow-up surveys. Participants completed validated screening instruments for symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. Survivorship bias was assessed for (1) demographic differences in follow-up survey participation, (2) differences in initial adverse mental health symptom prevalence adjusted for demographic factors and (3) differences in follow-up survey participation based on mental health experiences adjusted for demographic factors. RESULTS: Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had significantly higher prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g. one-survey v. four-survey, anxiety symptoms, adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]: 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.55, p = 0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.75, p = 0.00052). Moreover, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms had significantly higher adjusted odds of not completing follow-up surveys (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.22-2.31, p = 0.0015, aOR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.15-2.12, p = 0.0046, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant survivorship bias among longitudinal survey respondents, indicating that restricting analytic samples to only respondents who provide repeated assessments in longitudinal survey studies could lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends over time. Cross-sectional or planned missing data designs may provide more accurate estimates of population-level adverse mental health symptom prevalence than longitudinal surveys.","output":"Uncovering survivorship bias in longitudinal mental health surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research phenomenologically explored the experience of facilitating virtual video groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research questions addressed relational processes in virtual video groups, including emotional presence, interpersonal communication, and intimacy. Specifically, we asked how facilitators can intervene effectively to promote these processes in the virtual space, within the context of social distancing. Semi-structured group interviews were held with 26 female group facilitators from various professional backgrounds during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel in May 2020. Phenomenological analysis yielded five main themes addressing dialectical tensions that operate simultaneously in the virtual space, both enabling and hindering relational processes in virtual video groups: intimacy and intrusion in the domestic space; sharp transitions from presence to absence; fragmented processing despite abundant information; sterility and clarity in group communication; and the hyper-aware self C being a participant and an observer at the same time. Moving groups into a virtual sphere challenged the traditional role of facilitators, who struggled to create a safe space in an unstable virtual setting where the boundaries between personal and professional lives were reduced. Findings also point to the potential of the domestic space to promote closeness and intimacy and suggest the virtual space requires facilitators to embrace multiplicity as a state of mind when intervening. Facilitators must work with permeable boundaries between inner and outer group spaces, accept discontinuity as a basic property of the virtual, and acknowledge the limitations caused by multiple stimuli.","output":"Lost in the matrix: Dialectical tensions in facilitating virtual video groups during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Depression has been linked to a large and growing economic and societal burden worldwide. In Europe, depression is one of the most frequent mental disorders across all age groups, but particularly in people aged 65 years and over, and higher depressive symptoms have been reported among individuals with chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease). AIM To evaluate the role of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in depression in a sample of older people living in the Mediterranean basin. METHODS Standard procedures were used to determine socio-demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics of the participants, as well as their dietary habits, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Multi-adjusted logistic and linear regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the associations between participants' characteristics and depression. RESULTS Participants classified as having mild or severe depression were less educated and physically active, and more diabetic, and they reported less adherence to the MedDiet. Adherence to the MedDiet was associated with the absence of depression [(OR, 95% CI): 0.65, 0.50-0.85]. In addition, daily tea drinking was also related to the absence of depression [(OR, 95% CI): 0.51, 0.40-0.65].

The virus responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2. It affects its victims respiratory system and causes severe lung inflammation, making it harder for them to breathe. The virus is airborne, and so has a high infection rate. Originated in China last December, the virus has spread across seven continents, affecting the population of over 210 countries, making it one of the fiercest pandemics ever recorded. Despite multiple independent and collaborative attempts to develop a vaccine or a cure, an effective solution is yet to come out. While the disease has put the world in a standstill, detecting the positive subjects and isolating them from the others as soon as possible is the only way to minimize its spread. However, many countries are currently experiencing a massive shortage of diagnostic equipment and medical personals. This insufficiency inspired us to work on a computer-based automatic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we proposed a sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model to detect COVID-19 through analyzing Computed Tomography (CT) scan images.

In our hospital, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was introduced as a result of these reorganizations. A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate whether typical geriatric risk factors, such as frailty, comorbidity, living situation and cognitive decline, have added value compared to conventional risk factors in predicting severe COVID-19 disease and in-hospital death. Methods: : In patients aged 70 years and over, an online geriatric assessment questionnaire was launched, from which the CFS was scored by the geriatrics team. Additional clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. Baseline characteristics were described with descriptive statistics. Associations were analysed with uni- and multivariable analyses. Results: : One hundred and five patients were included, median age 82 years. CFS scores were 1-4 in 43, 5-6 in 45, and 7-9 in 17 patients. Univariable analysis showed age, CFS, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), age-adjusted CCI and cognitive decline associated with in-hospital mortality. Male gender, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, cancer and hypertension were not significantly associated. In multivariable analysis, CFS and cognitive decline were independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presence of respiratory symptoms on admission and male gender were associated with severe disease (univariable analysis). Conclusion: Through action of the geriatrics team at the time of rapid changes in the hospital, the frailty concept was introduced in the COVID-19 hospitalization units.

METHODS: This was a questionnaire-based prospective study of 1237 school children aged 9-14 years enrolled from various private and government schools across Delhi in October-December 2020. These children were being followed-up over the previous 2 years (before pandemic) with details of their lifestyle like near/outdoor/reading activities using a questionnaire as a part of another study. The data during the COVID-19 lockdown was collected by telephonic interview. This was compared to similar information collected from this cohort in the pre-Covid period in 2019 when the students had a regular physical school curriculum. RESULTS: A significant decline was noted in time spent on outdoor activity (from 8.5 hours/week in pre-COVID-19 time to 1.6 hours/week during COVID-19 lockdown; P < 0.001) and doing homework offline (from 15.3 hour/week to 14 hours/week; P < 0.001). A significant increase was noted in screen time spent on digital devices (from 6.2 hours/week to 19.8 hours/week; P<0.001), and watching television (from 12.2 hours/week to 13.4 hours/week; P < 0.001).

STUDY DESIGN: Pediatric clinical research networks from 20 countries and 50 of their affiliated research sites completed two surveys over one month from early May to early June 2020. Networks liaised with their affiliated sites and contributed to the interpretation of results through pan-European group discussions. Based on SARS-CoV-2 first detection dates, countries formed one early and one late detecting cluster. We tested the hypothesis that this clustering influenced clinical research. RESULTS: Research sites were first impacted by the pandemic in mid-March 2020 (03/16 10 days, the same date as lockdown initiation, P = .99). From first impact up until early June, site initiation and feasibility analysis processes were affected for ?50% of the sites.

Docking studies suggest a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the ACE2-binding site. Both ACE2 and heparin can bind independently to spike protein in vitro, and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a scaffold. Electron micrographs of spike protein suggests that heparin enhances the open conformation of the RBD that binds ACE2. On cells, spike protein binding depends on both heparan sulfate and ACE2.

BACKGROUND Improving health equity for Mori, similar to other colonised Indigenous peoples globally, requires urgent attention. Improving the quality of health practitioners' engagement with Indigenous Mori accessing health services is one area that could support improving Mori health equity. While the Fundamentals of Care framework offers a promising relational approach, it lacks consideration of culture, whnau or family, and spirituality, important for Indigenous health and wellbeing. DESIGN AND METHODS A qualitative literature review on Mori models of health and wellbeing yielded nine models to inform a Mori-centred relational model of care. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting literature reviews. RESULTS Four overarching themes were identified that included dimensions of health and wellbeing; whanaungatanga (connectedness); whakawhanaungatanga (building relationships); and socio-political health context (colonisation, urbanisation, racism, and marginalisation). Health and wellbeing for Mori is a holistic and relational concept. Building relationships that include whnau (extended family) is a cultural imperative. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance and relevance of relational approaches to engaging Mori and their whnau accessing health services. It signals the necessary foundations for health practitioners to build trust-based relationships with Mori. Key elements for a Mori-centred model of relational care include whakawhanaungatanga (the process of building relationships) using tikanga (cultural protocols and processes) informed by cultural values of aroha (compassion and empathy), manaakitanga (kindness and hospitality), mauri (binding energy), wairua (importance of spiritual wellbeing). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Culturally-based models of health and wellbeing provide indicators of important cultural values, concepts and practices and processes. These can then inform the development of a Mori-centred relational model of care to address inequity.","output":"Creating an Indigenous Mori-centred model of relational health: A literature review of Mori models of health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms of inflammatory diseases involve the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF, IL-6, and IL-17 which are now therapeutic targets with biotherapies.

Despite this, reliable clinical performance data from large field studies is sparse. METHODS: In a prospective performance evaluation study, RDT from three manufacturers (NADAL?, Panbio&#8482;, MEDsan?, conducted on different samples) were compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 068 oropharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital setting. Viral load was derived from standardised RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values. The data collection period ranged from November 12, 2020 to February 28, 2021. FINDINGS: The sensitivity of RDT compared to RT-qPCR was 4257% (95% CI 3338%-5231%). The specificity was 9968% (95% CI 9948%-9980%). Sensitivity declined with decreasing viral load from 100% in samples with a deduced viral load of &#8805;108 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml to 882% in samples with a viral load lower than 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml. No significant differences in sensitivity or specificity could be observed between samples with and without spike protein variant B.1.1.7. The NPV in the study cohort was 9884%; the PPV in persons with typical COVID-19 symptoms was 9737%, and 2857% in persons without or with atypical symptoms. INTERPRETATION: RDT are a reliable method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons with high viral load. RDT are a valuable addition to RT-qPCR testing, as they reliably detect infectious persons with high viral loads before RT-qPCR results are available.

While these measures are necessary to slow virus transmission, little is known regarding the secondary health consequences of social distancing. The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of injuries secondary to physical child abuse (PCA) at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fisher's exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. RESULTS: Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8-24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %). All injuries were caused by blunt trauma, resulting in scalp/face contusions (63 %), skull fractures (50 %), intracranial hemorrhage (38 %), and long bone fractures (25 %). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at our center during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mice of all ages can be infected by the EDIM virus but overt disease is restricted to animals up to about 12C13 days of age at the time of first exposure. The EDIM virus is worldwide in distribution. Its prevalence is difficult to estimate because serologic tests have not been readily available, and it is not customary to sacrifice animals for the purpose of examining the appearance of their intestinal tract or for electron microscopic visualization of fecal contents.

To examine the immediate response of QVR (sum of caval vein flows) to changes in RAP and pump function, we used a closed-chest, central cannulation, heart bypass porcine preparation (n = 10) with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mean systemic filling pressure was determined by clamping extracorporeal membrane oxygenation tubing with open or closed arteriovenous shunt at euvolemia, volume expansion (9.75 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch), and hypovolemia (bleeding 19.5 ml/kg after volume expansion). The responses of RAP and QVR were studied using variable pump speed at constant airway pressure (PAW) and constant pump speed at variable PAW Within each volume state, the immediate changes in QVR and RAP could be described with a single linear regression, regardless of whether RAP was altered by pump speed or PAW (r2 = 0.586-0.984). RAP was inversely proportional to pump speed from zero to maximum flow (r2 = 0.859-0.999). Changing PAW caused immediate, transient, directionally opposite changes in RAP and QVR (RAP: P  0.002 and QVR: P  0.001), where the initial response was proportional to the change in QVR driving pressure. Changes in PAW generated volume shifts into and out of the right atrium, but their effect on upstream pressure was negligible. Our findings support the concept that RAP acts as backpressure to QVR and that Guyton's model of circulatory equilibrium qualitatively predicts the dynamic response from changing RAP.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Venous return responds immediately to changes in right atrial pressure.

The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of different intravascular access methods applied by nurses wearing biosafety Level-2 suits in simulated paediatric COVID-19 resuscitation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, crossover, single-blinded simulation trial was performed. Nursing staff attending Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support courses accredited by the American Heart Association participated in the study. A total of 65 nurses were recruited and randomly assigned to different study groups. They received standard training on intravascular access methods employing distinct devices. The participants wore biosafety Level-2 suits and performed vascular access with the following intraosseous devices: NIO-P, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi needle; intravenous (IV) access was used as a reference method. Both the order of participants and the access methods were random. Each participant performed intravascular access with each of the four methods tested. The effectiveness of the first attempt to obtain intravascular access and the following time parameters were analysed: the time between grasping the intravascular device out of the original packing until infusion line connection. The ease of the procedure was measured with a visual analogue scale (1 C easy; 10 C difficult). RESULTS: The first attempt success rate of intravascular access by using NIO-P and EZ-IO equalled 100% and was statistically significantly higher than that with the Jamshidi needle (80.0%; p = 0.02) and with the IV method (69.2%; p = 0.005). The time required to connect the infusion line varied and amounted to 33  4 s for NIO-P compared to 37  6.7 s for EZ-IO (p < 0.001), 43  7 s for Jamshidi (p < 0.001), and 98.5  10 s for IV access (p < 0.001).

One reason for this could be the lack of knowledge regarding preventive measures against COVID-19 and the inability of the psychiatric patients to discern misinformation from facts. Patients and Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We applied one questionnaire that evaluated knowledge of prevention measures and information about COVID-19 (comprised of two sections, each with five questions). The first section evaluated knowledge regarding the official WHO prevention measures against COVID-19, and the second consisted of false information about COVID-19 which examined the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19. These questionnaires were applied face-to-face to psychiatric male inpatients from a tertiary psychiatric hospital in Bucharest diagnosed with SMI or severe alcohol disorder (SAUD) and to male controls from the community, matched by age and education. Mean scores of patients and controls were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Results: There were 115 male psychiatric patients in total (65 SMI and 50 SAUD) and 57 controls included after the matching procedure. We found statistically significant lower (P<0.05) scores for psychiatric patients compared to controls regarding the prevention and general knowledge of COVID-19 (P<0.001), the WHO information about prevention measures (P=0.041), and the ability to identify misinformation about COVID-19 (P<0.001). The fact that psychiatric patients have less knowledge about prevention measures against COVID-19 and a reduced capacity to discern misinformation suggests that we need to identify new methods to convey correct information to these patients and also to better equip them to handle misinformation regarding COVID-19.

Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a better clinical trial information retrieval that supports searching by specifying criteria including both eligibility criteria and structured trial information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding. RESULTS: The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information.

Possible side effects of systemic therapy and the lack of clinical data on safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients cause uncertainty regarding the vaccination. Here, we evaluated attitude towards and effects of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with breast or gynecological cancer. The aim was to improve counseling of our patients in clinical routine. Methods: Since March 15th 2021, patients who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines were routinely interviewed about immediate (0-2 days) and late side effects (within two weeks after vaccination). Clinical parameters such as current therapy, time interval between therapy administration and vaccination, and changes in the therapy schedule due to the vaccination were documented. Furthermore, the willingness of non-vaccinated patients to be vaccinated was assessed. The collected data were anonymously analyzed as a part of routine quality assurance. Results: By May 10th 2021, 111 out of 217 (51.1%) interviewed patients had received at least one shot of COVID-19 vaccine and 21 patients both shots. More than half of the vaccinated patients were >55y (60.2%;mean: 60.7y, range 30-92y);69% with UICC/ FIGO stage III/IV cancer. 74.6% received Conmirnaty (BioNTech/ Pfizer), 18.9% Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) and 6.5% Covid-19 Vaccine Moderna. After the first shot, 33.3% of the patients described no side effects, 49.1% reported a local reaction (swelling or pain), 23.4% flu-like symptoms, 10.8% headache and 3.6% nausea. 11 patients had symptoms that lasted longer than two days. In 11 cases, COVID-19 vaccination had an impact on delivery of the systemic therapy (n=10 postponements of therapy and n=1 dose reduction). 61.3% of the non-vaccinated patients (in total n=118) were already registered to get vaccinated;32.8% chose to postpone vaccination for personal reasons;5% refused vaccination. Conclusions: Breast and gynecological cancer patients appear to tolerate COVID-19 vaccination well under systemic therapy and only in few cases the vaccination interfered with the treatment schedule. Updated results will be presented at the ESMO Congress. Legal entity responsible for the study: LMU University Hospital. Funding: Has not received any funding.

The main difference between our publication and that of Zhang et al. (1), was that we assessed all rare predicted loss-of-function variants (pLOFs) meeting the same criteria in cases and controls, which is a well-established paradigm in the field (2). On the other hand, Zhang et al. included specific variants which were experimentally confirmed only in cases, but not controls, precluding a valid case-control comparison.We matched patients as closely as possible to the previous study, and the inclusion of more severe cases (WHO grades 7-10) should only strengthen the signal against population controls. The use of population controls is standard in such settings and has minimal impact on power, because only a small proportion of individuals exposed to SARS-Cov-2 develop severe disease (3). Additionally, for the pLOF model we report adequate power even for an odds ratio of 5.5, which is considerably lower than the one reported by Zhang et al. We tested the same dominant model as Zhang et al., even though LOF variants in these genes have only been reported to cause disease under recessive inheritance (4).We have serious concerns about confounding by ancestry in the analysis by Zhang et al. in which the pLOF carriers were mostly European, but functionally validated missense variants were found in various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Because the rates of pLOFs vary considerably across populations, adjusting for only 3 principal components of ancestry in rare-variant association tests of multi-ethnic cohorts does not provide adequate control for population structure.While we noted that age differences may contribute to the discrepancies between the two studies, Zhang et al. do not discuss the role of age in the interpretation of their results stating: \\"Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity at eight loci were found in as many as 23 patients (3.5%) of various ages (17 to 77 years) and ancestries (various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East) and in patients of both sexes.\\" We also note that the patients with autoantibodies were not excluded from the primary analysis by Zhang et al., but this was done only in the post-hoc analysis.Most importantly, our negative findings are in full agreement with the recently published independent study of 586,157 individuals, including 20,952 cases of COVID-19 (4,928 hospitalized and 1,304 requiring ventilation or resulting in death) (5). There were no significant associations with any of the 13 candidate genes examined either individually or in aggregate, or when comparisons included all hospitalized cases or only the most severe cases. Indeed, none of the associations displayed even marginal significance. Therefore, consistent with our study, these findings do not support substantial contributions of inborn errors in type I IFN immunity to COVID-19 severity.These negative results underscore the importance of proper study design, selection of appropriate genetic models, adequate control for genetic ancestry, and adherence to unbiased methods for genetic discovery rather than focusing only on a candidate biological pathway.","output":"Association of rare predicted loss-of-function variants of influenza-related type I IFN genes with critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHOD: A systematic review of literature published up to March 2021 was conducted to summarize changes in prevalence, incidence, and severity of substance use associated with COVID-19 and the accompanying public health measures, including lockdown, stay-at-home orders, and social distancing. RESULTS: We identified 53 papers describing changes to substance use at the population level. The majority of papers described changes related to alcohol use and most relied on self-reported measures of consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic use. There was less evidence to support changes in non-alcohol substance use. In general, risky pre-pandemic alcohol use, caregiving responsibilities, stress, depression, anxiety, and current treatment for a mental disorder were found to be associated with increased substance use. CONCLUSION: This review provides preliminary data on changes in substance use, indicating that certain segments of the population increased their alcohol use early on in the COVID-19 pandemic and may be at greater risk of harm and in need of additional services.

A computed tomography scan generates images in dicom format that must be converted to jpg or bmp format, so it is necessary to determine which format has better resolution. With the new processed images, matrix of size 145  145, a dataset is formed to train the neural network. When obtaining the neural network model, a reduction in training times between processed and unprocessed images is observed. Likewise, the predictions of the neural network, developed in python, for the detection of COVID-19 with processed images indicate results over 98%. Another important result is that singular value decomposition can be used to determine that images in bmp format provide more detail than images in jpg format, working with 90% of the original information in the image.

Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320;54.6% male;mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.","output":"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature has reported a high percentage of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases in subjects with COVID-19 infection.

This may be particularly true for women who give birth during the crisis, especially those at risk for postnatal depression. Maternal postnatal depression has been identified as a public health issue with profound impacts on maternal and child well-being. Evidence from previous crises (e.g., earthquakes, terrorist attacks) has shown that crises significantly impact maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes. The aims of this paper were therefore to conduct a review to identify the established risk factors for maternal postnatal depression, and generate evidence-based hypotheses about whether the COVID-19 crisis would likely increase or decrease postnatal depression rates based on the identified risk factors. Several databases were searched during May-June 2020 for review papers (i.e., systematic reviews, meta-analyses, qualitative syntheses) using the following keywords: Depression, perinatal, postnatal, postpartum, systematic, review, predictors. Risk factors were extracted in conjunction with indicators for their strength of evidence (i.e., effect sizes, qualitative coding). Risk factors were critically evaluated in relation to their susceptibility to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. It was hypothesized that several health policies that were necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., required restrictions) may be simultaneously impacting a range of these known risk factors and placing a larger number of women at heightened risk for postnatal depression. For instance, factors at a strong risk of being exacerbated include: Perceived low social support; exposure to traumatic events during or prior to pregnancy; significant life events occurring during pregnancy; and high stress associated with care of children.

More recent data suggested that undetectable BCR-ABL1 by digital PCR prior to discontinuation is highly predictive of successful TFR. However, some patients have a successful TFR with no evidence of clinical disease despite persistent detectable BCR-ABL1. Some recent studies have shed some more light on possible mechanisms for this phenomena. Some possible mechanisms include immune mechanism, BCR-ABL1 detected in the lymphoid component only, or stem cell exhaustion. SUMMARY: TFR should be discussed with patients with CML. Patients who achieve a sustained deep molecular response may be eligible to attempt TFR, however, setting expectations that overall only 20% of patients with newly diagnosed CML will achieve a successful TFR.

The Green Flag Award (GFA), which is the UKs national audit tool, is focused on the structure and criteria of green spaces assessment. However, we do not know about the changes that drive our understandings of well-managed green spaces, impacts of the GFA, or changes in other assessment tools. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the changes that drive the development of green space assessment tools, with a focus on the GFA, to deliver a framework for the long-term management of these spaces. Methods: This study employed the Protocol and Reporting result with Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis (PSALSAR) and Develop frameworks, as well as the assessment-focused place-keeping analytical framework. The PSALSAR framework was used to ensure accuracy, systematisation, exhaustiveness, and reproducibility. The assessment-focused place-keeping analytical framework was employed to understand the contribution of green space assessment tools in the long-term management of these spaces. Results: First, well-managed green spaces (GS) were positively associated with quality of life, which is a widely known fact. However, the approach to managing GS in the long term is a key issue. Second, the GFA had great impacts on the ability to manage GS well by providing developed domains and reflecting contemporary GS issues. Third, drivers of GS assessment tools include the persistence and importance of conventional maintenance, emphasis on accessibility by expanding practical boundaries, the inevitability of enhancing community involvement, and diversity of involvement in the judging process. Lastly, assessment-focused, place-keeping analytical frameworks imply that approaches to long-term management should be contextualised based on policy, funding, governance, partnership, and maintenance. Conclusion: Understanding changes that drive GS assessment and its association with GS management should be prioritised.

The scarcity of trained molecular biologists for analyzing PCR results makes data verification a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) was designed to ease verification, by detecting atypical profiles in PCR curves caused by contamination or artifacts. Four classes of simulated real-time RT-PCR curves were generated, namely, positive, early, no, and abnormal amplifications. Machine learning (ML) models were generated and tested using small amounts of data from each class. The best model was used for classifying the big data obtained by the Virology Laboratory of Simon Bolivar University from real-time RT-PCR curves for SARS-CoV-2, and the model was retrained and implemented in a software that correlated patient data with test and AI diagnoses. The best strategy for AI included a binary classification model, which was generated from simulated data, where data analyzed by the first model were classified as either positive or negative and abnormal. To differentiate between negative and abnormal, the data were reevaluated using the second model. In the first model, the data required preanalysis through a combination of prepossessing. The early amplification class was eliminated from the models because the numbers of cases in big data was negligible. ML models can be created from simulated data using minimum available information. During analysis, changes or variations can be incorporated by generating simulated data, avoiding the incorporation of large amounts of experimental data encompassing all possible changes. For diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, this type of AI is critical for optimizing PCR tests because it enables rapid diagnosis and reduces false positives.

It can differentiate between rapidly replicating tachyzoites that cause acute infection and slowly growing bradyzoites in tissue cysts. Treatment options for toxoplasmosis are challenging because current therapies cannot eradicate the latent T. gondii infection that is mainly caused by the bradyzoite forms. Accordingly, recurrence of infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients and congenitally infected patients. Protein kinases have been widely studied in eukaryotic cells, and while little is known about signaling in Toxoplasma infection, it is likely that protein kinases play a key role in parasite proliferation, differentiation, and probably invasion. To identify optimized new kinase inhibitors for drug development against T. gondii, we screened a library of kinase inhibitor compounds for anti-Toxoplasma activity and host cell cytotoxicity. Pyrimethamine served as a positive control and 0.5% DMSO was used as a negative control. Among the 80 compounds screened, 6 compounds demonstrated  80% parasite growth inhibition at concentrations at which 5 compounds did not suppress host cell viability, while 3 kinase inhibitors (Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295 and PD-98059) had suppressive effects individually on parasite growth and host cell invasion, but did not strongly induce bradyzoite formation.

The present cross-national study investigated potential factors that can reduce the burden by COVID-19 in China and Germany. Cross-sectional and longitudinal (China: N = 474, baseline, BL: 2015, follow-up, FU: 2020; Germany: N = 359, BL: 2019, FU: 2020) data on physical activity (e.g., jogging) (BL/FU), positive mental health (PMH) (BL/FU), and burden by COVID-19 (FU) were collected via online surveys. In both countries, physical activity was positively associated with PMH, and both variables were negatively related to burden by COVID-19. Furthermore, PMH mediated the link between physical activity and burden. The mediation model was significant when physical activity and PMH were assessed at the BL, while burden was measured at the FU; and it was also significant when all variables were assessed at the FU. The present findings reveal that physical activity in combination with PMH can reduce the experience of burden by COVID-19. Conscious fostering of physical activity and PMH is supported as an effective strategy to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic outbreak on mental and physical health. Additional benefits such as increased adherence to governmental measures around COVID-19 are discussed.","output":"The Benefits of Physical Activity and Positive Mental Health for Reducing the Burden of COVID-19: Validation from a Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Investigation in China and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This paper reports on the findings of the Nursing and Midwifery Exchange Program, initiated to promote rural and remote nursing and midwifery, and to facilitate clinical skills development and clinical collaboration between health services in Queensland, Australia. The project was undertaken over an 18-month period in one state of Australia, offering structured, temporary exchange of personnel between metropolitan and rural health services. BACKGROUND: Globally, there is an increasing awareness of nursing shortages, and with it, the need to ensure that nurses and midwives are prepared for specialist roles and practice. This is particularly important in rural and remote areas, where there are pre-existing barriers to access to services, and difficulties in attracting suitably qualified, permanent staff. METHODS: A mixed methods approach to the evaluation was undertaken with two cohorts. One cohort was the nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange (n = 24) and the other cohort were managers of the participating health services (n = 10). The nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions related to embeddedness and job satisfaction. The managers participated in a Delphi series of interviews. RESULTS: Those who participated in exchange reporting a higher score on the reported degree of understanding of rural client, which was accompanied with a moderate-to-large effect size estimate (d = 0.61). Nurses/midwives in the exchange group reported higher scores on their perceptions of aspects of their home community that would be lost if they had to leave, which was accompanied with a large effect size (d = 0.83). Overall, NMEP was reported by the participants to be a positive way to improve professional development opportunities for nurses and midwives. The findings also show the program supported practical collaboration and raised the profile of nursing and midwifery in rural areas. CONCLUSION: Exchange programs support clinical and professional development, raising the awareness of different contexts of practice and related skills requirements, and thereby supporting a greater understanding of different nursing roles. In the light of increasingly complex care required by patients with chronic conditions being managed in community-based services, programs such as NMEP provide the opportunity to build collaborative networks between referring and referral centres as well as contribute to the ongoing skills development.","output":"Evaluation of a nursing and midwifery exchange between rural and metropolitan hospitals: A mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Flavivirus diseases such as dengue fever (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika and yellow fever represent a substantial global public health concern. Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. RESULTS: We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI> 25 kg/m(2), prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6C31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3C21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3C18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1C51.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2C29.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5C32.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases.","output":"Prevalence of chronic comorbidities in dengue fever and West Nile virus: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hospitals worldwide have postponed all nonessential surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, but non-COVID-19 patients are still in urgent need of care. Uncertainty about a patient's COVID-19 status risks infecting health care workers and non-COVID-19 inpatients. We evaluated the use of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) screening for COVID-19 on admission for all patients with fractures. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients older than 18 years admitted with low-energy fractures who were tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 at any time during hospitalization. Two periods based on the applied testing protocol were defined. During the first period, patients were only tested because of epidemiological criteria or clinical suspicion based on fever, respiratory symptoms, or radiological findings. In the second period, all patients admitted for fracture treatment were screened by RT-qPCR. RESULTS We identified 15 patients in the first period and 42 in the second. In total, 9 (15.8%) patients without clinical or radiological findings tested positive at any moment. Five (33.3%) patients tested positive postoperatively in the first period and 3 (7.1%) in the second period (P = 0.02). For clinically unsuspected patients, postoperative positive detection went from 3 of 15 (20%) during the first period to 2 of 42 (4.8%) in the second (P = 0.11). Clinical symptoms demonstrated high specificity (92.1%) but poor sensitivity (52.6%) for infection detection. CONCLUSIONS Symptom-based screening for COVID-19 has shown to be specific but not sensitive. Negative clinical symptoms do not rule out infection. Protocols and separated areas are necessary to treat infected patients. RT-qPCR testing on admission helps minimize the risk of nosocomial and occupational infection.

We aim to summarise the performance characteristics of FITs for CRC in symptomatic patients presenting to primary healthcare. DESIGN: We performed a systematic literature review of Medline and EMBASE databases from May 2018 to November 2020. Previous related systematic searches were also adapted to this aim and completed with reference screening. We identified studies performed on adult patients consulting for abdominal symptoms in primary care which reported data such that the FIT diagnostic performance parameters for CRC could be obtained. Bivariate models were used to synthesise available evidence. Meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the causes of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies (69 536 participants) were included (CRC prevalence 0.3%-6.2%). Six studies (n=34 691) assessed FIT as rule in test (threshold of 150 g Hb/g faeces) showing a sensitivity of 64.1% (95% CI 57.8% to 69.9%) and a specificity of 95.0% (95% CI 91.2% to 97.2%). A threshold of 10 g/g (15 studies; n=48 872) resulted in a sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI 81.0% to 91.6%) and a specificity of 84.4% (95% CI 79.4% to 88.3%) for CRC. At a 20 g Hb/g faeces threshold (five studies; n=24 187) less than one additional CRC would be missed per 1000 patients investigated compared with 10 g Hb/g faeces threshold (CRC prevalence 2%).

TPCs are activated by PI(3,5)P2, which is synthesized by PIKfyve. Here, we found that YM201636, a widely used PIKfyve inhibitor, potently inhibits PI(3,5)P2-induced human TPC2 channel Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.16 M. YM201636 also effectively inhibits the currents of a constitutively open TPC2 mutant channel, whereas it exerts no effect when applied in the channels closed state. A YM201636 analog, PI-103, an inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR, also inhibits human TPC2 with an IC50 of 0.64 M. Substitution of the pore-constriction residues Leu690, Leu694 and Tyr312 by Ala reduced the effectiveness of YM201636 and PI-103 in channel inhibition. Interestingly, a His699 residue located near the cytosolic pore entrance is a key determinant for the TPC2 channels sensitivity to YM201636 and PI-103, whose substitution with a Phe in the human TPC1 largely accounts for the channels loss of inhibition by YM201636. Molecular dynamic simulation and docking analysis of YM201636s binding to TPC2 indicated that His699 can interact with the inhibitor and facilitate the channel-blockade at the cytosolic end of the pore. We conclude that YM201636 and PI-103 directly block the TPC2s open-state channel pore at the cytosolic entrance where the His699 is a key determinant for the blockers access to the pore. These findings identify two new potent TPC2 channel blockers, reveal a channel pore entrance blockade mechanism, and provide a new protein target in interpreting the pharmacological effects of these two widely used phosphoinositide kinase inhibitors.","output":"Two-pore channel blockade by phosphoinositide kinase inhibitors YM201636 and PI-103 determined by a histidine residue near pore-entrance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Point-of-care testing (POCT) allows physicians to detect and diagnose diseases at or near the patient site, faster than conventional lab-based testing The importance of POCT is considerably amplified in the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic Numerous point-of-care tests and diagnostic devices are available in the market including, but not limited to, glucose monitoring, pregnancy and infertility testing, infectious disease testing, cholesterol testing and cardiac markers Integrating microfluidics in POCT allows fluid manipulation and detection in a singular device with minimal sample requirements This review presents an overview of two technologies - (a ) Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) and (b ) Nucleic Acid Amplification - upon which a large chunk of microfluidic POCT diagnostics is based, some of their applications, and commercially available products Apart from this, we also delve into other microfluidic-based diagnostics that currently dominate the in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) market, current testing landscape for COVID-19 and prospects of microfluidics in next generation diagnostics","output":"Microfluidic Point-of-Care Testing: Commercial Landscape and Future Directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of autonomic nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in cardiovascular health. However, using HRV to assess physiology status is challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep. Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods. To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL) framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given only $20\\\\%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies.

Our results show that the flexibility of individuals to chose how to integrate information from the neighbourhood increases the vaccine uptake and decreases the epidemic severity if the following conditions are fulfilled. First, the initial fraction of individuals who imitate the neighbourhood majority should be limited, and second, the memory of previous outbreaks should be sufficiently long.

Here, taking SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we explored the antiviral properties and immune-profile of a large panel of four highly stable and well-characterized MXenes - Ti3C2Tx, Ta4C3T x , Mo2Ti2C3T x and Nb4C3T x . To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti3C2T x in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo2Ti2C3T x also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology.

As we still have few therapies and nil vaccines yet available, the void of a clear framework for research and practice is increasingly clear. We describe a framework that has been used to prioritise therapeutic research in previous pandemics which could be used to progress clinical pharmacology and therapeutics research in COVID-19. This is particularly relevant as discussion has already moved on from antiviral therapeutics to delineating the treatment of the host from treatment and elimination of the infective agent. Focussing on the host brings together three concepts: host treatment, the damage response framework and therapeutic repurposing. The integration of these three areas plays to the traditional strength of pharmaceuticals in providing a period of stabilization to permit time for the development of novel antiviral drugs and vaccines. In integrating approaches to repurposing, host treatment and damage response we identified three key properties that a potentially effective repurposed drug must possess by way of a framework. There must be homology, i.e., the same or similar relation with the pathogenesis of the disease, ideally targeted to the conserved pathophysiological outcomes of the viral attack; there must be a defined locus within the spectrum to prevention to severe disease and the framework must draw upon the historical dose and safety experience of the repurposed drug. To illustrate, we have mapped therapeutics that impact upon a key dysregulated pathway in COVID-19 - the renin angiotensin system - using this approach.

These subphenotypes may be important in broader critically ill patient populations with acute respiratory failure regardless of clinical diagnosis. We investigated subphenotyping with latent class analysis in an inclusive population of acute respiratory failure, derived a parsimonious model for subphenotypic predictions based on a small set of variables, and examined associations with clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Single-center, academic medical ICU. PATIENTS: Mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 498 patients with acute respiratory failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome: 143, at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome: 198, congestive heart failure: 37, acute on chronic respiratory failure: 23, airway protection: 61, and multifactorial: 35) in our derivation cohort and measured 10 baseline plasma biomarkers. Latent class analysis considering clinical variables and biomarkers determined that a two-class model offered optimal fit (23% hyperinflammatory subphenotype). Distribution of hyperinflammatory subphenotype varied among acute respiratory failure etiologies (acute respiratory distress syndrome: 31%, at-risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome: 27%, congestive heart failure: 22%, acute on chronic respiratory failure 0%, airway protection: 5%, and multifactorial: 14%). Hyperinflammatory patients had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, fewer ventilator-free days, and higher 30- and 90-day mortality (all p < 0.001). We derived a parsimonious model consisting of angiopoietin-2, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, procalcitonin, and bicarbonate and classified subphenotypes in a validation cohort (n = 139). Hyperinflammatory patients (19%) demonstrated higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers not included in the model (p < 0.01) and worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Host-response subphenotypes are observable in a heterogeneous population with acute respiratory failure and predict clinical outcomes. Simple, biomarker-based models can offer prognostic enrichment in patients with acute respiratory failure. The differential distribution of subphenotypes by specific etiologies of acute respiratory failure indicates that subphenotyping may be more relevant in patients with hypoxemic causes of acute respiratory failure and not in patients intubated for airway protection or acute on chronic decompensation.","output":"Biomarker-Based Classification of Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure Into Inflammatory Subphenotypes: A Single-Center Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread throughout the whole world , data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients. Objectives: A total of 579 adult COVID-19 cases were enrolled in Shanghai from Jan 20 to Apr 15, 2020, in which 95 cases (16.41%) showed non-pneumonia on CT when confirmed. The characteristics of non-pneumonia cases have not been clearly described previously, and this might provide guidance to prevent and treatment of COVID-19. Method: We retrospectively collected the patient clinical dataset including demography, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory test results, diagnostic classification, treatment and clinical outcomes. Results: : The average age of 95 COVID-19 cases was 31.45  12.89 years old and 95.79% of them were less than 60 years old. They had mild clinical symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities. 20 of the 95 cases occurred mild pneumonia during hospitalization, accompanied with lower lymphocyte counts, in which 60% cases were complicated with underlying condition and 15% cases were over 60 years old. All cases were cured. 16 of the 95 cases were local residents with clear epidemiological history and long incubation time, and mainly discovered as fever and respiratory symptoms. Other 79 cases were overseas imported, some had initial symptoms of diarrhea, smell or taste disorders and so on. They were mainly found at port of entry. Conclusions: : Non-pneumonia COVID-19 predominantly occurred among young adults with mild clinical symptoms and possible long incubation time. The patients with underlying condition or at older age more likely developed mild pneumonia after diagnosis.

The 5-year survival rate of patients with IPNB who underwent curative resection is 81%. However, IPNB is known to often recur in other parts of the bile duct. Nevertheless, its mechanism remains poorly understood. Herein, we report the case of a patient with recurrent IPNB, which was considered to be attributed to intraductal dissemination in the common bile duct at 12 months after curative resection. We also made a review of the existing literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital for the evaluation and dilation of an intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) mass. Computed tomography (CT) findings confirmed a mass in the left hepatic duct. Left trisectionectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection with biliary reconstruction, and regional lymph node dissection were performed. Intraoperative examination of the resection margin at the common bile duct and posterior segmental branch of the hepatic duct was negative for the presence of malignant cells. Histologically, the tumor showed intraductal papillary growth of the mucinous epithelium and was diagnosed as non-invasive IPNB. It had a papillary structure with atypical epithelial cells lined up along the neoplastic fibrovascular stalks. Immunohistochemically, this was as a gastric-type lesion. At 12 postoperative months, CT revealed a 1.5-cm mass in the lower remnant common bile duct. We performed subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. The tumor exhibited papillary growth and was microscopically and immunohistochemically similar to the first tumor. At approximately 16 months after the patient's second discharge, CT showed an abdominal mass at the superior mesenteric plexus, which was diagnosed as recurrent IPNB. Chemotherapy is ongoing, and the patient is still alive. In this case, as described in many previous reports, IPNB recurred below the primary lesion in the bile duct. CONCLUSION: Based on our review of previous reports on IPNB recurrence, intraductal dissemination was considered one of the mechanisms underlying recurrence after multicentric development. Considering the high frequency and oncological conversion of recurrence in IPNB, regular follow-up examination is essential to achieve better prognosis in patients with recurrent IPNB.","output":"Recurrent intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct due to intraductal dissemination: a case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus crisis clearly exposed Germanys deficits in the digitalisation of the economy and society.

Each model was treated twice with a primary coiling intervention using ROI-dose-reduced intervention and regular-dose intervention protocols. Eighty images acquired at various intervention stages were shown twice to 2 neurointerventionalists who independently scored imaging qualities (visibility of aneurysm-parent vessel morphology, associated vessels, and/or devices used). Dose-reduction measurements were performed using an ionization chamber. RESULTS A total integral dose reduction of 62% per frame was achieved. The mean scores for regular-dose intervention and ROI dose-reduced intervention images did not differ significantly, suggesting similar image quality. Overall intrarater agreement for all scored criteria was substantial (Kendall  = 0.62887; P < .001). Overall interrater agreement for all criteria was fair ( = 0.2816; 95% CI, 0.2060-0.3571). CONCLUSIONS Substantial dose reduction (62%) with a live peripheral image was achieved without compromising feature visibility during neuroendovascular interventions.","output":"A Patient Dose-Reduction Technique for Neuroendovascular Image-Guided Interventions: Image-Quality Comparison Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Anesthesiologists have a high prevalence of burnout with adverse effects on professionalism and safety. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of an interactive anesthesiology educational program on the wellness of anesthesia providers and their children, as assessed by a modified Professional Fulfillment Index. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Perioperative area. PATIENTS: Thirty clinicians participated in the program. Twenty respondents, representing 67% of participants and each corresponding to a parent and their child or children, completed the post-event survey. INTERVENTIONS: An interactive anesthesiology educational program incorporating children, between the ages of five and eighteen years old, of anesthesia providers was held in the perioperative area. The program was held over four hours and was comprised of four sessions including pediatric anesthesia, neuroanesthesia, airway, and ultrasound stations. MEASUREMENTS: Anesthesia providers and their children were administered a post-event assessment, including a modified Professional Fulfillment Index and satisfaction survey. MAIN RESULTS: All twenty (100%) of respondents indicated it was \\"very true\\" or \\"completely true\\" that their child was happy with the program, and that it was worthwhile and satisfying to both the anesthesia provider and their child. Nineteen (95%) of reporting participants indicated it was \\"very true\\" or \\"completely true\\" that it was meaningful to have the department host such a program and 17 (85%) respondents felt their child now better understands the anesthesia work of the parent. All clinician volunteers indicated it was \\"very true\\" or \\"completely true\\" that they were contributing professionally during the program in ways that they valued most. CONCLUSION: An interactive educational wellness initiative provides an effective and feasible method for increasing professional fulfillment and satisfaction among anesthesia providers while educating our youngest generation of learners.

A mixed methods action research project involving the co-creation of an online shopping club, the Farragut Food Club (FFC), recruited 300 members who registered to shop online using SNAP, and received waivers on delivery minimums and provided technical assistance and centralized food delivery. We conducted a survey (n = 206) and focus groups to understand shopping practices;FFC members collected receipts of groceries over two weeks before and after the pilot to measure foods purchased, stores patronized, and prices. We interviewed FFC members to elicit experiences with the pilot, and estimated cost differences between products purchased in brick and mortar stores and equivalent products online, and transportation time and cost differences. Online shopping represented a small (2.4%) percentage of grocery spending. Unit prices for products purchased on Amazon ($0.28) were significantly higher than for equivalent products purchased in brick and mortar stores ($0.23) (p < 0.001.)

PCB electrodes are attractive candidates for low-cost and sensitive DNA biosensors of relevance in a pandemic such as COVID-19, and facilitate the opportunity to map disease spread in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) through monitoring of environmental samples such as wastewater. The biosensor reported in this work is capable of detecting PCR amplicons through the intercalation of methylene blue (MB) with DNA, which increases the voltammogram peak current at the redox potential of MB. We describe how these changes are likely to result from the adsorption of MB-DNA complex on the electrode surface. The electrodes are reusable, easy to clean, do not undergo any surface modification and represent a cost-effective solution with long shelf-life. We also explore the impact that MB concentration and DNA length have upon our biosensor performance and provide insights useful to other investigators in the field. The sensor reported here is capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene amplicons at concentrations as low as 10pg/ l (approximately 1.7fM) and can detect nucleotides amplified after 10 PCR cycles. Furthermore, using the PCB electrode and approaches described here, SARS-CoV-2 amplicons were detected in simulated wastewater sample, by spiking wastewater collected from a sewage treatment plant in Mumbai, India with SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","output":"Electrochemical sensing of SARS-CoV-2 amplicons with PCB electrodes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether social aspects of the neighborhood environment are associated with early sexual initiation in a California agricultural community of predominantly Latinx adolescents. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study of 599 eighth graders recruited from middle schools in Salinas, California (2015-2019), participants completed five interviews over 2 years. Social environment measures included neighborhood social dynamics (neighborhood disorder, social cohesion, and social network gang exposure); experiences of discrimination; and school connectedness. We estimated associations between baseline social environment and early sexual initiation (<15 years) using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. We compared contraceptive self-efficacy and attitudes by sexual initiation status using ANOVA. RESULTS: Most youth were Latinx (94%) and age 13 (70%) at enrollment; 53% were female and 49% had a parent employed in agriculture. Additionally, 14% reported first vaginal sex before age 15. Neighborhood disorder (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.21), social network gang exposure (RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49-3.33), and experiences of discrimination (RR, 1.67 [1-2 events versus none], 95% CI, 1.09-2.55; RR, 2.33 [3+ events versus none], 95% CI, 1.07-4.64) were associated with early sexual initiation. School connectedness was protective (RR, 0.44, 95% CI, 0.29-0.69). Youth who initiated sex before age 15 had more negative birth control attitudes and expressed lower motivation to use contraceptives.

We identified the kinase Arg/Abl2 as a mediator of endothelial barrier disruption, but the role of Arg in endothelial monolayer regulation and its relevance in vivo remain poorly understood. Here we show that depletion of Arg in endothelial cells results in the activation of both RhoA and Rac1, increased cell spreading and elongation, redistribution of integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesions to the cell periphery, and improved adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We further show that Arg is activated in the endothelium during inflammation, both in murine lungs exposed to barrier-disruptive agents, and in pulmonary microvessels of septic patients. Importantly, Arg-depleted endothelial cells were less sensitive to barrier-disruptive agents. Despite the formation of F-actin stress fibers and myosin light chain phosphorylation, Arg depletion diminished adherens junction disruption and intercellular gap formation, by reducing the disassembly of cell-matrix adhesions and cell retraction. In vivo, genetic deletion of Arg diminished vascular leak in the skin and lungs, in the presence of a normal immune response. Together, our data indicate that Arg is a central and non-redundant regulator of endothelial barrier integrity, which contributes to cell retraction and gap formation by increasing the dynamics of adherens junctions and cell-matrix adhesions in a Rho GTPase-dependent fashion. Therapeutic inhibition of Arg may provide a suitable strategy for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions characterized by vascular leak.

It is possible to assess the well-being of cats in shelters using tools that are based on indicators used to reveal problematic aspects of welfare. This review aims to provide an insight into available methods of assessment of the welfare of cats in shelters with an emphasis on behavioural, physiological and health indicators. ABSTRACT: At any moment, there are millions of cats housed in foster care facilities for abandoned and stray animals for various reasons worldwide. Care, management and regulation among these facilities differ. Moreover, shelters can never substitute the full comfort of a good home for the animal, and the welfare of cats in shelters is a subject of discussion in many respects. Cats are animals sensitive to changes; for most of them, placement in a shelter is a stressful experience because of changes in routine, environment and the presence of other animals. Stress is reflected in changes in behaviour, causes fluctuations in physiological values and disrupts the immune system, which is a predisposition to the development or reactivation of disease. Evaluation of the presence and intensity of negative impacts is possible through the use of evaluation tools based on indicators that help set the environment and management of keeping so as to disrupt the quality of life as little as possible. Although a comprehensive and valid welfare tool that would evaluate animal-based and at the same time resource-based (or management-based) indicators of cats in shelters is not currently available, it is possible to use partial evaluation of individual welfare indicators to assess welfare. This review aims to provide the readers with an insight into current options of assessment of the welfare of cats in shelters with an emphasis on behavioural, physiological and health indicators with an application in both practical and scientific contexts.","output":"Methods of Assessment of the Welfare of Shelter Cats: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTIONThe clinical course of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is heterogeneous, ranging from mild to severe multiorgan failure and death. In this study, we analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of injury to define the sources of tissue injury that contribute to such different trajectories.METHODSWe conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study to enroll patients with COVID-19 and collect plasma samples. Plasma cfDNA was subject to bisulfite sequencing. A library of tissue-specific DNA methylation signatures was used to analyze sequence reads to quantitate cfDNA from different tissue types. We then determined the correlation of tissue-specific cfDNA measures to COVID-19 outcomes. Similar analyses were performed for healthy controls and a comparator group of patients with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza.RESULTSWe found markedly elevated levels and divergent tissue sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 patients compared with patients who had influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus and with healthy controls. The major sources of cfDNA in COVID-19 were hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelium, hepatocytes, adipocytes, kidney, heart, and lung. cfDNA levels positively correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. cfDNA profile at admission identified patients who subsequently required intensive care or died during hospitalization. Furthermore, the increased cfDNA in COVID-19 patients generated excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in renal tubular cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This mtROS production was inhibited by a TLR9-specific antagonist.CONCLUSIONcfDNA maps tissue injury that predicts COVID-19 outcomes and may mechanistically propagate COVID-19-induced tissue injury.FUNDINGIntramural Targeted Anti-COVID-19 grant, NIH.","output":"Cell-free DNA maps COVID-19 tissue injury and risk of death and can cause tissue injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Unavailability or saturation of the intensive care unit may be associated with the fatality of COVID-19. Prioritizing the patients for hospitalization and intensive care may be critical for reducing the fatality of COVID-19. This study aimed to develop and validate a new integer-based scoring system for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, using only the predictors available upon triage. Methods: This is a retrospective study using cohort data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included all admitted patients with COVID-19 between January 19 and June 3, 2020, in South Korea. The primary outcome was patients requiring intensive care defined as actual admission to the intensive care unit;at any time use of an extracorporeal life support device, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressors;death. Patients admitted until March 20 were included for the training dataset to develop the prediction models and externally validated for the patients admitted afterward. Two logistic regression models were developed with different predictors and the predictive performance was compared: one with patient-provided variables and the other with added radiologic and laboratory variables. An integer-based scoring system was developed based on the developed logistic regression model. Results: A total of 5,193 patients were considered, with 4,663 patients included after excluding patients with age under 18 or insufficient data. For the training dataset, 3,238 patients were included. Of the included patients, 444 (9.5%) patients required intensive care. The model developed with only the clinical variables showed an area under the curve of 0.884 for the validation set. The performance did not differ when radiologic and laboratory variables were added. Seven variables were selected for developing an integer-based scoring system: age, sex, initial body temperature, dyspnea, hemoptysis, history of chronic kidney disease, and activities of daily living. The area under the curve of the scoring system was 0.880. Conclusions: An integer-based scoring system was developed for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, with high performance.

METHODS Participants consisted of 247 249 individuals from seven cohorts across six countries (Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) recruited from April 2020 through August 2021. We used multivariable Poisson regression to contrast symptom-prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related distress, and poor sleep quality among individuals with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 at entry to respective cohorts by time (0-16 months) from diagnosis. We also applied generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis to test differences in repeated measures of mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 diagnosis among individuals ever diagnosed with COVID-19 over time. FINDINGS A total of 9979 individuals (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period and presented overall with a higher symptom burden of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-1.36) and poorer sleep quality (1.13, 1.03-1.24) but not with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety or COVID-19 related distress compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. While the prevalence of depression and COVID-19 related distress attenuated with time, the trajectories varied significantly by COVID-19 acute infection severity. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risks of depression and anxiety (PR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91 and 0.77, 0.63-0.94, respectively), while patients bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risks of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.05 and 1.43, 1.26-1.63, respectively) throughout the 16-month study period.

Informal care (IC) costs, and their effects on outcomes, are not known. This study aimed to determine the IC costs for older adults in the last 3 months of life, and their relationships with outcomes, adjusting for care quality. METHODS: Mortality follow-back postal survey. Setting: Palliative care services in England (London), Ireland (Dublin) and the USA (New York, San Francisco). Participants: Informal carers (ICrs) of decedents who had received palliative care. Data: ICrs reported hours and activities, care quality, positive aspects and burdens of caregiving, and completed the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG). Analysis: All costs (formal, informal) were calculated by multiplying reported hours of activities by country-specific costs for that activity. IC costs used country-specific shadow prices, e.g. average hourly wages and unit costs for nursing care. Multivariable logistic regression analysis explored the association of potential explanatory variables, including IC costs and care quality, on three outcomes: positive aspects and burdens of caregiving, and subsequent grief. RESULTS: We received 767 completed surveys, 245 from London, 282 Dublin, 131 New York and 109 San Francisco. Most respondents were women (70%); average age was 60 years. On average, patients received 66C76 h per week from ICrs for being on call, 52C55 h for ICrs being with them, 19C21 h for personal care, 17C21 h for household tasks, 15C18 h for medical procedures and 7C10 h for appointments. Mean (SD) IC costs were as follows: USA $32,468 (28,578), England $36,170 (31,104) and Ireland $43,760 (36,930). IC costs accounted for 58% of total (formal plus informal) costs. Higher IC costs were associated with less grief and more positive perspectives of caregiving. Poor home care was associated with greater caregiver burden. CONCLUSIONS: Costs to informal carers are larger than those to formal care services for people in the last three months of life. If well supported ICrs can play a role in providing care, and this can be done without detriment to them, providing that they are helped. Improving community palliative care and informal carer support should be a focus for future investment.","output":"Associations between informal care costs, care quality, carer rewards, burden and subsequent grief: the international, access, rights and empowerment mortality follow-back study of the last 3 months of life (IARE I study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a major advancement in the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly high-risk patients.

METHODS: The Task Force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved anonymous voting and discussion through webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (1-3, inappropriate; 4-6, uncertain; 7-9, appropriate), and consensus was rated as low (L), moderate (M), or high (H) based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements had to be classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, which were pre-specified prior to voting.

Therefore, this paper investigated (1) whether the effectiveness of iMCS is significantly different among different CNOP disorders and (2) whether other confounding factors can be impacting iMCS results in CNOP. A systematic review and meta-analysis using a linear mixed-model was performed. Twenty-three papers were included, totaling 140 CNOP patients. Heterogeneity of the studies showed to be 55.8%.

A PubMed, Google Scholar, and bibliography review based on the search terms HIV, telemedicine, and telehealth was conducted. Studies included in this analysis were comprised of adult patients living with HIV, receiving care for HIV via telemedicine with reported clinical outcomes or perceptions of using telemedicine in the management of their HIV care. Of the 179 studies identified, 12 met inclusion for this analysis. Only two studies provided data on clinical outcomes of HIV (virologic outcomes), one pre-pandemic and one during COVID-19. The study evaluating viral suppression during COVID-19 demonstrated lower rates of virologic suppression and lower rates of missed appointments when shelter-in-place orders were issued compared to before the start of the pandemic. The remaining studies focused on patient-related outcomes as they related to the usability and adoption of telehealth models. Many practices documented the benefits and limitations of telemedicine based on the rapid switch from traditional in-person clinics. Benefits included retention in care for patients who lived a far distance from clinic, privacy for patients not wanting to be seen attending an HIV clinic, and more flexibility in scheduling appointments. Some limitations included patients access to technology, ability and willingness to use technology, and privacy of patients who are homeless and reside in a shelter where homelessness is 3 times greater in people living with HIV compared to the general population. Healthcare should be tailored to the individual patient by assessing their needs and limitations, particularly with patients who may be at risk for discontinuation of care, particularly in the homeless population. In addition, there are mixed data on factors such as age, sex, and race being limiting factors in willingness to use technology. From the studies reviewed, willingness to engage with technology did not differ by age, sex, or race but did differ by access and willingness to use technology. Greater limitations were access to appropriate devices for telemedicine and digital literacy. Although there have been difficulties with the switch to telemedicine in clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients have reported being satisfied with care and would be interested in continuing once the shelter-in-place order is lifted. Future studies should focus on the provision of HIV care using telemedicine beyond the pandemic and focus on ways to improve the telemedicine experience for the patient.","output":"Telemedicine for HIV Care: Current Status and Future Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seroprevalence studies are crucial both for estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and to provide a measure for the efficiency of the confinement measures.

A number of drugs have been repurposed without any remarkable efficacy. Amidst the crisis, utilising immunomodulators for boosting host immunity to mitigate disease severity and infectivity appears a viable option. In this article, we have explored the contemporary scientific evidence about levamisole for its potential use in COVID 19. Though the primary pharmacological use of the drug is as an anthelminthic, its immunostimulatory action has been shown to increase T-cell function, neutrophilic chemotaxis and immunoglobulin production both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, the drug has been used with limited success in the treatment of herpes and HIV. The potential role of the drug in COVID 19 stems from the fact that the immunostimulant action can initiate a strong immune response and surmount the surreptitious virus, which evades host cell immunity. However, great caution has to be exercised in deciding the dosing schedule because the drug-disease interaction, especially the fatal hyperimmune response, is unknown and unpredictable. Being a widely available drug, enlisted in the WHO List of Essential Medicine, without any major safety issue, the drug is already in clinical trials carrying out worldwide. As the pandemic continues to ravage mankind with unabated intensity, any favourable outcome is eagerly awaited from the ongoing trials with levamisole and other drugs.","output":"Do We have the Evidence to Repurpose Levamisole for Treatment of COVID 19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spermatogenesis of crustaceans includes nuclear deformation and acrosome formation. The mechanism of acrosome formation is one focus of reproductive biology. In this study, Macrobrachium rosenbergii was selected as the research object to explore the mechanism of acrosome formation.

How these acrosomal enzymes are transported to the acrosomal site after synthesis is the key scientific question of this study. The acroframosome (AFS) structure of caridean sperm has been reported. We hypothesized that acrosomal enzymes may be transported along the AFS framework to the acrosome by motor proteins. To study this hypothesis, we obtained the full-length cDNA sequences of Mr-kifc1 and Mr-Acrosin from the testis of M. rosenbergii. The Mr-kifc1 and Mr-Acrosin mRNA expression levels were highest in testis. We detected the distribution of Mr-KIFC1 and its colocalization with Mr-Acrosin during spermatogenesis by immunofluorescence. The colocalization of Mr-KIFC1 and microtubule indicated that Mr-KIFC1 may participate in sperm acrosome formation and nucleus maturation. The colocalization of Mr-KIFC1 and Mr-Acrosin indicated that Mr-KIFC1 may be involved in Acrosin transport during spermiogenesis of M. rosenbergii.

Reports early in the pandemic suggested that mortality in patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO was comparable to non-COVID-19-related ARDS. However, subsequent reports suggested that mortality appeared to be increasing over time. Therefore, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis, to characterise changes in mortality over time and elucidate risk factors for poor outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis (CRD42021271202), searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus databases, from 1 December 2019 to 26 January 2022, for studies reporting on mortality among adults with COVID-19 receiving ECMO. We also captured hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and ECMO, as well as complications of ECMO. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist and evaluated certainty of pooled estimates using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Of 4522 citations, we included 52 studies comprising 18,211 patients in the meta-analysis. The pooled mortality rate among patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMO was 48.8% (95% confidence interval 44.8C52.9%, high certainty). Mortality was higher among studies which enrolled patients later in the pandemic as opposed to earlier (1st half 2020: 41.2%, 2nd half 2020: 46.4%, 1st half 2021: 62.0%, 2nd half 2021: 46.5%, interaction p value = 0.0014). Predictors of increased mortality included age, the time of final patient enrolment from 1 January 2020, and the proportion of patients receiving corticosteroids, and reduced duration of ECMO run. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate for patients receiving ECMO for COVID-19-related ARDS has increased as the pandemic has progressed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial; however, as outcomes for these patients evolve, the decision to initiate ECMO should include the best contextual estimate of mortality at the time of ECMO initiation.

It seems that the most important safety problem about these medications are their cardiac side effects. Although there are data on arrhythmogenic events associated with the use of HCQ alone, such as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, Torsade de pointes (TdP) or bradycardia, there are insufficient data on its combination with moxifloxacin (MOX). Objective: The aim of our study is to analyze the effect of HCQ alone or in combination with the use of MOX on QTc interval, heart rate, and arrhythmic events in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: This is a single center cohort study of non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients hospitalized with clinical signs consistent with pneumonia and at least one positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result. QTc intervals and heart rates in patients whose treatment consisted of HCQ alone or its separate combination with MOX at baseline and post-treatment were calculated and compared. Results: 312 patients were included (median age of 42 [IQR: 31.25-57.75] years, 54.16% male). Patients were divided into two groups based on their in-hospital treatment strategy as follows: HCQ alone (n: 166, 53.20%) or HCQ + MOX (n: 146, 46.79%). As compared to baseline, QTc intervals were significantly increased in all patients after treatment (406.00 [388.00-422.00] ms vs 418.00 [401.00-435.00] ms, p<0.001). When the baseline QTc intervals were evaluated, there was no statistically significant difference between HCQ alone and HCQ + MOX groups (403.00 [384.50-419.00] ms vs. 409.50 [390.00-425.00] ms, p: 0.086). After treatment period, QTc intervals were significantly higher in HCQ + MOX group compared to the group in which patients only used HCQ (413.00 [398.00-430.00] ms vs. 426.50 [405.00-441.00] ms, p<0.001). We found a significant decrease in heart rate in both groups after treatment period. From 79.00 (70.00-88.00) bpm to 70.00 (63.00-79.00) bpm in HCQ alone group (p<0.001) and from 80.00 (70.00-88.00) bpm to 70.50 (63.00-78.75) bpm in HCQ + MOX group (p<0.001). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of heart rates either before or after the treatment. Conclusion: In this cohort study, patients who received HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with MOX was associated with greater changes in QTc. However, none of patients experienced malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death during treatment. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits with close monitoring of QTc if considering treatment with HCQ especially concomitant use with MOX. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the exact implications of these drugs on arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Comparison of hydroxychloroquine plus moxifloxacin versus hydroxychloroquine alone on corrected QT interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seed plants have an essential role in meeting food needs for human survival.

The paper explores this question by presenting evidence from interviews with emergency responders across the world in the midst of the early and uncertain phases of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although reflecting different contexts, we discern two ways in which the notion of community featured in authorities narrations of their efforts to respond to the pandemic. Firstly, we demonstrate how community was deployed as a discursive mechanism that offered a particular framing of the vulnerabilities the pandemic instigated. Departing from accounts that reduce peoples identities to demographic categories, the deployment of community stressed that the pandemics effects should be understood by the different, yet coexistent, vulnerabilities it brought to the surface for people. Such renditions of vulnerability paved the way for styles of governance that prioritised adapting to the pandemics uncertain and indeterminate unfolding in the absence of prepared plans. Secondly, addressing a register of collective social life between individuals and the state, an emphasis on community engendered the decentralised arrangement of emergency governance with which resilience has become synonymous. Here, community proved pivotal in temporarily expanding resources to deal with an emergency whose effects threatened to exceed governments pre-existing capabilities. We substantiate this claim through examining how allusions to community worked to enrol non-state based efforts at response into a broader public security apparatus. Enveloped within the broader politics of emergency resilience, community shaped how the pandemics effects were understood whilst also ensuring adequate provisions for its governance.","output":"People in a pandemic: Rethinking the role of Community in community resilience practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developmental adversities early in life are associated with later psychopathology.

Methods In this prospective study from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020, consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 infection and respiratory symptoms were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: chest CT with contrast medium performed for vascular indications, patients who refused chest CT or hospitalization, and severe CT motion artifact. All patients underwent RT-PCR and chest CT. Diagnostic performance of CT was calculated using RT-PCR as reference. Chest CT features were calculated in a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients. CT features of hospitalized patients and patient in home isolation were compared by using Pearson chi squared test. Results Our study population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57 y 17). Fever was observed in 97/158 (61%), cough in 88/158 (56%), dyspnea in 52/158 (33%), lymphocytopenia in 95/158 (60%), increased C-reactive protein level in 139/158 (88%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase in 128/158 (81%) study participants. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 97% (60/62)[95% IC, 88-99%], 56% (54/96)[95% IC,45-66%] and 72% (114/158)[95% IC 64-78%], respectively. In the subgroup of RT-PCR-positive and CT-positive patients, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were present in 58/58 (100%), multilobe and posterior involvement were both present in 54/58 (93%), bilateral pneumonia in 53/58 (91%), and subsegmental vessel enlargement (> 3 mm) in 52/58 (89%) of study participants. Conclusion The typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in Rome, Italy, was peripherally ground-glass opacities with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (> 3 mm).

Here we use sensors deployed on a taxi fleet to explore the air quality in the road network of Nanjing over the course of a year (October 2019CSeptember 2020). Based on GIS technology, we develop a grid analysis method to obtain 50 m resolution maps of major air pollutants (CO, NO2, and O3). Through hotspot identification analysis, we find three main sources of air pollutants including traffic, industrial emissions, and cooking fumes. We find that CO and NO2 concentrations show a pattern: highways &gt; arterial roads &gt; secondary roads &gt; branch roads &gt; residential streets, reflecting traffic volume. The O3 concentrations in these five road types are in opposite order due to the titration effect of NOx. Combined the mobile measurements and the stationary station data, we diagnose that the contribution of traffic-related emissions to CO and NO2 are 42.6 % and 26.3 %, respectively. Compared to the pre-COVID period, the concentrations of CO and NO2 during the COVID-lockdown period decreased for 44.9 % and 47.1 %, respectively, and the contribution of traffic-related emissions to them both decreased by more than 50 %. With the end of the COVID-lockdown period, traffic emissions and air pollutant concentrations rebounded substantially, indicating that traffic emissions have a crucial impact on the variation of air pollutant levels in urban regions. This research demonstrates the sensing power of mobile monitoring for urban air pollution, which provides detailed information for source attribution, accurate traceability, and potential mitigation strategies at the urban micro-scale.","output":"Mobile monitoring of urban air quality at high spatial resolution by low-cost sensors: impacts of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency departments are facing an unprecedented challenge in dealing with patients who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The massive number of cases evolving to respiratory failure are leading to a rapid depletion of medical resources such as respiratory support equipment, which is more critical in low- and middle-income countries. In this context, any therapeutic and oxygenation support strategy that conserves medical resources should be welcomed. Prone positioning is a well-known ventilatory support strategy to improve oxygenation levels. Self-proning can be used in the management of selected patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, a limitation for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is that they must be performed on finite-sized systems in order to map onto computational resources. To minimize artifacts arising from finite-sized simulation systems, it is common practice for MD simulations to be performed with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). However, in order to calculate specific physical properties, such as mean square displacements to calculate diffusion coefficients, continuous particle trajectories where the atomic movements are continuous and do not jump between cell faces are required. In these cases, modifying atomic coordinates through unwrapping schemes are an essential post-processing tool to remove these jumps. Here, two established trajectory unwrapping schemes are applied to 1us wrapped trajectories for a small water box. The existing schemes can result in spurious diffusion coefficients, long bonds within unwrapped molecules, and inconsistent atomic coordinates when coordinates are rewrapped after unwrapping. We determine that prior unwrapping schemes do not account for changing periodic box dimensions, and introduce an additional correction term to the existing displacement unwrapping scheme by von Bulow et al. to correct for these artifacts. We also demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a hybrid between the existing heuristic and displacement unwrapping schemes. After treatment with this new unwrapping scheme, molecular geometries are correct even after long simulations. In anticipation for longer molecular dynamics trajectories, we develop implementations for this new scheme in multiple PBC handling tools.","output":"A Reversible Unwrapping Algorithm for Constant Pressure Molecular Dynamics Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging viruses including Nipah, Hendra, Lujo, and Junin viruses have enormous potential to spread rapidly. Nipah virus, after emerging as a zoonosis, has also evolved the capacity for human-to-human transmission. Most of the diseases caused by these pathogens are untreatable and require high biocontainment conditions. Universal methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are urgently needed. We have developed a modular antiviral platform strategy that relies on simple bioinformatic and genetic information about each pathogen. Central to this platform is the use of envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to establish multi-cycle replication systems under BSL2 conditions for viral pathogens that normally require BSL3 and BSL4 facilities. We generated monoclonal antibodies against Nipah G by cDNA immunization in rats, and we showed that these antibodies neutralize both Nipah and Hendra live viruses. We then used these effective Henipavirus inhibitors to validate our screening strategy. Our proposed strategy should contribute to the response capability for emerging infectious diseases, providing a way to initiate antiviral development immediately upon identifying novel viruses.","output":"Rapid Screening for Entry Inhibitors of Highly Pathogenic Viruses under Low-Level Biocontainment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Constant search for new drugs with antiviral properties often extends to products of natural origin. Lamiaceae is one of the most important herbal families, well known for various biological and medicinal effects of a variety of aromatic spices, including thyme, mint, oregano, basil, sage, savory, rosemary, self-heal, hyssop, lemon balm and many others. The paper provides a review of antiviral potential of previously mentioned plants which has been demonstrated so far, with special emphasis on anti-HIV properties. Relevant articles were compiled by searching plant names combined with keywords describing antiviral activity. The antiviral effect is direct, with prominent activity against enveloped viral species. Initial stages of the viral life cycle are the most affected, as these plants appear to be targeting mainly viral structures responsible for attachment to target cells. In case of HIV, there is some activity against key enzymes in the viral life cycle. Even in the case of drug resistance, there is an equal susceptibility to applied herbal preparations. Some in vivo experiments suggest that use of Lamiaceae representatives could help in prevention and treatment of some viral diseases. A possible reduction of side effects of diseases and conventional drug therapy are also some aspects worth further investigations.","output":"Potential of selected Lamiaceae plants in anti(retro)viral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On a global scale, the epidemic of the novel coronavirus (NCOV-2019) has become a major issue that is seriously harming human health and impairing the environment's quality. The current study examines the association between air pollution and NCOV-2019 in China, where cases of NCOV-2019 are correlated with deaths in public databases with data on air pollution tracked at multiple locations in different provinces of China. A negative binomial regression (NBR) model was applied to examine the difference between the number of people infected with NCOV-2019 and the number of deaths in China. The findings show that, after population density regulation, there is a positive connection between air pollutants concentration (particularly nitrogen dioxide) and the number of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths. Furthermore, PM2.5 is the key cause of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths in China. The results indicate that a 1% increase in the average of PM2.5 was correlated with an increase of 11.67 % in NCOV-2019 cases and a rise of 18 % in NCOV-2019 deaths. We concluded that a slight rise in air pollution has caused the number of NCOV-2019 cases and deaths to increase dramatically.

A total of 1106 Chinese college students (M(age) = 19.58, SD = 1.61) completed measures of COVID-19 stressors, rumination, emotion regulation strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and poor sleep quality. RESULTS: COVID-19 stressors were positively associated with poor sleep quality ( = .431, p < .001), and rumination partially mediated this association. The mediation effect accounted for 70.93% of the total effect of COVID-19 stressors on poor sleep quality. Moreover, cognitive reappraisal moderated the relation between COVID-19 stressors and rumination, and expressive suppression moderated the association between rumination and poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Rumination could be a mechanism by which COVID-19 stressors are linked with poor sleep quality. Cognitive reappraisal might provide desired benefits to improving sleep quality while expressive suppression may do the opposite.

However, real-life studies on the usefulness of such testing for screening of HCWs are limited. METHODS: Physicians, nurses and hospital attendants currently working at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik were invited to participate in the pilot study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained three times per week for two consecutive weeks and tested with a point-of-care RAT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples were obtained at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks after the last swab was collected to evaluate the serological status. RESULTS: A total of 191 nasopharyngeal swabs from 36 HCWs were obtained. None of the samples tested was positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, whereas two HCWs tested positive on RT-PCR. Of these, one HCW had a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas RT-PCR probably detected a previous but recent infection in the other HCW. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this pilot study, it is unlikely that RAT will reliably detect novel SARS-CoV-2 infections among asymptomatic HCWs despite serial sampling.

TRIM8 has been demonstrated to be a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in inflammation and cancer. In this study, a TRIM8 homolog from grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM8) was cloned, and its effects on fish virus replication were investigated. The full-length EcTRIM8 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 568 amino acids with 92% identity to TRIM8 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Sequence alignment analysis indicated that EcTRIM8 contained conserved RING finger, B-box and coiled-coil domain. Expression patterns analysis showed that EcTRIM8 was predominant in kidney, gill, fin, liver, spleen and brain. After challenging with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosin-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), the EcTRIM8 transcript was significantly increased at the early stage of injection. Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed different distribution patterns of EcTRIM8 in grouper spleen (GS) cells, including punctate fluorescence evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm and bright aggregates. The ectopic expression of EcTRIM8 in vitro significantly inhibited the replication of SGIV and red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), evidenced by the obvious reduction in the severity of cytopathic effect (CPE) and the significant decrease in viral gene transcription and protein synthesis. Moreover, the transcription of the proinflammatory factors and interferon related immune factors were differently regulated by EcTRIM8 during SGIV or RGNNV infection. In addition, overexpression of EcTRIM8 significantly increased the transcription of interferon regulator factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, and enhanced IRF3 or IRF7 induced interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM8 could exert antiviral function through the regulation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon related transcription factors in response to fish viruses.","output":"Fish TRIM8 exerts antiviral roles through regulation of the proinflammatory factors and interferon signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is evidence from two US states that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are at more severe risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research has not explored whether this increased risk is consistent across the US. OBJECTIVE: This study compared COVID-19 case-fatality rates among people with IDD in 11 states and the District of Columbia that are publicly reporting data. METHODS: Cumulative data reported through March 31 - April 13, 2021 were analyzed. Case-fatality rates and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for IDD settings were compared the overall case-fatality rate for the jurisdictions from Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Settings were reported as receiving any services, community or institutional residential services, or living in own/family home. Comparison of case-fatality rates between people with IDD and their respective jurisdiction populations demonstrates that case-fatality rates were consistently higher for people with IDD living in congregate residential settings (fifteen instances) and receiving 24/7 nursing services (two instances). Results were mixed for people with IDD living in their own or a family home (eight instances). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that people with IDD, especially those living in residential settings, are experiencing higher case-fatality rates from COVID-19 than the general population across multiple US jurisdictions. Short-term and long-term public health interventions addressing COVID-19 risks will not be able to properly address the needs of people with IDD until all states begin reporting COVID-19 outcomes for this population.","output":"COVID-19 case-fatality disparities among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities: Evidence from 12 US jurisdictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innerhalb kurzer Zeit hat sich die Coronavirusinfektion COVID-19 zu einer weltweiten Pandemie entwickelt, die auch den Hausarzt vor gro?e Herausforderungen stellt.

Despite the advantages of digital contact tracing, it is not widely used in the western world, including the US and Europe, due to strict privacy regulations and patient rights. We categorized the current approaches for contact tracing, namely: mobile service-provider-application, mobile network operators call detail, citizen-application, and IoT-based. Current measures for infection control and tracing do not include animals and moving objects like cars despite evidence that these moving objects can be infection carriers. In this article, we designed and presented a novel privacy anonymous IoT model. We presented an RFID proof-of-concept for this model. Our model leverages blockchains trust-oriented decentralization for on-chain data logging and retrieval. Our model solution will allow moving objects to receive or send notifications when they are close to a flagged, probable, or confirmed diseased case, or flagged place or object. We implemented and presented three prototype blockchain smart contracts for our model. We then simulated contract deployments and execution of functions. We presented the cost differentials. Our simulation results show less than one-second deployment and call time for smart contracts, though, in real life, it can be up to 25 seconds on Ethereum public blockchain. Our simulation results also show that it costs an average of $1.95 to deploy our prototype smart contracts, and an average of $0.34 to call our functions. Our model will make it easy to identify clusters of infection contacts and help deliver a notification for mass isolation while preserving individual privacy. Furthermore, it can be used to understand better human connectivity, model similar other infection spread network, and develop public policies to control the spread of COVID-19 while preparing for future epidemics.","output":"Anonymity Preserving IoT-Based COVID-19 and Other Infectious Disease Contact Tracing Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Trauma is a significant public health issue, negatively impacting a range of health outcomes. Providers and administrators in public mental health systems recognize the widespread experience of trauma, as well as their limited ability to address trauma within their communities. In response, the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health funded nine regionally based community partnerships to build capacity to address trauma. We describe partnership and community capacity-building efforts and examine community impact, defined as successful linkages to resources and changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members. METHODS: We conceptualized community capacity-building as dissemination of trauma-informed education and training, community outreach and engagement, and linkage of community members to resources. We measured trauma-informed trainings among partnership members (N = 332) using the Trauma-Informed Organizational Toolkit. Outreach, engagement and linkages were documented using Event and Linkage Trackers. We examined changes in the type of successful linkage after the issuance of statewide mandatory restrictions in response to COVID-19. We examined changes in stress tolerance capacities among community members (N = 699) who were engaged in ongoing partnership activities using the 10-item Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale; the 28-item Coping Orientation to Problems; and the pictorial Inclusion of Community in Self Scale. RESULTS: Training and education opportunities were widespread: 66% of members reported opportunities for training in 13 or more trauma-informed practices. Partnerships conducted over 7800 community capacity-building events with over 250,000 attendees. Nearly 14,000 successful linkages were made for a wide range of resources, with consistent linkage success prior to (85%) and during (87%) the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, linkage type significantly shifted from basic services and health care to food distribution (p < .01). Small but significant improvements occurred in coping through emotional and instrumental support; and sense of community connectedness (p < .05 each). CONCLUSIONS: Community-based partnerships demonstrated effective capacity-building strategies. Despite the pandemic, community members did not report reduced stress tolerance, instead demonstrating gains in external help-seeking (use of emotional and instrumental supports) and perception of community connectedness. Future work will use qualitative methods to examine the impact of community capacity-building and the sustainability of this approach for addressing the impact of trauma within communities.","output":"Developing trauma resilient communities through community capacity-building"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic lung diseases (CLDs) represent a set of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of proper lung function. Among severe CLDs, the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has grown over the last decades, mainly in the elderly population. Several studies have highlighted an increased expression of senescence-related markers in the resident progenitor cells in COPD and IPF, possibly undermining epithelial integrity and contributing to the progression and the aggravation of both diseases. Recently, the chronic activation of the canonical Wnt/-catenin pathway was shown to induce cellular senescence. Here, we investigated the localization and the expression of leucin-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), a protein that activates and potentiates the canonical Wnt signalling. Through immunohistochemical analyses, we identified a lesion-associated rise in LGR6 levels in abnormal lung epithelial progenitors in COPD and IPF when compared to histologically normal tissues. Moreover, in areas of aberrant regeneration, chronic damage and fibrosis, LGR6-expressing epithelial progenitors displayed a major increase in the expression of senescence-associated markers. Our study suggests the involvement of LGR6 in the chronic activation of the Wnt/-catenin pathway, mediating the impairment and exhaustion of epithelial progenitors in COPD and IPF.","output":"Increased LGR6 Expression Sustains Long-Term Wnt Activation and Acquisition of Senescence in Epithelial Progenitors in Chronic Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was aimed to determine the fear of COVID-19 and related factors in patients.

There has also been an exceedingly fast accumulation of new information on this novel virus. As the traditional peer-review process takes time, there is currently a significant gap between the ability to generate new data and the ability to critically evaluate it. This problem of an excess of mixed-quality data, or infodemic, is echoing throughout the scientific community. APPROACH The authors aimed to help their colleagues at the Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, manage the COVID-19 infodemic with a methodologic solution: establishing an in-house mechanism for continuous literature review and knowledge distribution (March-April 2020). Their methodology included the following building blocks: a dedicated literature review team, artificial intelligence-based research algorithms, brief written updates in a graphical format, large-scale webinars and online meetings, and a feedback loop. OUTCOMES During the first month (April 2020), the project produced 21 graphical updates. After consideration of feedback from colleagues and final editing, 13 graphical updates were uploaded to the center's website; of these, 31% addressed the clinical presentation of the disease and 38% referred to specific treatments. This methodology as well as the graphical updates it generated were adopted by the Israeli Ministry of Health and distributed in a hospital preparation kit. NEXT STEPS The authors believe they have established a novel methodology that can assist in the battle against COVID-19 by making high-quality scientific data more accessible to clinicians. In the future, they expect this methodology to create a favorable uniform standard for evidence-guided health care during infodemics. Further evolution of the methodology may include evaluation of its long-term sustainability and impact on the day-to-day clinical practice and self-confidence of clinicians who treat COVID-19 patients.","output":"Literature Review and Knowledge Distribution During an Outbreak: A Methodology for Managing Infodemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients. It is unknown, however, how these levels compare to those observed in critically ill patients with ARDS or sepsis due to other causes. Objectives: To directly compare plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, with a focus on 6 cytokines associated with cytokine storm (IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF), between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and banked plasma samples from ARDS and sepsis patients from prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: 15 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 9 of whom were critically ill, were compared to 28 critically ill patients with ARDS or sepsis. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline levels of IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF between patients with severe COVID-19 and critically ill controls with ARDS or sepsis. Conclusions: Levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and TNF were not higher in critically ill COVID-19 patients than in critically ill patients admitted with ARDS or sepsis due to other causes in this small cohort.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor. On a pathophysiological basis, both ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C polymorphism lead to an enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis, thereby possibly contributing to circulatory disturbances. A mutually facilitatory effect may be presumed between the two polymorphisms. We examined whether this synergistic effect is involved in the evolution of different types of ischemic stroke. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. The ACE D allele combined with the AT1R 1166C allele did not yield a risk of ischemic stroke. However, the co-occurrence of the homozygous ACE D/D and at least one AT1R 1166C allele was more frequent in the ischemic stroke group than in the control group (22.4 vs 11%, p<0.005, OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.46C3.7). After specific subgroup analysis, this synergistic association was even stronger for small-vessel ischemic stroke (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.9C6.24; p<0.0005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data confirmed this association (adjusted OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.88C7.16; p<0.0005). Our results demonstrate that ACE D/D and AT1R 1166C polymorphism were associated with the development of small-vessel ischemic stroke through a mutually facilitatory interplay between them.

This study uses the hybrid feature convolution neural network to establish the blood pressure model instead of the traditional method of pulse waves. METHODS: The pulse waves of 100 patients were collected, and the pulse wave was decomposed into three bell wave compound forms to obtain the accurate pulse wave propagation time. Then, the mixed feature convolution neural network model ABP-net was proposed, which combined the pulse wave propagation time characteristics with the pulse wave waveform characteristics automatically extracted by one-dimensional convolution to predict the arterial blood pressure. Finally, according to the prediction results, 20 patients were treated before the high blood pressure appeared (model group), and another 20 patients with a daily fixed treatment scheme were selected as the control group. RESULTS: In 80 training sets, compared with linear regression and the random forest method, the hybrid feature convolution neural network has higher accuracy in predicting blood pressure. In 20 test sets, the blood pressure error was eliminated within 5 mmHg. The total effective rate in the model group and the control group was 95.0% and 85.0%, respectively (P = 0.035). After treatment, the scores of self-care ability of daily life and limb motor function in the model group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

The TFA consists of seven component constructs (affective attitude, burden, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy) that can help to identify characteristics of interventions that may be improved. The aim of this study was to develop a generic TFA questionnaire that can be adapted to assess acceptability of any healthcare intervention. METHODS: Two intervention-specific acceptability questionnaires based on the TFA were developed using a 5-step pre-validation method for developing patient-reported outcome instruments: 1) item generation; 2) item de-duplication; 3) item reduction and creation; 4) assessment of discriminant content validity against a pre-specified framework (TFA); 5) feedback from key stakeholders. Next, a generic TFA-based questionnaire was developed and applied to assess prospective and retrospective acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. A think-aloud method was employed with two samples: 10 participants who self-reported intention to have the COVID-19 vaccine, and 10 participants who self-reported receiving a first dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: 1) The item pool contained 138 items, identified from primary papers included in an overview of reviews. 2) There were no duplicate items. 3) 107 items were discarded; 35 new items were created to maximise coverage of the seven TFA constructs. 4) 33 items met criteria for discriminant content validity and were reduced to two intervention-specific acceptability questionnaires, each with eight items. 5) Feedback from key stakeholders resulted in refinement of item wording, which was then adapted to develop a generic TFA-based questionnaire. For prospective and retrospective versions of the questionnaire, no participants identified problems with understanding and answering items reflecting four TFA constructs: affective attitude, burden, perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs. Some participants encountered problems with items reflecting three constructs: ethicality, intervention coherence, self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: A generic questionnaire for assessing intervention acceptability from the perspectives of intervention recipients was developed using methods for creating participant-reported outcome measures, informed by theory, previous research, and stakeholder input.

Then, classical MD simulation was performed (IVM/NLS-Major site and IVM/NLS-Minor site), to predict its comparative stability dynamics and probable inhibitory mechanism. The stability dynamics and biophysical analysis of both sites highlighted the stable binding of IVM within NLS-Minor site by establishing and maintaining more hydrophobic contacts with crucial residues, required for IMP-&#945;1 inhibition which were not observed in NLS-major site.

Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1  0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population.

RESULTS: At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs.

Case series have reported that people with obesity experience more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have tended to gain weight because of environmental factors imposed by quarantine policies, such as decreased physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food. Mechanisms have been postulated to explain the association between COVID-19 and obesity. COVID-19 aggravates inflammation and hypoxia in people with obesity, which can lead to severe illness and the need for intensive care. The immune system is compromised in people with obesity and COVID-19 affects the immune system, which can lead to complications. Interleukin-6 and other cytokines play an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying risk factors may all predispose to complications of obesity such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The common medications used to treat people with obesity, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, statins, and antiplatelets agents, should be continued because these agents have anti-inflammatory properties and play protective roles against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

In contrast, recurrent corneal calcareous degeneration and perforation is rare. A 46-year-old woman developed chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia. Severe KCS with corneal melting and calcium deposits were noted in the left eye. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed because of corneal perforation, but poor re-epithelialization and calcium deposition recurred. Lamellar keratectomy and amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) were performed, but acute calcareous degeneration developed with subsequent recurrence of corneal perforation. After regraft, AMT and tarsorrhaphy, the corneal graft remained clear for 3 months. However, breakdown of the corneal epithelium occurred 3 weeks after spontaneous separation of tarsorrhaphy. Six months later, corneal perforation recurred again along with exacerbation of GVHD. Regraft was performed, but the patient refused tarsorrhaphy and AMT. Poor re-epithelialization persisted after regraft. Corneal melting with impending corneal perforation ensued. Further corneal surgery was refused and the patient chose to undergo evisceration. This case demonstrates that the ocular complications of GVHD may be severe enough to lead to corneal perforation and calcareous degeneration that is recalcitrant to medical and surgical treatment.","output":"Recurrent Corneal Perforation and Acute Calcareous Corneal Degeneration in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 was a terrible year for Asia but for some countries less than for others.

New OM episodes are usually coincident with a viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI), but there are conflicting data regarding the association between specific viruses and OM. DESIGN Longitudinal (October-March), prospective follow-up of children for coldlike illness (CLI) by diary, middle ear status by pneumatic otoscopy, and vURTI by PCR. SETTING Academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS A total of 102 families with at least 2 children aged between 1 and 5 years (213 children; mean [SD] age, 3.7 [1.5] years; 110 male; and 176 white) were recruited from the local communities at 2 study sites by advertisement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES New OM and CLI episodes and nasopharyngeal virus detections. RESULTS A total of 176 children (81%) had isolated PCR detection of at least 1 virus. The OM coincidence rates were 62 of 144 (44%) for rhinovirus, 15 of 27 (56%) for respiratory syncytial virus, 8 of 11 (73%) and 1 of 5 (20%) for influenza A and B, respectively, 6 of 12 (50%) for adenovirus, 7 of 18 (39%) for coronavirus, and 4 of 11 (36%) for parainfluenza virus detections (P = .37). For rhinovirus, new OM occurred in 50% of children with and 32% without a concurrent CLI (P = .15), and OM risk was predicted by OM and breastfeeding histories and by daily environment outside the home. CONCLUSIONS New OM was associated with nasopharyngeal detection of all assayed viruses irrespective of the presence or absence of a concurrent CLI. Differences among viruses were noted, but statistical significance was not achieved, possibly because of the low power associated with the small number of nonrhinovirus detections.","output":"Rate of concurrent otitis media in upper respiratory tract infections with specific viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased sedentary behavior has been an unintended consequence of social and physical distancing restrictions needed to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure <= 1.5 METs while in a sitting, reclining, or lying posture. These restrictions negatively affect peoples' cardiometabolic and mental health and disproportionately affect certain sectors of the population, including racial/ethnic minorities. In part, the higher risk for complications of COVID-19 could be the result of an increased prevalence of comorbid diseases. Further, regular participation and adherence to current physical activity guidelines, defined as at least 150 min.wk(-1) of moderate-intensity physical activity or muscle strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week, is challenging for many and may be especially difficult to achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic. A practical strategy to promote health and well-being during COVID-19 is reducing sedentary behavior. Reducing sedentary behaviors (e.g., breaking up periods of prolonged sitting with light-intensity physical activity) may be more easily achieved than physical activity for all individuals, including individuals of racial/ethnic decent, as it does not require purchasing equipment nor require compromising the physical restrictions necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19.

We investigated whether the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation by COVID-19 infection could inhibit mitochondrial function and cause cellular damage in leukocytes. We evaluated levels of oxidative/inflammation markers and their correlation with mitochondrial function and leukocyte cell death in COVID-19 patients at two moments: viremia and severe sepsis with multi-organ failure. COVID-19 induces increased oxidative stress and inflammation markers that activate cellular damage processes. In the viremia stage, an increase in peroxide, nitric oxide, carbonylated proteins, and IL-6 was observed, which was correlated with a marked inhibition of mitochondrial function, decreased cell viability, early apoptosis, necrosis, and leukocytes-reactivity. The severe sepsis stage with multi-organ failure also showed a further increase in levels of peroxide, carbonylated proteins, and IL-6, with a slight decrease in nitric oxide. This oxidative process and inflammation were correlated with less inhibition of mitochondrial function, decreased cell viability and an increase in late apoptosis, and morphology changes evidencing damage in the leukocytes. SARS-CoV-2 induced damage promotes levels of oxidative stress and inflammation markers and mitochondrial dysfunction that potentiate morphological changes and cell death in leukocytes. These processes explain the rapid changes in the immune system, and that present an initial over-activation and early massive death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, promoting endothelial-alveolar damage that would cause multi-organ failure, sustained by oxidative stress and inflammation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death by oxidative stress/inflammation in leukocytes of COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abnormal sialylation of glycoprotein is associated with different kinds of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

In this paper, we propose Tangent Weighted Decision Tree Forest (TWDForest), which is more accurate and diverse than random forest. The strength of this technique is that it uses a more accurate and uniform tangent weighting function to create a weighted decision tree forest. It also improves performance by taking opinions from previous trees to best fit the successor tree and avoids the toggling of the root node. Due to this novel approach, the decision trees from the forest are more accurate and diverse as compared to other decision forest algorithms. Experiments of this novel method are performed on 15 well known, publicly available UCI machine learning repository datasets of various sizes. The results of the TWDForest method demonstrate that the entire forest and decision trees produced in TWDForest have high prediction accuracy of 1C7% more than existing methods.

However, a rapid recrudescence of COVID-19 was observed in the state of Victoria in June, 2020. We aim to describe the genomic findings that located the source of this second wave and show the role of genomic epidemiology in the successful elimination of COVID-19 for a second time in Australia. METHODS: In this observational, genomic epidemiological study, we did genomic sequencing of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Victoria, Australia between Jan 25, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021. We did phylogenetic analyses, genomic cluster discovery, and integrated results with epidemiological data (detailed information on demographics, risk factors, and exposure) collected via interview by the Victorian Government Department of Health. Genomic transmission networks were used to group multiple genomic clusters when epidemiological and genomic data suggested they arose from a single importation event and diversified within Victoria. To identify transmission of emergent lineages between Victoria and other states or territories in Australia, all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences uploaded before Feb 11, 2021, were obtained from the national sequence sharing programme AusTrakka, and epidemiological data were obtained from the submitting laboratories. We did phylodynamic analyses to estimate the growth rate, doubling time, and number of days from the first local infection to the collection of the first sequenced genome for the dominant local cluster, and compared our growth estimates to previously published estimates from a similar growth phase of lineage B.1.1.7 (also known as the Alpha variant) in the UK. FINDINGS: Between Jan 25, 2020, and Jan 31, 2021, there were 20 451 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia, of which 15 431 were submitted for sequencing, and 11 711 met all quality control metrics and were included in our analysis. We identified 595 genomic clusters, with a median of five cases per cluster (IQR 2C11). Overall, samples from 11 503 (982%) of 11 711 cases clustered with another sample in Victoria, either within a genomic cluster or transmission network. Genomic analysis revealed that 10 426 cases, including 10 416 (984%) of 10 584 locally acquired cases, diagnosed during the second wave (between June and October, 2020) were derived from a single incursion from hotel quarantine, with the outbreak lineage (transmission network G, lineage D.2) rapidly detected in other Australian states and territories. Phylodynamic analyses indicated that the epidemic growth rate of the outbreak lineage in Victoria during the initial growth phase (samples collected between June 4 and July 9, 2020; 474 putative transmission events, per branch, per year [1/years; 95% credible interval 260C850]), was similar to that of other reported variants, such as B.1.1.7 in the UK (mean approximately 715 1/years). Strict interventions were implemented, and the outbreak lineage has not been detected in Australia since Oct 29, 2020. Subsequent cases represented independent international or interstate introductions, with limited local spread. INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights how rapid escalation of clonal outbreaks can occur from a single incursion. However, strict quarantine measures and decisive public health responses to emergent cases are effective, even with high epidemic growth rates. Real-time genomic surveillance can alter the way in which public health agencies view and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks.

Currently, the use of standardized PRO data collection systems in US community pharmacies is limited. Thus, we are conducting a two-phase evaluation of the spread and scale of PatientToc? to US Midwestern community pharmacies. This report focuses on the first phase of the evaluation. The objective of this phase was to prepare for implementation of PatientToc? in community pharmacies by conducting a pre-implementation developmental formative evaluation to (1) identify potential barriers, facilitators, and actionable recommendations to PatientToc? implementation and (2) create a draft implementation toolkit. METHODS: Data collection consisted of demographics, observations, audio-recorded contextual inquiries, and semi-structured interviews with staff (e.g., primary care providers, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians) and patients during 1-day site visits to a purposive sample of (1) primary care practices currently using PatientToc? and (2) community pharmacies in Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota interested in the future use of PatientToc?. Post-visit site observation debriefs were also audio-recorded. Verbatim transcripts of all recordings were coded using deductive/inductive approaches and intra-/inter-site summaries were produced identifying potential barriers, facilitators, and actionable recommendations mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs. A stakeholder advisory panel engaged in an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) implementation process. This included member checking and prioritizing findings, and feedback on the adapted PatientToc? application, implementation strategies, and accompanying toolkit for community pharmacy implementation. RESULTS: Two primary care practices, nine pharmacies, and 89 individuals participated. Eight major themes (four barriers and four facilitators) and 14 recommendations were identified. Throughout the four EBQI sessions, the panel (1) confirmed findings; (2) designated high priority recommendations: (a) explain PatientToc? and its benefits clearly and simply to patients, (b) ensure patients can complete questionnaires within 10 min, and (c) provide hands-on training/resources for pharmacy teams; and (3) provided feedback on the adapted PatientToc? application and finalized toolkit items for initial community pharmacy implementation.

Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. Methods Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of Rt. Results Across all countries, the initial median estimate for Rt was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4 C 5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58 C 1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18% C 65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower Rt during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). Conclusions In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R0 > 5. Our results are consistent with evidence that recreational activities (including restaurant and bar visits) enable super-spreading events. Exiting from lockdown therefore requires continued physical distancing and tight control on this kind of activities.","output":"Behavioral changes before lockdown and decreased retail and recreation mobility during lockdown contributed most to controlling COVID-19 in Western countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have a high mortality. Identification of patients at increased risk of adverse outcome would be important, to allow closer observation and earlier medical intervention for those at risk, and to objectively guide prognosis for friends and family of affected individuals. We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study in all-comers with COVID-19 admitted to a large general hospital in the United Kingdom. Clinical characteristics and features on admission, including observations, haematological and biochemical characteristics, were used to develop a score to predict 30-day mortality, using multivariable logistic regression. We identified 316 patients, of whom 46% died within 30-days. We developed a mortality score incorporating age, sex, platelet count, international normalised ratio, and observations on admission including the Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate and blood pressure. The score was highly predictive of 30-day mortality with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.7933 (95% CI 0.745C0.841). The optimal cut-point was a score  4, which had a sensitivity of 78.36% and a specificity of 67.59%. Patients with a score  4 had an odds ratio of 7.6 for 30-day mortality compared to those with a score < 4 (95% CI 4.56C12.49, p < 0.001). This simple, easy-to-use risk score calculator for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 is a strong predictor of 30-day mortality.

With recent improvement of techniques and accumulation of experiences, LLR in PS segments is feasible, but studies investigating the result after the modifications are lacking. METHODS In this single-center, retrospective study, 149 patients who underwent LLR for HCC located in PS segments from September 2003 to December 2016 were analyzed. The patients were divided into Group 1 (n=43) and Group 2 (n=106) who underwent LLR before and after 2012, respectively, when advanced techniques including use of intercostal trocars, Pringle maneuver, and semi-lateral position of patient were introduced. Also, these patients were compared with those who underwent open liver resection (OLR; n=124) for HCC in PS segments during the same period. RESULTS Mean operative time (394.7 minutes vs 331.2 minutes; P=0.013), intraoperative blood loss (1545.8 ml vs 1208.2 ml; P=0.020), and hospital stay (11.6 days vs 9.2, P<0.001) were significantly less in Group 2.

METHODS: This non-blinded pragmatic randomised clinical trial was conducted at the only teaching hospital in The Gambia. Eligibility criteria included weight <2000g and age 1C24 h with exclusion if stable or severely unstable. Neonates were randomly assigned to receive either standard care, including KMC once stable at >24 h after admission (control) versus KMC initiated <24 h after admission (intervention). Randomisation was stratified by weight with twins in the same arm. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 postnatal days, assessed by intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included: time to death; hypothermia and stability at 24 h; breastfeeding at discharge; infections; weight gain at 28d and admission duration. The trial was prospectively registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03555981). FINDINGS: Recruitment occurred from 23rd May 2018 to 19th March 2020. Among 1,107 neonates screened for participation 279 were randomly assigned, 139 (42% male [n = 59]) to standard care and 138 (43% male [n = 59]) to the intervention with two participants lost to follow up and no withdrawals.

There were no between-arm differences for secondary outcomes or serious adverse events (28/139 (20%) for control and 30/139 (22%) for intervention, none related). One-third of intervention neonates reverted to standard care for clinical reasons. INTERPRETATION: The trial had low power due to halving of baseline neonatal mortality, highlighting the importance of implementing existing small and sick newborn care interventions.

To explain this development, political, sociological, and psychological research has identified societal macro-phenomena as well as cognitive micro-level factors that explain how citizens reason about the science. Here we take a radically different perspective, and highlight the effects of metacognition: How citizens reason about their own reasoning. Leveraging methods from Signal Detection Theory, we investigated the importance of metacognitive insight for polarization for the heavily contested topic of climate change, and the less heavily contested topic of nanotechnology. We found that, for climate change (but not for nanotechnology), higher insight into the accuracy of own interpretations of the available scientific evidence related to a lower likelihood of polarization over the science. This finding held irrespective of the direction of the scientific evidence (endorsing or rejecting anthropogenicity of climate change). Furthermore, the polarizing effect of scientific evidence could be traced back to higher metacognitive insight fostering belief-updating in the direction of the evidence at the expense of own, prior beliefs.

(NOTES?) represents a case study in surgical procedural evolution. Beginning in 2004 with preclinical feasibility studies, and followed by the creation of the NOSCAR? collaboration between The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, procedural development followed a stepwise incremental pathway. The work of this consortium has included white paper analyses, obtaining outside independent funding for basic science and procedural development, and, ultimately, the initiation of a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing NOTES? cholecystectomy as an alternative procedure to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS Ninety patients were randomized into a randomized clinical trial with the primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority of the transvaginal and transgastric arms to the laparoscopic arm. In the original trial design, there were both transgastric and transvaginal groups to be compared to the laparoscopic control group. However, after enrollment and randomization of 6 laparoscopic controls and 4 transgastric cases into the transgastric group, this arm was ultimately deemed not practical due to lagging enrollment, and the arm was closed. Three transgastric via the transgastric approach were performed in total with 9 laparoscopic control cases enrolled through the TG arm. Overall a total of 41 transvaginal and their 39 laparoscopic cholecystectomy controls were randomized into the study with 37 transvaginal and 33 laparoscopic cholecystectomies being ultimately performed. Overall total operating time was statistically longer in the NOTES? group: 96.9 (64.97) minutes versus 52.1 (19.91) minutes. RESULTS There were no major adverse events such as common bile duct injury or return to the operating room for hemorrhage. Intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, and total medication given in the PACU were not statistically different. There were no conversions in the NOTES? group to a laparoscopic or open procedure, nor were there any injuries, bile leaks, hemorrhagic complications, wound infections, or wound dehiscence in either group. There were no readmissions. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were 3.4 (CI 2.82) in the laparoscopic group and 2.9 (CI 1.96) in the transvaginal group (p = 0.41). The clinical assessment on cosmesis scores was not statistically different when recorded by clinical observers for most characteristics measured when the transvaginal group was compared to the laparoscopic group. Taken as a whole, the results slightly favor the transvaginal group. SF-12 scores were not statistically different at all postoperative time points except for the SF-12 mental component which was superior in the transvaginal group at all time points (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The safety profile for transvaginal cholecystectomy demonstrates that this approach is safe and produces at least non-inferior clinical results with superior cosmesis, with a transient reduction in discomfort. The transvaginal approach to cholecystectomy should no longer be considered experimental. As a model for intersociety collaboration, the study demonstrated the ultimate feasibility and success of partnership as a model for basic research, procedural development, fundraising, and clinical trial execution for novel interventional concepts, regardless of physician board certification.","output":"The NOVEL trial: natural orifice versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy-a prospective, randomized evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Comprehensive case investigation and contact tracing are crucial to prevent community spread of COVID-19.

Government officials in the United States subsequently responded by issuing lockdown orders that closed schools, terminated sports, and resulted in many people transitioning to working from home, immediately affecting the ability of athletic trainers (ATs) to practice clinically. OBJECTIVE: To describe the job status, job duties, telemedicine use, and resiliency of ATs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Mixed-methods survey. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 611 ATs (age = 32  13 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The survey consisted of 6 demographic questions, a job status assessment (3 questions, 1 open-ended prompt), a telemedicine use assessment (5 questions, 2 open-ended prompts), and the 6-item Brief Resilience Scale. Qualitative analyses were completed using Text iQ technology and descriptive statistics, and cross-tabulations were conducted using follow-up &#967;2 comparisons of resiliency with job setting and telemedicine use. RESULTS: Most ATs continued to work in some capacity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed optimism about the likelihood that their job status and setting would return. However, participants shared financial and mental health concerns because of reduced pay, stress, and uncertainty about the future. We also identified versatility within the profession, as ATs were serving in new roles related to COVID-19 or adopting telemedicine (n = 251, 41.1%). Athletic trainers were implementing all domains of clinical practice using telemedicine, yet most did not consult legal counsel on or have formal training in the delivery method before implementation. Finally, most ATs exhibited normal resilience that was not affected by job setting (&#967;2 = 26.901, P = .68) or the use of virtual health care (&#967;2 = 2.597, P = .27). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected ATs' jobs, and in many cases, the ATs have demonstrated adaptability and value in assuming various roles in the larger health care system.","output":"Athletic Trainers' Job Tasks and Status During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Preliminary Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning (ML) algorithms may help better understand the complex interactions among factors that influence dietary choices and behaviors. The aim of this study was to explore whether ML algorithms are more accurate than traditional statistical models in predicting vegetable and fruit (VF) consumption. A large array of features (2,452 features from 525 variables) encompassing individual and environmental information related to dietary habits and food choices in a sample of 1,147 French-speaking adult men and women was used for the purpose of this study. Adequate VF consumption, which was defined as 5 servings/d or more, was measured by averaging data from three web-based 24 h recalls and used as the outcome to predict. Nine classification ML algorithms were compared to two traditional statistical predictive models, logistic regression and penalized regression (Lasso). The performance of the predictive ML algorithms was tested after the implementation of adjustments, including normalizing the data, as well as in a series of sensitivity analyses such as using VF consumption obtained from a web-based food frequency questionnaire (wFFQ) and applying a feature selection algorithm in an attempt to reduce overfitting. Logistic regression and Lasso predicted adequate VF consumption with an accuracy of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58C0.70) and 0.64 (95%CI: 0.60C0.68) respectively. Among the ML algorithms tested, the most accurate algorithms to predict adequate VF consumption were the support vector machine (SVM) with either a radial basis kernel or a sigmoid kernel, both with an accuracy of 0.65 (95%CI: 0.59C0.71). The least accurate ML algorithm was the SVM with a linear kernel with an accuracy of 0.55 (95%CI: 0.49C0.61). Using dietary intake data from the wFFQ and applying a feature selection algorithm had little to no impact on the performance of the algorithms. In summary, ML algorithms and traditional statistical models predicted adequate VF consumption with similar accuracies among adults. These results suggest that additional research is needed to explore further the true potential of ML in predicting dietary behaviours that are determined by complex interactions among several individual, social and environmental factors.","output":"Are Machine Learning Algorithms More Accurate in Predicting Vegetable and Fruit Consumption Than Traditional Statistical Models?

Severe COVID-19 was initially proposed to be secondary to cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). However, studies since showed that patients with severe COVID-19 rarely display CSS cytokine phenotypes, and may have more limited inflammatory responses instead. METHODS: Prospective cohorts, aged 0-90 years of age who tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled from inpatient hospitals and outpatient testing centers in Memphis, TN from May 2020-January 2021. Longitudinal blood samples were obtained including acute, sub-acute and convalescent timepoints. Severity scores of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 were assigned at time of convalescent assessment. Plasma was analyzed with a quantitative human magnetic 38-plex cytokine assay. RESULTS: : 169 participants were enrolled, including 8 asymptomatic, 117 mild, 22 moderate and 17 severe cases, and 5 children with post-COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). All moderate and severe patients were hospitalized and received treatment (39%). Clear distinctions were seen between asymptomatic-mild cases and moderate-severe cases at acute timepoints and during disease progression for GCSF, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-1Ra, IP-10, MIP-1a, MIP-1, and TGF. There was a significant difference between participants who did and did not require hospitalization for acute timepoint levels of IL-10, IL-15, MIP-1  and TGF (p< 0.01). Only 4 participants with active COVID-19 were found to meet criteria for CSS (2%), only 3 of which were severe. MIS-C participants showed nearly universally elevated cytokine levels compared to those with active COVID-19. Temporal and severity associations of IL-10 and IP-10 [Image: see text] Figure 1. Temporal and severity associations of IL-10 and IP-10 Examples of differentiating cytokine profiles by severity and time. Among SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants, IL-10 and IP-10 displayed increased levels in their acute plasma samples as clinical severity increased [A,C]. IL-10 and IP-10 also showed distinct time-dependent responses (ln(Cytokine level (pg/mL)) that differentiated the more severe from the less severe groups [B,D]. CONCLUSION: Moderate and severe acute COVID-19 has a distinct cytokine profile from asymptomatic and mild cases, as detected from acute, subacute and convalescent plasma.

In the present study, we isolated PED virus (PEDV) circulating in Japan using Vero cell cultures and analyzed sequences of S1 genes of these PEDV isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that one of these strains contained distinct insertion and deletions in the S gene (i.e., S INDEL). Furthermore, inoculation of PEDV into 1-week-old pigs demonstrated that the S INDEL strain had a lower pathogenicity than the North American (NA) prototype strain. This is the first report comparing pathogenicity of an S INDEL strain with the NA prototype strain following experimental inoculation. Excretion of PEDV in the feces of S INDEL strain-inoculated pigs occurred later than in NA prototype strain-inoculated pigs. Thus, our findings suggested that the S INDEL strain had different viral dynamics than the NA prototype strain.","output":"Isolation and experimental inoculation of an S INDEL strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been proposed as treatments for COVID-19.

The pathophysiological role of oxidative stress in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been well-documented. Additional oxidative stress caused by CQ/HCQ during ARDS could be problematic. In vitro data showing that CQ forms a complex with free-heme that promotes lipid peroxidation of phospholipid bilayers are also relevant to COVID-19. Free-heme induced oxidative stress is implicated as a systemic activator of coagulation, which is increasingly recognized as a contributor to COVID-19 morbidity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinic-demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and high-sensitivity troponin I were extracted from the electronic database. Mortality and other clinical complications, including respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury were recorded. Myocardial injury was defined as having a serum troponin I value >19.8 ng/mL. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to determine survival times and independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients were included. Seventy-seven patients (23.8%) had acute myocardial injury. The primary outcome measure, namely death, occurred in 54.5% and 3.2% of the patients with and without myocardial injury, respectively. Notably, 75.3% of the patients with myocardial injury and 6.5% of the patients without myocardial injury developed ARDS. Overall, 50 out of 324 patients (15.4%) died during the study period.

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs, brain, and heart are also susceptible to infection. An understanding of factors critical for viral infection in these tissues may help identify novel therapeutics. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. We identified both novel as well as previously validated host factors. Notably, we used replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 to validate new viral-entry promoting genes, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We found that the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Our analysis of human olfactory neuroepithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies--have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2, suggesting that the presence of KCNA6 may explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top screen hits. We then performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of [~]8 million patients and found a clinical association between screen-identified drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. We have thus identified the potassium channel KCNA6 as a SARS-CoV-2 host factor, expanded our understanding of potential viral tropism, and identified promising targets for drug repurposing and development.","output":"CRISPRa screening with real world evidence identifies potassium channels as neuronal entry factors and druggable targets for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case report of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) due to coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance. METHODS: We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID-19 survivors including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, serum troponin and NT-proBNP assay 1-4 weeks after hospital discharge. Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed according to initial screening results. RESULTS: The mean age was 46.5  18.6 years; 53.6% were men. All were classified with non-severe disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care. Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 42.3% including sinus bradycardia (29.9%), newly detected T-wave abnormality (8.2%), elevated troponin level (6.2%), newly detected atrial fibrillation (1.0%), and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NT-proBNP level (1.0%). Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 7.2% COVID-19 survivors, which appeared to be self-limiting and recovered over time. For COVID-19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVID-survivors with mild disease, which is mostly self-limiting.

To better understand these mechanisms, Rag2-/-Il10-/- mice were infected with Helicobacter hepaticus to induce chronic inflammation of the cecum and the colon. Transcriptomic data from harvested proximal colon samples were used to generate a customized FASTA database containing non-canonical protein sequences. Using a proteogenomic approach, mass spectrometry data for proximal colon proteins were searched against this custom FASTA database using the Galaxy for Proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform. In addition to the increased abundance in inflammatory response proteins, we also discovered several non-canonical peptide sequences derived from unique proteoforms. We confirmed the veracity of these novel sequences using an automated bioinformatics verification workflow with targeted MS-based assays for peptide validation. Our bioinformatics discovery workflow identified 235 putative non-canonical peptide sequences, of which 58 were verified with high confidence and 39 were validated in targeted proteomics assays. This study provides insights into challenges faced when identifying non-canonical peptides using a proteogenomics approach and demonstrates an integrated workflow addressing these challenges.

In this study, the aim was to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and the cases are COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS: Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Amongst these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, fewer comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-reactive protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, whilst urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available for 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%) patients, of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and of holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection.

METHODS: The Becton Dickinson Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube? (MGIT) system was used at six laboratories to determine the MICs of a phylogenetically diverse collection of 356 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains to establish the epidemiological cut-off value for pretomanid. MICs were correlated with WGS data to study the genetic basis of differences in the susceptibility to pretomanid. RESULTS: We observed ancient differences in the susceptibility to pretomanid among various members of MTBC. Most notably, lineage 1 of M. tuberculosis, which is estimated to account for 28% of tuberculosis cases globally, was less susceptible than lineages 2, 3, 4 and 7 of M. tuberculosis, resulting in a 99th percentile of 2a? mg/L for lineage 1 compared with 0.5a? mg/L for the remaining M. tuberculosis lineages. Moreover, we observed that higher MICs (8a? mg/L), which probably confer resistance, had recently evolved independently in six different M. tuberculosis strains. Unlike the aforementioned ancient differences in susceptibility, these recent differences were likely caused by mutations in the known pretomanid resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these findings, the provisional critical concentration of 1a? mg/L for MGIT set by EMA must be re-evaluated.

Human milk banks (HMBs) screen and recruit milk donors, and DHM principally feeds very low birth weight babies, reducing the risk of complications and supporting maternal breastfeeding where used alongside optimal lactation support. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a range of challenges to HMBs worldwide. This study aimed to understand the impacts of the pandemic on HMB services and develop initial guidance regarding risk limitation. A Virtual Collaborative Network (VCN) comprising over 80 HMB leaders from 36 countries was formed in March 2020 and included academics and nongovernmental organisations. Individual milk banks, national networks and regional associations submitted data regarding the number of HMBs, volume of DHM produced and number of recipients in each global region. Estimates were calculated in the context of missing or incomplete data. Through open-ended questioning, the experiences of milk banks from each country in the first 2 months of the pandemic were collected and major themes identified. According to data collected from 446 individual HMBs, more than 800,000 infants receive DHM worldwide each year. Seven pandemic-related specific vulnerabilities to service provision were identified, including sufficient donors, prescreening disruption, DHM availability, logistics, communication, safe handling and contingency planning, which were highly context-dependent.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An online platform was used for a consensus meeting of 114 participants, including health planning experts, health-care institution managers, clinicians and patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Criteria and indicators for the achievement of person-centred care. MAIN RESULTS: The first round began with 125 proposals and 11 dimensions. After the second round, 28 ideas reached a high level of consensus among the participants. Ultimately, the workgroup agreed on 20 criteria for goals in the implementation of person-centred care during the COVID-19 era and 21 related indicators to measure goal achievement. DISCUSSION: Nine dimensions and 28 priorities were identified. These priorities are also in accordance with the quadruple aim approach, which emphasizes the need for care for health-care professionals, without whom it is impossible to achieve a better quality of care.

Domestic violence during pregnancy can be associated with fatal and non-fatal adverse health outcomes due to the direct trauma to a pregnant womans body and to the effect of stress on fetal growth and development. Emotional violence is a risk factor for prenatal and/or postpartum depression. Recent studies focusing on abusive situations during peripartum and possible preventive strategies were identified in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, and ScienceDirect. All of the available literature was retrospectively reviewed with a special attention to peer-reviewed publications from the last ten years. Results of the present narrative review suggest that perinatal health care professionals (general practitioners, gynecologists, obstetricians, psychologists, psychiatrists) should promptly detect interpersonal violence during and after pregnancy and provide health care for pregnant women. It seems pivotal to guarantee psychological care for abused women before, during, and after pregnancy in order to prevent the risk of depressive symptoms, other mental or physical sequelae, and mother-to-infant bonding failure. There is an urgent need for multifaceted interventions: programs should focus on several risk factors and should design tailored care pathways fitted to the specific needs of women and finalized to support them across the lifespan.","output":"Caring for Mothers: A Narrative Review on Interpersonal Violence and Peripartum Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disaster of the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the norms of psychiatric practice: from its methods of care delivery to its methods of practice. Traditional methods of care delivery using in-person visits became impractical or unsafe. Meanwhile, the pandemic has resulted in an increased demand for services. The resulting pivot to telepsychiatry required a skillset that was not a part of traditional psychiatry training. To meet the demand for services, many providers needed to join collaborative models of care to help scale their expertise. Although many innovative collaborative models of care exist, providers remain in their traditional consultative roles within many of those models. In a disaster, when there is an expanding mental health care need in the population, psychiatrists need to adapt their practice to meet expanded roles that naturally build on their usual ones. We explore the expanded roles that psychiatrists will need to fill based on what is known about the field of disaster mental health and principles from Psychological First Aid (PFA). In preparation for a new normal, in what George Everly describes as a disaster of uncertainty, we propose evolutions in the way psychiatrists are trained. Specific training on telepsychiatry best practices will prepare psychiatrists to use this method most effectively and appropriately. Additional training should focus on the core competencies of disaster psychiatry: effective crisis leadership and strategic planning, disaster surveillance, knowledge of benign vs. concerning symptoms, psychological triage, implementation of crisis interventions, resource facilitation, crisis communication, and self and peer care. Developing and integrating these competencies into psychiatry training programs will best prepare psychiatrists for the expanding mental health care needs of the community in this ongoing disaster and future ones.

The molecular mechanism by which flooding mitigates the damage induced by LT stress has not been fully elucidated. Thus, LT stress at 8 C, LT accompanied by flooding (LTF) and CK (control) treatments were established for 3 days to determine the transcriptomic, proteomic and physiological response in direct seeded rice seedlings at the seedling stage. RESULTS: LT damaged chloroplasts, and thylakoid lamellae, and increased osmiophilic bodies and starch grains compared to CK, but LTF alleviated the damage to chloroplast structure caused by LT. The physiological characteristics of treated plants showed that compared with LT, LTF significantly increased the contents of rubisco, chlorophyll, PEPCK, ATP and GA(3) but significantly decreased soluble protein, MDA and ABA contents. 4D-label-free quantitative proteomic profiling showed that photosynthesis-responsive proteins, such as phytochrome, as well as chlorophyll and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly downregulated in LT/CK and LTF/CK comparison groups. However, compared with LT, phytochrome, chlorophyllide oxygenase activity and the glucan branching enzyme in LTF were significantly upregulated in rice leaves. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies identified 72,818 transcripts and 5639 proteins, and 4983 genes that were identified at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were significantly enriched in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: Through transcriptomic, proteomic and physiological analyses, we determined that a variety of metabolic pathway changes were induced by LT and LTF. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses demonstrated that DEGs and DEPs were associated with photosynthesis pathways, antioxidant enzymes and energy metabolism pathway-related proteins. Our study provided new insights for efforts to reduce the damage to direct seeded rice caused by low-temperature stress and provided a breeding target for low temperature flooding-resistant cultivars. Further analysis of translational regulation and metabolites may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which flooding mitigates low-temperature stress in direct seeded early indica rice at the seedling stage.

However, the impact of respiratory viruses could have been underestimated because of the low detection rate by conventional laboratory methods. METHODS: Children with CF had nasal swabs and sputum samples obtained on a routine basis and when they developed respiratory exacerbations. Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) was used to detect respiratory viruses from nasal swabs. The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if the peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child's usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold. RESULTS: 71 patients had 165 reported episodes of respiratory exacerbations. 138 exacerbation samples were obtained of which 63 (46%) were positive for respiratory viruses. In contrast, 23 of 136 asymptomatic nasal swabs (16.9%) were positive for respiratory viruses. There was significantly more viruses being detected during respiratory exacerbations, in particular influenza A, influenza B and rhinovirus (p < 0.05). Upper respiratory symptoms significantly correlated with positive respiratory viral detection (p < 0.05). This study also showed that viral respiratory exacerbations in CF could be independent from bacterial infections.

ALTER1202 confirmed the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as a third- or further-line option for relapsed SCLC. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of anlotinib compared with placebo as third- or further-line treatment for advanced SCLC in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of advanced SCLC and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of anlotinib versus placebo. The health outcomes and utilities were derived from the ALTER1202 (NCT03059797) and published sources, respectively. Total costs were calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the model uncertainties. RESULTS: Anlotinib was estimated to result in an additional 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $2131.32, resulting in an ICER of $17,741.94/QALY. The ICER did not exceed the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30,833 per QALY, which was three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of China in 2019. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of anlotinib exerted the maximum influence on the result of the model, followed by the utility of progression-free survival (PFS) state in the anlotinib group and median overall survival (mOS) in the anlotinib group. In PSA, the probability of anlotinib being cost-effective was 26.6% and 78.5% when the WTP threshold was one and three times the GDP per capita, respectively.

Whether vitamin D is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the last vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing is associated with COVID-19 test results. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study at an urban academic medical center included patients with a 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol level measured within 1 year before being tested for COVID-19 from March 3 to April 10, 2020. EXPOSURES: Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the last measurement of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol less than 20 ng/mL or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol less than 18 pg/mL before COVID-19 testing. Treatment changes were defined by changes in vitamin D type and dose between the date of the last vitamin D level measurement and the date of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize the most recent vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing as likely deficient (last level deficient and treatment not increased), likely sufficient (last level not deficient and treatment not decreased), and 2 groups with uncertain deficiency (last level deficient and treatment increased, and last level not deficient and treatment decreased). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome was a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test result. Multivariable analysis tested whether vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing was associated with testing positive for COVID-19, controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. RESULTS: A total of 489 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [18.4] years; 366 [75%] women; and 331 [68%] race other than White) had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 124 participants (25%), likely sufficient for 287 (59%), and uncertain for 78 (16%). Overall, 71 participants (15%) tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age up to age 50 years (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .02); non-White race (relative risk, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.26-5.12; P = .009), and likely deficient vitamin D status (relative risk, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.81; P = .02) compared with likely sufficient vitamin D status.

DESIGN: To analyze prospective reports of student-athletes with COVID-19-positive tests to assess prevention strategies and risk factors by sports and seasons. SETTING: Minnesota high schools. PARTICIPANTS: Fall 2020 (August 24-October 30) and winter 2021 (January 2-March 12) student-athletes. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS: Sports, indoor location, mask use, physical distancing, and season. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19-positive test rates. METHODS: Self-selected schools voluntarily reported, in 2-week intervals, the number of student-athletes with COVID-19-positive tests in each sport and the number of athletes participating in each sport during the fall and winter sports seasons. The positive testing rates per 100 000 athletes were calculated for participants in each sport and compared by sports type and risk variables. RESULTS: The high school age community-positive testing rate was 1298 per 100 000 students in the fall and 2396 in the winter. The student-athlete positive testing rate was 1500 per 100 000 athletes during the fall and 2800 during the winter (2 = 1.98, df = 1, P = 0.350). Positive tests per 100 000 athletes ranged from 197 (girls alpine skiing) to 4151 (wrestling). The incidence rates comparing indoor with outdoor sports (P = 0.001) and close-contact with physically distanced sports (P = 0.023) were significantly different, but the incidence rates comparing indoor masked with unmasked sports (P = ns) were not different. CONCLUSION: Athletes competing in outdoor individual sports have less risk of a COVID-19-positive test compared with age-matched individuals in the community and indoor sports participants either wearing or not wearing masks during competition. Unmasked athletes in close proximity have the highest positive test rates, and unenforced masking is not associated with lower positive testing rates.

At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, our PTB prevention clinic manages the care of approximately 1000 women/year. Women referred to the clinic are seen from 12 weeks of pregnancy with subsequent appointments every 2C4 weeks to measure cervical length (CL) using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Women with a history of cervical weakness or short cervix on TVUS are offered a cervical cerclage. LOCAL PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women were strongly advised to avoid social mixing and public transport. The National Health Service had to rapidly adopt remote consultation and redesign clinical pathways in order to reduce transmission, exposure and spread among women at high risk of PTB. METHODS: We focused on Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound aims and used a driver diagram to visualise our changes. We used a series of Plan Do Study Act cycles to evaluate and adapt change ideas through the UKs national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic between 23 March and 29 May 2020. RESULTS: We reduced the number of face-to-face appointments by 54%. This was achieved by increasing remote telephone consultations from 0% to 64%, and by reducing the intensity of surveillance. The rate of regional anaesthetic was increased from 53% to 95% for cerclage placement in order to minimise the number of aerosol-generating procedures. Patient and staff satisfaction responses to these changes were used to tailor practices. No women tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: By using quality improvement methodology, we were able to safely and rapidly implement a new care pathway for women at high risk of PTB which was acceptable to patients and staff, and effective in reducing exposure of COVID-19.","output":"Rapid quality improvement in a preterm birth clinic care pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In this paper we examine two policy questions about the COVID 19 pandemic in the Philippines.

Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity centre. DESIGN, INTERVENTION: The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (n=30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (n=30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-posttest design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS: Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group ((p)(2)=0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, (p)(2)=0.23). Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group ((p)(2)=0.23C0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home. The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone.

Typically, these models use statistical predictive methods to capture the structure of the underlying stochastic process without taking into consideration estimation errors and model misspecification. In this context, we propose a data-driven prescriptive analytics framework aiming to integrate the machine learning and dynamic optimization machinery in a consistent and efficient way to build a bridge from data to decisions. The proposed framework tackles a relevant class of dynamic decision problems comprising many important practical applications. The basic building blocks of our proposed framework are: (1) a Hidden Markov Model as a predictive (machine learning) method to represent uncertainty; and (2) a distributionally robust dynamic optimization model as a prescriptive method that takes into account estimation errors associated with the predictive model and allows for control of the risk associated with decisions. Moreover, we present an evaluation framework to assess out-of-sample performance in rolling horizon schemes. A complete case study on dynamic asset allocation illustrates the proposed framework showing superior out-of-sample performance against selected benchmarks. The numerical results show the practical importance and applicability of the proposed framework since it extracts valuable information from data to obtain robustified decisions with an empirical certificate of out-of-sample performance evaluation.","output":"A data-driven approach for a class of stochastic dynamic optimization problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION There is limited evidence on the safety and outcome of induction of breech labor. In this study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of spontaneous and induced breech deliveries and to describe variations in induction rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 1054 singleton live fetuses in breech presentation at Trondheim University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. The main outcome was intrapartum cesarean section, and secondary outcomes were postpartum hemorrhage, anal sphincter ruptures, Apgar scores, pH in the umbilical artery and metabolic acidosis. All data were obtained from the hospital birth journal. RESULTS Induction of labor was performed in 127/606 (21.0%) of women with planned vaginal birth. The frequency of intrapartum cesarean section was 48.0% for induced labor vs 45.7% for spontaneous labor (p=0.64). We found no differences in the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage or anal sphincter ruptures between induced and spontaneous births. The median pH in the umbilical artery was significantly lower in neonates with induced labor compared with neonates with spontaneous labor (7.22 vs 7.25; p=0.02). The frequency of pH <7.05 was 7.0% for induced labor vs 2.9% (p= 0.05) for spontaneous labor, but the frequency of pH <7.0 was not significantly different: 2.6% vs 0.8% (p=0.14), respectively. Three neonates with planned vaginal birth had metabolic acidosis: two with spontaneous labors and one with induced labor. Three fetuses with planned vaginal birth died during labor: two with spontaneous onset of labor and one with induced labor. All three were extremely preterm: two were delivered in week 23 and one in week 25. We did not observe any significant trend in induction rates in either parous or in nulliparous women. CONCLUSIONS The induction rates were stable during the study period. We did not observe any significant difference in intrapartum cesarean section rates, in the frequency of pH <7.0 in the umbilical artery, or in the frequency of metabolic acidosis when comparing induced and spontaneous breech deliveries.","output":"Induction of labor in breech presentations, a retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suicide rates appear to be influenced by the economy.

In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex-biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We found that male and female GBM cells exhibited opposing responses to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Brd4. Brd4 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition decreased male GBM cell clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenesis, while increasing both in female GBM cells. These results were validated in male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal of human GBM samples segregated by sex revealed that male GBM cells are significantly more sensitive to BET inhibitors than are female cells. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. This has important implications for the clinical evaluation and use of BET inhibitors. Significance Consistent sex differences in incidence and outcome have been reported in numerous cancers including brain tumors. GBM, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, occurs with higher incidence and shorter survival in males compared to females. Brd4 is essential for regulating transcriptome-wide gene expression and specifying cell identity, including that of GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. The observed sex differences in BETi treatment strongly indicate that sex differences in disease biology translate into sex differences in therapeutic responses. This has critical implications for clinical use of BET inhibitors further affirming the importance of inclusion of sex as a biological variable.","output":"Brd4-bound enhancers drive cell intrinsic sex differences in glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the advanced PCR-based assays available, a fraction of the pediatric respiratory infections remain unexplained every epidemic season, and there is a perception that novel viruses might be present in these specimens.

This study aims to explore the potential use of lung lesion features in the management of COVID-19, based on the assumption that lesion features may carry important diagnostic and prognostic information for quantifying infection severity and forecasting disease progression. A novel LesionEncoder framework is proposed to detect lesions in chest CT scans and to encode lesion features for automatic severity assessment and progression prediction. The LesionEncoder framework consists of a U-Net module for detecting lesions and extracting features from individual CT slices, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) module for learning the relationship between feature vectors and collectively classifying the sequence of feature vectors. Chest CT scans of two cohorts of COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in China were used for training and testing the proposed framework. When applied to assessing severity, this framework outperformed baseline methods achieving a sensitivity of 0.818, specificity of 0.952, accuracy of 0.940, and AUC of 0.903. It also outperformed the other tested methods in disease progression prediction with a sensitivity of 0.667, specificity of 0.838, accuracy of 0.829, and AUC of 0.736. The LesionEncoder framework demonstrates a strong potential for clinical application in current COVID-19 management, particularly in automatic severity assessment of COVID-19 patients.

It is often confused with child murder, neonaticide, filicide or even genderside. Each of these concepts has to be defined clearly in order to be understood. Through time reasons for infanticide have evolved depending on multiple factors such as culture, religion, beliefs system, or attempts to control the population. It was once seen as a moral virtue. So what has changed? SUBJECTS AND METHODS Between January 2020 and May 2020, a literature search based on electronic bibliographic databases as well as other sources of information (grey literature) was conducted in order to investigate the most recent data on infanticide and child murder, especially the newest socio-economic and psychiatric considerations as well as the different reasons why a mother or a father ends up killing their own child and the Irish situation. RESULTS Recent works on the subject demonstrate how some new socio economic factors and family considerations impact on infanticide. Mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often part of the picture and represent a very high risk factor to commit infanticide and filicide. Fathers and mothers do not proceed the same way nor for the same reasons when they kill their offspring. Neonaticide and infanticide are almost always committed by women. A recent case in Ireland (2020) proves how filicide remains an actual problem. CONCLUSIONS Filicide is a relatively rare event, and therefore particularly impact both the public and the press when it occurs. Infanticide does not result from a unique cause, but from multiple factors (some being well known, some remaining hypothetical). Psychopathological and socio-economical parameters associated to peculiar family grounds are currently prevalent.

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation.

Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

Methods: Our scheme identifies at-risk regions using existing cellular network functionalities handover and cell (re)selectionused to maintain seamless coverage for mobile end-user equipment (UE) . The frequency of handover and cell (re)selection events is highly reflective of the density of mobile people in the area because virtually everyone carries UEs.

Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002). Conclusion: About half of our physicians had different levels of anxiety during the pandemic, and this anxiety seemed to be more related to infecting their relatives. Participants thought that providing health care services with telemedicine during the pandemic period would be beneficial and reduce the spread of hospital-acquired COVID-19. However, there was no consensus among the participants regarding the use of telemedicine in the postpandemic period.","output":"Being a Physician in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic and Alternative Health Care Service: Telemedicine: Prospective Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a global impediment to educational delivery.

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study SETTING:: One Level 1 Trauma Center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York CityPatients/Participants: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85, range: 65 - 100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020 to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS: Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n=9; 7 preoperatively, 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n=1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d=-0.83; p=0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d=-0.17; p=0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; OR 30.0, 95% CI 4.3-207; p=0.001). Including the one presumed positive case in the COVID+ cohort increased this difference (60% vs. 2%; OR 72.0, 95% CI 7.9-754; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection had worse ASA scores but similar baseline comorbidities with significantly higher rates of inpatient mortality compared to those without concomitant COVID-19 infection.

The mechanism is unclear but may include delay or deferral of care, or differential treatment during hospitalization because of strains on hospital capacity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used emergency department and inpatient data from a 12\\\\hospital health system to examine changes in volume, patient age and comorbidities, treatment (right\\\\ and left\\\\heart catheterization), and outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF) during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic compared with pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 (2018 and 2019), controlling for seasonal variation.

Since then, new cases of COVID-19 emerge all over the world each day, having a fatal outcome chiefly in those who belong to high risk groups. In order to prevent the disease spread, health regulations have been brought in by the authorities. They have become obligatory to follow in numerous countries, including Georgia, which confirmed its first case in Tbilisi on February 26. During the pandemic, it is crucial for people, especially health care workers to have access to reliable information regarding the disease and its spread. One of the most important groups in this field are the medical students. The purpose of this study was to evaluate awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 among medical students in Tbilisi, Georgia. An online survey was conducted using Google forms and posted in Facebook groups. There were 18 questions in total and the language used was Georgian. All questions were marked as \\"required\\" to encourage completion. In total, 178 participants completed the questionnaire from 4 different medical universities of Tbilisi.

However, there is a lack of consensus on how to deal with patients of vitiligo, as we battle this pandemic. AIM: To conduct a questionnaire-based survey, amongst expert dermatologists; in order to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the management of vitiligo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online semi-structured English questionnaire was prepared and the link was circulated among 50 pan-Indian expert dermatologists, through various platforms (snowball sampling). Confidentiality and anonymity were strictly maintained. Responses were analyzed at the end of the study and a consensus statement was generated. RESULTS: 42.22% of the respondents believed that teleconsultation is adequate for the diagnosis and management of most cases of vitiligo. 64.44% were found to be comfortable in prescribing oral medications, even during the COVID-19 pandemic; of which 62% would prefer to prescribe systemic steroids; followed by 17%, 11%, 7%, and 3% who would prefer cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate, respectively. 64.44% respondents would recommend phototherapy in their office and 80% would prefer home-based phototherapy (PUVAsol or handheld NBUVB devices). 86.67% would prefer to stop the oral immunosuppressive drugs, till the COVID-19 RTPCR positive patients are tested negative. LIMITATIONS: The results are based on a survey of a small albeit selected group of dermatologists who decided on the currently available information on COVID-19. The same may change depending on the nature of further available information on the virus and its effect on how we manage the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cases for initial consultation may be seen physically, and those for follow-up may be scheduled for teleconsultation. Topical therapy may be used without any hesitation. Phototherapy may be best advised with either PUVAsol or home-based phototherapy units (handheld NBUVB devices).

To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","output":"Mutations in spike protein and allele variations in ACE2 impact targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results of invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in COVID-19 patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome are discouraging despite its prompt use. However noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is yet not a common practice internationally because of lack of global evidence advocating its effective use in severe cases of ARDS as well as dreadful concern about aerosol generation especially in patients having COVID-19 infection. Objective: To determine whether, NIPPV application is effective and safe in COVID-19 Patients. Methods: One hundred and thirty hemodynamically stable patients with severe CARDS as per Berlin definition (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <= 100mm Hg), having GCS > 13, respiratory breathing index (RBI) < 105, and without any systemic complication were selected. They were managed with NIPPV in Corona Intensive Care Unit of Mayo Hospital/King Edward Medical University Lahore. A little innovation was done with the application of a specific orofacial interface, fitted with heat and moist exchanger (HME) at the interface and viral/bacterial filters at the expiratory limb of ventilatory circuit. Favorable outcome has been observed in 64% of treated cases in terms of improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, thus abating severity of ARDS from severe to mild category, in an average time span of 6 days. Remaining 36% of patients progressed to IPPV with definitive airway. During study period, 4.2% of healthcare workers (HCW) got infected with COVID-19. Associated complications of NIPPV application were claustrophobia (13.8%), nasal crusting (6.9%), aspiration (6.1%) and barotrauma (0.7%).

Aim: The objective of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale (BPNS) based on self-determination theory with older adults. Methods: A total of 809 older adults were invited to participate in this study. We examined the item analysis, internal reliability, factorial validity, criterion validity, and measurement invariance across sex of a Chinese translation of the BPNS. Results: The findings demonstrated that the scale had a good factorial validity, criterion validity, and satisfactory internal reliability. All the items were qualified according to item analysis (p < 0.001). The Cronbachs  coefficient for the total scale was 0.877. The coefficients of three subscales were 0.826 (autonomy), 0.807 (competence), and 0.847 (relatedness). Exploratory factor analysis indicated three factors that explained 75.12% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis showed measurement fit exceeded the recommended criteria in all the cases.

This equipment must be appropriate to the pathogen transmission route that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, occurs through droplet and contact routes.

However, fast genome variation timely results in the insurgence of high pathogenic strains, which when infecting poultry birds may cause a million deaths and strong commercial damage. More importantly, the host shift may concern these viruses and sustained human-to-human transmission may result in a dangerous pandemic outbreak. Therefore, fingerprints specific to either low or high pathogenic strains may represent a very important tool for global surveillance. RESULTS: We combined Normal Modes Analysis and surface electrostatic analysis of a mixed strain dataset of influenza A virus haemagglutinins from high and low pathogenic strains in order to infer specific fingerprints. Normal Modes Analysis sorted the strains in two different, homogeneous clusters; sorting was independent of clades and specific instead to high vs low pathogenicity. A deeper analysis of fluctuations and flexibility regions unveiled a special role for the 110-helix region. Specific sorting was confirmed by surface electrostatics analysis, which further allowed to focus on regions and mechanisms possibly crucial to the low-to-high transition. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from previous work demonstrated that changes in surface electrostatics are associated with the evolution and spreading of avian influenza A virus clades, and seemingly involved also in the avian to mammalian host shift. This work shows that a combination of electrostatics and Normal Modes Analysis can also identify fingerprints specific to high and low pathogenicity. The possibility to predict which specific mutations may result in a shift to high pathogenicity may help in surveillance and vaccine development.","output":"Normal modes analysis and surface electrostatics of haemagglutinin proteins as fingerprints for high pathogenic type A influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19 In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures","output":"[Management of a radiotherapy center during the COVID-19 outbreak: The experience of the Mulhouse hospital centre (France)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many lives are in danger.

AI techniques are used to increase the detection speed of masked and unmasked faces. In this research, a novel dataset and two different methods are proposed to detect masked and unmasked faces in real-time. In the first method, an object detection model is applied to find and classify masked and unmasked faces. In the second method, a YOLO face detector spots faces (whether masked or not), and then the faces are classified into masked and unmasked categories with a novel fast yet effective CNN architecture. By the methods proposed in this paper, the accuracy of 99.5% is achieved on the newly collected dataset.","output":"A Face-Mask Detection Approach based on YOLO Applied for a New Collected Dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spain has been in a state of emergency since 14th March due to the COVID-19 crisis. This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress. Greater symptomatology has also been found among the younger population and in people with chronic diseases. We discuss the need to continue carrying out these types of studies to prevent and treat psychological problems that could emerge amidst this pandemic.","output":"Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that current gendered and racially biased structures put in place to deal with the crises lead women and BAME population to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Yet, there is less information on how different groups respond to the pandemic in terms of compliance with the measures implemented by the government, and the role that parenthood and employment play in explaining compliance for such groups. We take insights from the literature on policy preferences and compliance to argue that gender, ethnicity, parenthood and employment are associated with high levels of worry about the consequences of the pandemic, leading to variations in compliance with social distancing measures. We test our argument using data from an original nationally representative survey. Results indicate that women and BAME respondents present important challenges to manage anxiety, stress and worry but they manifest differently in their compliance with social distancing measures. We also find that parenthood and employment affect compliance but in an unexpected direction. Together, results indicate that compliance is not only a matter of individual choice but also a matter of structural and contextual factors.

In our recent study, we explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for clinical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection compared with qRT-PCR using the same primer/probe sets issued by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) targeting viral ORF1ab or N gene, which showed that ddPCR could largely minimize the false negatives reports resulted by qRT-PCR [Suo T, Liu X, Feng J, et al. ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens. medRxiv [Internet]. 2020;2020.02.29.20029439.

Here, we further stringently compared the performance of qRT-PCR and ddPCR for 8 primer/probe sets with the same clinical samples and conditions. Results showed that none of 8 primer/probe sets used in qRT-PCR could significantly distinguish true negatives and positives with low viral load (10-4 dilution). Moreover, false positive reports of qRT-PCR with UCDC-N1, N2 and CCDC-N primers/probes sets were observed. In contrast, ddPCR showed significantly better performance in general for low viral load samples compared to qRT-PCR. Remarkably, the background readouts of ddPCR are relatively lower, which could efficiently reduce the production of false positive reports.","output":"Analytical comparisons of SARS-COV-2 detection by qRT-PCR and ddPCR with multiple primer/probe sets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: AKI is a strong risk factor for adverse outcomes during Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the general population. CKD has been correlated with increased risk of AKI both in the outpatient and inpatient settings. We aimed to define potential risk factors for AKI among patients with non-dialysis CKD admitted due to COVID-19. METHOD: Multicenter, observational cohort study including 136 adult patients with CKDand 136 age- and sex-matched controls who required admission for COVID-19 in three academic hospitals. Viral infection was confirmed by real-time RT-qPCR and/or serologic testing in all cases. Disease severity on admission was classified according to the WHOChina Joint Mission Report on COVID-19; briefly subjects with COVID-19 were divided into mild (laboratory confirmed, without pneumonia), moderate (laboratory confirmed with pneumonia), severe (dyspnea and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24C48 h) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or other organ failure that requires intensive care). AKI was defined using the 2012 KDIGO classification. CKD was defined as sustained eGFR <60 and >15 ml/min/1.73m2 within the 6 months prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. Baseline eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from medical records. Outcomes were recorded during the following 28 days after admission. We applied logistic regression analysis to describe potential predictors for AKI. RESULTS: Median age was 80 years (IQR: 70-86). 58.8% of patients were males. The most common symptom on admission was fever (68.8%), followed by cough (57.7%). The majority of subjects presented with severe COVID-19 on admission (75.7%). During 28-day follow-up, 87 patients (32%) developed Stage 1 AKI, 17 subjects (6.3%) developed Stage 2 AKI and 12 patients (4.4%) developed Stage 3 AKI. AKI was more frequent (61 vs 24.3%) and more severe (Stage 2 AKI: 10.3 vs 2.2%; Stage 3 AKI: 6.6 vs 2.2%) among CKD patients. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, only disease severity and baseline eGFR were independent predictors for AKI in COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: CKD patients suffer AKI more frequently and of higher severity during COVID-19. Baseline eGFR, along with COVID-19 severity, are strong predictor factors of AKI in this setting.","output":"MO381 RISK FACTORS FOR AKI DURING COVID-19 AMONG NON-DIALYSIS CKD PATIENTS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current knowledge concerning the connection between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system in the male reproductive apparatus is still limited, so dedicated studies are urgently required Concerns about the male fertility consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection have started to emerge, since epidemiologic studies observed that this coronavirus affects male patients more frequently and with increased severity, possibly because of the hormone-regulated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor A disturbance in fertility is also expected based on studies of the previous SARS-CoV infection, which targets the same ACE2 receptor when entering the host cells In addition, bioinformatics analyses reveal the abundant expression of ACE2 receptor in the male reproductive tissues, particularly in the testis It has been proposed that pharmacological intervention favoring the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas receptor pathway and increasing ACE2 expression and activity could greatly prevent inflammatory lesions in this area Finally, in laboratories performing assisted reproductive technologies it is recommended that more attention should be paid not only to sperm quality but also to safety aspects Data about the potential infectivity of seminal fluid are in fact conflicting and do not exclude risks for both personnel and patients The potential infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in reproductive male tissues should be strongly considered and further investigated for the proper management of in vitro fertilization procedures","output":"Renin Angiotensin System, COVID-19 and Male Fertility: Any Risk for Conceiving?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. SETTING: Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of \\"cup feeding\\" is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. CONCLUSION: While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.","output":"Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) continues to be a health threat worldwide Increased blood lactate is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients;however, its association with outcomes in ICU COVID-19 patients remains currently unexplored In this retrospective, observational study we assessed whether lactate is associated with outcomes in COVID-19 patients Blood lactate was measured on ICU admission and thereafter daily up to day 14 in 45 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) was calculated on ICU admission, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was assessed on admission and every second day The cohort was divided into survivors and non-survivors based on 28-day ICU mortality (24 4%) Cox regression analysis revealed that maximum lactate on admission was independently related to 28-day ICU mortality with time in the presence of APACHE II (RR = 2 45, p = 0 008) Lactate&rsquo;s area under the curve for detecting 28-day ICU mortality was 0 77 (p = 0 008) Mixed model analysis showed that mean daily lactate levels were higher in non-survivors (p &lt;0 0001);the model applied on SOFA scores showed a similar time pattern Thus, initial blood lactate was an independent outcome predictor in COVID-19 ICU patients The time course of lactate mirrors organ dysfunction and is associated with poor clinical outcomes","output":"Lactate Kinetics Reflect Organ Dysfunction and Are Associated with Adverse Outcomes in Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: Preliminary Results from a GREEK Single-Centre Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Role distribution is a central issue for parents in the transition to parenthood, but little is known about the motivations in fathers to assume a specific role. Differences in work-family balance in each parent may be motivated by an individual choice mutually shared by both partners; however, in many couples, the parents may feel forced to adopt a traditional role distribution, either for financial reasons, or to comply with social expectations about what men and women should do when they are parents. This feeling of being socially constrained to adopt a role distribution that is not congruent with intrinsic motivations can generate dissatisfaction and may jeopardize the development of the interparental relationship. Coparenting refers to the emotional and instrumental support parents bring to each other in their parental tasks. It has been shown to be central in family functioning and a powerful predictor of childrens emotional and cognitive development. In this study, we aimed to assess the extent to which different motivations for role distribution in fathers are predictive of the quality of the coparental relationship. A convenience sample of 144 fathers from the French-speaking part of Switzerland completed online questionnaires about their motivations, coparental relationship, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results showed that the reasons for role distribution were mainly economical, practical, and in order to meet personal expectations. Multivariate general linear modeling showed that role distribution that is constrained to meet social expectations and age were predictive of a less cohesive coparental relationship, whereas a deliberate choice in role distribution was linked to a more cohesive coparental relationship.","output":"When Fathers Feel Socially Constrained to Assume a Role: A Negative Predictor of the Coparental Relationship in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, universities are going through a critical moment due to the coronavirus disease in 2019 To prevent its spread, countries have declared quarantines and isolation in all sectors of society This has caused many problems in the learning of students, since, when moving from a face-to-face educational model to a remote model, several academic factors such as psychological, financial, and methodological have been overlooked To exactly identify the variables and causes that affect learning, in this work a data analysis model using a Hadoop framework is proposed By processing the data, it is possible to identify and classify students to determine the problems they present in different learning activities The results are used by an artificial intelligence system that takes student information and converts it into knowledge, evaluates the academic performance problems they present, and determines what type of activity aligns with the students The artificial intelligence system processes the information and recommends activities that focus on each students abilities and needs The integration of these systems to universities creates an adaptive educational model that responds to the new challenges of society","output":"Academic Activities Recommendation System for Sustainable Education in the Age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Limited research has explored the relationship between weight bias and clinical attrition, despite weight bias being associated with negative health outcomes.

Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14,011 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent interactions between protein and ligand were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. This led to the identification of 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. Further, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complexes for the three top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, qingdainone, edgeworoside C and adlumidine, and of cathepsin L namely, ararobinol, (+)-oxoturkiyenine and 3&#945;,17&#945;-cinchophylline.

Material and Methods: Patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection (ACov-2), bacterial infection (ABI), healthy controls, and antiretroviral-controlled chronic HIV infection were assessed. Whole blood was stained and, after lysing no-wash protocol, acquired by flow cytometry. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD64 and CD169 was measured in granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes. The CD64 MFI ratio granulocytes to lymphocytes (CD64N) and CD169 MFI ratio monocytes to lymphocytes (CD169Mo) were evaluated as biomarkers of acute bacterial and viral infection, respectively. Results: A CD64N ratio higher than 3.3 identified patients with ABI with 83.3 and 85.9% sensitivity and specificity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 83.5%. In contrast, other analytic or hematological parameters used in the clinic had lower AUC compared with the CD64N ratio.

Since COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system and to a lesser degree the cardiovascular system, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of COVID-19-caused detraining on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) of recently recovered volleyball athletes. Sixteen experienced volleyball athletes (age 24  4.5 years) who were recently diagnosed and recovered from a COVID-19 infection volunteered to participate in this study and were tested for CRF and spirometry. Given that participants had only mild symptoms of infection, the primary focus of this study was on the effects of detraining on CRF. On average, the time to exhaustion was 9.4  1.4 min. VE, VCO(2), RER and oxygen pulse increased, heart rate exceeded 90% of predicted values, and peak VO(2) values were typical for this level of athlete (44.1  3.4 mL/kg). Pulmonary function reflected in FVC, FEV1/FVC and MVV values were well above 80% of predicted values for each of the participants while electrocardiography revealed no ischemia, arrythmias or conduction and repolarization abnormalities were found in the tested subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that participants experienced typical consequences of detraining. Due to a lack of CRF data prior to COVID-19 infection, we were unable to estimate the magnitude detraining had on CRF.

For the first time at great scale, Chinese college students had their educational activities moved online in spring 2020. Due to this unexpected isolation and unconventional learning method, their mental health following returning to school is worth investigating. METHODS: Between June 1 and June 15, 2020, a total of 8,921 returning college students' mental health status were assessed using instruments designed for psychiatric disorders, namely the 9-Item Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 6-Item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), Youth Self Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS), and self-developed questionnaire. RESULTS: Our results showed that 8.7%, 4.2%, 10.5%, and 6.1% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia, respectively, with a total of 19.8% reporting having at least one psychiatric symptom following their return to school. Sophomore and Senior year, and presence of previous psychiatric conditions contribute to the increased occurrence of psychiatric issues. The level of impact by COVID-19 on one's daily functioning is also positively associated with poor mental health.

During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 outbreak size in Italy based on international case exportations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The well-known SIR epidemic model is revisited.

The analysis relies on the experimental data of Simha and Rao [Universal trends in human cough airflows at large distances, Phys.

The analysis reveals a large probability of infection within the volume of the cough cloud and a rapid exponential decay beyond it. The benefit of using a mask is clearly brought out through a reduction in the probability of infection. The increase in the probability of transmission by a super-spreader is also quantified for the first time. At a distance of 1 m, the probability of infection from a super-spreader is found to be 185% larger than a normal person. Our results support the current recommendation of maintaining a 2 m distance between two people. The analysis is enough to be applied to the transmission of other diseases by coughing, while the probability of transmission of COVID-19 due to other respiratory events can be obtained using our proposed approach.","output":"Probability of COVID-19 infection by cough of a normal person and a super-spreader"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyzing and interpreting traumatic injuries is a fundamental aspect of routine forensic case work. As the human skeleton can be impacted through a combination of loading mechanisms and varying impact energies, the analysis and interpretation of skeletal trauma can be complex. Therefore, it is imperative that the reliability of techniques used for analysis are well-established. There is growing interest in machine learning (ML) in medicine (especially radiology) regarding the use of image classification (a subset of ML) to categorize and predict classes of medical images. Therefore, the feasibility of using image classification for skeletal trauma analysis should be explored for its benefits to forensic pathology and anthropology. The method explored in this paper examined the potential for machine learning, using three dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to assess whether morphological features of skeletal trauma to the femur can be used to differentiate between impact mechanisms within a forensic population. The objective of this study was to assess if morphological differences in femoral fractures seen in post-mortem-computed tomographic images (PMCT) could be categorized according to mechanism, specifically horizontal impacts resulting from pedestrian motor vehicle impacts (PMVIs) and vertical impact s resulting from high impact falls. Final model results indicated an accuracy between 69.95%-72.86% and 63.08%-66.24% validation. Although these results mean the method could not be practically used in its current form, as a proof of concept, there is potential for it to be developed as a tool to assist in classifying complex fracture states.","output":"Exploring the use of machine learning for the assessment of skeletal fracture morphology and differentiation between impact mechanisms: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning representations for dynamic graphs is fundamental as it supports numerous graph analytic tasks such as dynamic link prediction, node classification, and visualization. Real-world dynamic graphs are continuously evolved where new nodes and edges are introduced or removed during graph evolution. Most existing dynamic graph representation learning methods focus on modeling dynamic graphs with fixed nodes due to the complexity of modeling dynamic graphs, and therefore, cannot efficiently learn the evolutionary patterns of real-world evolving graphs. Moreover, existing methods generally model the structural information of evolving graphs separately from temporal information. This leads to the loss of important structural and temporal information that could cause the degradation of predictive performance of the model. By employing an innovative neural network architecture based on graph attention networks and temporal convolutions, our framework jointly learns graph representations contemplating evolving graph structure and temporal patterns. We propose a deep attention model to learn low-dimensional feature representations which preserves the graph structure and features among series of graph snapshots over time.

Therefore, we examined the influence of BRAFi/MEKi, either as single agent or in combination, on the maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and their interaction with T cells. DCs matured in the presence of vemurafenib or vemurafenib/cobimetinib altered their cytokine secretion and surface marker expression profile. Upon the antigen-specific stimulation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells with these DCs or with T2.A1 cells in the presence of BRAFi/MEKi, we detected a lower expression of activation markers on and a lower cytokine secretion by these T cells. However, treatment with any of the inhibitors alone or in combination did not change the avidity of CD8(+) T cells in peptide titration assays with T2.A1 cells. T-helper cell/DC interaction is a bi-directional process that normally results in DC activation. Vemurafenib and vemurafenib/cobimetinib completely abolished the helper T-cell-mediated upregulation of CD70, CD80, and CD86 but not CD25 on the DCs. The combination of dabrafenib/trametinib affected DC maturation and activation as well as T-cell activation less than combined vemurafenib/cobimetinib did.

Some studies assessing the effects of different preventive strategies have been published. However, there is no conclusive evidence. Therefore, this study aimed to review evidences related to COVID-19 prevention strategies achieved through contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation to determine best practices. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines by searching articles from major medical databases such as PubMed/Medline, Global Health Database, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. Non-randomized and modeling articles published to date in areas of COVID prevention with contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation were included. Two experts screened the articles and assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I tool and certainty of evidence with GRADE approach. The findings were presented narratively and in tabular form. RESULTS: We included 22 (9 observational and 13 modeling) studies. The studies consistently reported the benefit of quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation in different settings. Model estimates indicated that quarantine of exposed people averted 44 to 81% of incident cases and 31 to 63% of deaths. Quarantine along with others can also halve the reproductive number and reduce the incidence, thus, shortening the epidemic period effectively. Early initiation of quarantine, operating large-scale screenings, strong contact tracing systems, and isolation of cases can effectively reduce the epidemic. However, adhering only to screening and isolation with lower coverage can miss more than 75% of asymptomatic cases; hence, it is not effective. CONCLUSION: Quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation are effective measures of COVID-19 prevention, particularly when integrated together.

However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the severe COVID-19 phenotype. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform an locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify 4 introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. These variants likely drive the locus impact on severity by putatively modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes: CCR1 and CCR5.

However, concerns have been raised regarding facemask-associated dyspnea, thermal distress and self-reported impairment of cognition. Accordingly, we tested how facemask-use affects motor-cognitive performances of relevance for occupational safety. We hypothesized that mask use would affect cognitively dominated performances and thermal discomfort, but not alter whole-body thermal balance. Methods: Eight participants completed a facemask and a barefaced (control) trial, in a counterbalanced order, in 40C and 20% humidity conditions. Motor-cognitive performance, physiological (rectal, mean skin and local facial temperatures) and perceptual (thermal comfort and dyspnea) measures were assessed at baseline and following 45 min of light work (100 W). Results: Perceived dyspnea was aggravated with prolonged facemask use (p = 0.04), resulting in 36% greater breathlessness compared to control.

The research and development of new drugs require a lot of funding in addition to being a slow and costly process. As a result, new techniques have been proposed to streamline this process. The repositioning or repurposing of drugs represents an attractive strategy, presenting a promising way to introduce new drugs. Currently, numerous reused drugs are already available in the market and are in practice. In this review, it was observed that the antiviral drugs Entricitabine and Tenofovir display potential therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. Therefore, in silico analyses were considered a potential tool for predicting the effectiveness of drugs, mainly as an effective approach to encourage a complementary in vitro and in vivo antiviral evaluation.","output":"Potential repurposing of drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in preclinical trials: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2-infected bloodmeal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth & Jones) (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses.

To sensitise undergraduate medical students to the social and contextual determinants of health to achieve the health for all goal, these countries must focus on innovative teaching methods. The early introduction of a Community Orientation Program (COP) as a Community-based Medical Education (CBME) method could be a game changing strategy. In this paper the methods, evaluation, and implication of the COP in an Indian setting are described. METHODS: The curriculum of the COP was developed based on the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model for educational intervention. In this learner-centric and supervised educational program, the key aim was to focus on developing students communication skills, observation power and enhancing their motivation for learning through collaborative learning. To meet the objectives of the COP, a situated learning model under the constructivism theory was adopted. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, 557 students were trained through the COP by visiting more than 1300 households in ten villages. To supplement the students observations in the community, more than 150 small group discussions, a health education programme for the community and summary presentations were conducted. The students feedback indicated the need to improve the clinical examinations demonstration quality and increase the number of instruments for clinical examinations. More than 80% of students felt that the program would assist them to improve their communication skills, their understanding of the various socio-demographic factors associated with the common diseases, and it will enable them to respect the local culture during their clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of the COP as a CBME method in the undergraduate medical curriculum in an Indian setting has shown promising results. Further evidence is required to adopt such a program routinely for under-graduate medical teaching in the low- and middle- income settings.

However, there have been very few pediatric studies published during this period. Our goal is to review our results and evaluate the efficiency of thorascopy in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods The medical records of patients with PHC who were surgically treated between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. As all cysts larger than 5 cm in diameter were surgically removed, cysts less than 5 cm in diameter were medically treated and were not included in the study. Demographics, cyst characteristics, and operative/postoperative data were compared between patients who underwent thorascopy (thoracoscopy group) and patients who underwent thoracotomy (thoracotomy group). Chi-square and t-test were used for statistical analysis where appropriate. Results There were 26 consecutive children (14 girls, 12 boys; mean age 9.42.7) included in the study. Except for 2 incidentally diagnosed patients, all were symptomatic, 4 had multifocal lesions, and multiorgan involvement was detected in 11 patients. Thoracoscopy was performed in 10 patients, and conversion was necessary in 2 patients due to unsuccessful fistula ligation attempts. The thoracoscopy group included 8 thoracoscopically treated patients, and remaining patients constituted the thoracotomy group (n=18). Comparison of preoperative characteristics of the groups was insignificant, whereas the overall complication rate (residual bronchial fistula, prolonged air leak, pneumothorax, and localized air cyst) and median hospital stay were significantly higher in the thoracoscopy group. There was no mortality and no recurrence at the postoperative follow-up after 37.4 months. Conclusion The thoracoscopic approach to PHC may have a high risk of conversion and postoperative complication rate. Thoracotomy in children still seems to be the approach of choice for PHC larger than 5 cm. Routine thoracoscopic hydatid cyst treatment is yet far from being the gold standard, whereas thoracoscopy may be preferred in selected patients.","output":"Thoracoscopic Treatment of Pulmonary Hydatid Cysts May Have a High Morbidity Risk in Children: Retrospective Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed epidemics and pandemics of various infectious agents.

Complications cause personal suffering along with a significant economic burden on our healthcare system. However, the accurate prediction of postoperative complications and patient-targeted interventions for their prevention remain as major clinical challenges. RECENT FINDINGS Although multifactorial in origin, the dysregulation of immunological mechanisms that occur in response to surgical trauma is a key determinant of postoperative complications. Prior research, primarily focusing on inflammatory plasma markers, has provided important clues regarding their pathogenesis. However, the recent advent of high-content, single-cell transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies has considerably improved our ability to characterize the immune response to surgery, thereby providing new means to understand the immunological basis of postoperative complications and to identify prognostic biological signatures. SUMMARY The comprehensive and single-cell characterization of the human immune response to surgery has significantly advanced our ability to predict the risk of postoperative complications. Multiomic modeling of patients' immune states holds promise for the discovery of preoperative predictive biomarkers, ultimately providing patients and surgeons with actionable information to improve surgical outcomes. Although recent studies have generated a wealth of knowledge, laying the foundation for a single-cell atlas of the human immune response to surgery, larger-scale multiomic studies are required to derive robust, scalable, and sufficiently powerful models to accurately predict the risk of postoperative complications in individual patients.","output":"Measuring the human immune response to surgery: multiomics for the prediction of postoperative outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diseases with watery droppings (diarrhea and/or polyuria) can be considered some of the most severe health problems in domestic pigeons of various ages.

While this typology and terminology can be critiqued, it is rather clear that the virus and White supremacy are key concerns of social movements in various parts of the world, particularly in nation states that experienced European colonisation and imperialism. The wake of Covid-19 has perhaps brought greater attention and support to #BlackLivesMatter-oriented protest movements, including by those labelled people of colour (POC) or minorities in the North American context, such as Latinx and Asian communities. But with the amplified protest movement have come deeper calls for systemic change, from policy to ideology to everyday practice. Some of these critiques have been directed at the privilege, positionality, and participation of Asian communities not only with #BLM-oriented activism, but also in education and general society.

DESIGN: Between-subjects randomised experiment using a 2 (e-cigarette retail display visibility: high vs low)2 (proportion of e-cigarette images: 75% vs 25%) factorial design. SETTING: Online via the Qualtrics survey platform. PARTICIPANTS: UK children aged 13-17 years (n=1034), recruited through a research agency. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 12 images of retail displays that contained e-cigarette display images or unrelated product images. E-cigarette display images were either high or low visibility, based on a conspicuousness score. Participants were randomised to one of four groups, with e-cigarette display visibility and proportion of e-cigarette images, compared with images of unrelated products, manipulated: (1) 75% e-cigarettes, high visibility; (2) 25% e-cigarettes, high visibility; (3) 75% e-cigarettes, low visibility; (4) 25% e-cigarettes, low visibility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was susceptibility to smoking (among never smokers only). Secondary outcomes were susceptibility to using e-cigarettes (among never vapers only), and perceptions of smoking and e-cigarette harm (all participants). RESULTS: Neither e-cigarette retail display visibility, nor the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed, appeared to influence susceptibility to smoking (visibility: OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.13, p=0.24; proportion: OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.82, p=0.054 (reference: low visibility, not susceptible)).Planned subgroup analyses indicated that exposure to a higher proportion of e-cigarette images increased susceptibility to smoking among children who visited retail stores more regularly (n=524, OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.43, p=0.034), and those who passed the attention check (n=880, OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.031).In addition, neither e-cigarette retail display visibility nor the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed, appeared to influence susceptibility to using e-cigarettes (visibility: OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43, p=0.65; proportion: OR=1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64, p=0.18).Greater visibility of e-cigarette retail displays reduced perceived harm of smoking (mean difference (MD)=-0.19, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.04, p=0.016). There was no evidence that the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed had an effect (MD=-0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.09, p=0.40).Perceived harm of e-cigarette use did not appear to be affected by e-cigarette retail display visibility (MD=-0.12, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.05, p=0.16) or by the proportion of e-cigarette images displayed (MD=-0.10, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.07, p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence in the full sample to suggest that children's susceptibility to smoking is increased by exposure to higher visibility e-cigarette retail displays, or to a higher proportion of e-cigarette images. However, for regular store visitors or those paying more attention, viewing a higher proportion of e-cigarette images increased susceptibility to smoking. In addition, viewing higher visibility e-cigarette images reduced perceived harm of smoking.

Neurotropic demyelinating strain of MHV (MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strain RSA59) induces MS-like disease in mice mediated by microglia, along with a small population of T cells. The mechanism of demyelination is at least in part due to microglia-mediated myelin stripping, with some direct axonal injury. Immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mainly CD4(+) T-cell-mediated disease, although CD8(+) T cells may play a significant role in demyelination. It is possible that both autoimmune and nonimmune mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity may induce MS. Our study directly compares CNS pathology in autoimmune and viral-induced MS models. Mice with viral-induced and EAE demyelinating diseases demonstrated similar patterns and distributions of demyelination that accumulated over the course of the disease. However, significant differences in acute inflammation were noted. Inflammation was restricted mainly to white matter at all times in EAE, whereas inflammation initially largely involved gray matter in acute MHV-induced disease and then is subsequently localized only in white matter in the chronic disease phase.

Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described. RESULTS: The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively.

SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RNA, IL\\\\ 6 and caspase 3 were minimally expressed and confined to mononuclear inflammatory cells. The biopsies from livedo/retiform purpura showed pauci\\\\inflammatory vascular thrombosis without any MXA decoration. Blood vessels exhibited extensive complement deposition with endothelial cell localization of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 protein, IL6, and caspase 3; SARS CoV\\\\2 RNA was not seen. CONCLUSION: The COVID\\\\19\\\\associated perniosis represents an exaggerated immune reaction to a virus with significant type\\\\I interferon signaling important to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 eradication and has implications in regards to a more generalized highly\\\\inflammatory response. We hypothesize that in the thrombotic retiform purpura of critically ill patients with COVID\\\\19, the vascular thrombosis in the skin and other organ systems is associated with a minimal interferon response allowing excessive viral replication with release of viral proteins that localize to extrapulmonary endothelium and trigger extensive complement activation.","output":"The differing pathophysiologies that underlie COVID\\\\19 associated perniosis and thrombotic retiform purpura: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fifth health sector directors policy and planning meeting for the World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Africa convened to focus on building health system resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure continuity of essential health services, primary health care (PHC) revitalization, and health system strengthening towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC).

In this context, we studied the spatial transmission of COVID-19 vectors in an indoor setting representative of a typical office room. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to study the airborne dispersion of particles ejected due to different respiratory mechanisms, i.e., coughing, sneezing, normal talking, and loud talking. Number concentration profiles at a distance of 2 m in front of the emitter at the ventilation rates of 4, 6, and 8 air changes per hour (ACH) were estimated for different combinations of inletCoutlet positions and emitterCreceptor configurations. Apart from respiratory events, viz., coughing and sneezing characterized by higher velocity and concentration of ejected particles, normal as well as loud talking was seen to be carrying particles to the receptor for some airflow patterns in the room. This study indicates that the rule of thumb based safe distance approach cannot be a general mitigation strategy for infection control. Under some scenarios, events with a lower release rate of droplets such as talking (i.e., asymptomatic transmission) can lead to a high concentration of particles persisting for long times. For better removal, the study suggests air curtains as an appropriate approach, simultaneously highlighting the pitfalls in the higher ventilation rate for better removal strategy. The inferences for talking-induced particle transmissions are crucial considering that large populations of COVID-19-infected persons are projected to be asymptomatic transmitters.","output":"CFD Simulation of the Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 Vectors Emitted during Respiratory Mechanisms: Revisiting the Concept of Safe Distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced a significant health burden worldwide, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for publications that reported the relationship of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension and myocardial injury with in-hospital fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The ORs were extracted and pooled. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis, including eight studies for CVD, seven for hypertension and eight for acute cardiac injury.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of anastomotic leakage (AL, n = 28; no-AL, n = 565); clinicopathological and surgical characteristics were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The AL group patients had a higher comorbidity rate (96.4% vs. 66.9%, p < 0.001), higher CCI score (p < 0.001), higher blood loss (42 mL vs. 23 mL, p = 0.046), and longer hospital stay (30 days vs. 12 days, p < 0.001) than the no-AL group patients.

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. METHODS: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R(0)), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R(t), with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. RESULTS: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R(t) < 1) in about a month. CONCLUSION: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020. Moreover, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two epidemiological/demographic indices to evaluate the state of activity of the epidemic, potentially helping in challenging decisions to continue, ease, or tighten restrictions.

The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to exceed 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity exceeds 3.21-fold. In 2nd and 3rd scenarios according to the calculations made by considering the social compliance rates of the NPIs, the value of R0 is estimated to decrease from 3 to 1.38 level. Compliance with NPIs makes a 94,303 difference in the expected number of deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey healthcare capacity. While this study conducted, curfew for >65 and <20 age groups were in force in Turkey. If the curfew is declared for the 21-64 age population (4th scenario), the R0 value drops below 1 (0.98), the expected deaths are 14,230 and the peak values of daily ICU and non-ICU bed demand are below the healthcare capacity. Discussion: Modeling epidemics with assumptions supported by scientific literature and establishing decision support systems based on objective criteria is an important requirement. According to scientific data for the population of Turkey, the situation is not expected to be of worse than predictions presented in the second dimension. Predictions show that 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 100,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken. Complete control of the pandemic is possible by keeping R0 below 1. For this, additional evidence-based measures are needed.","output":"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 and Healthcare Demand In Turkey, A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of rapid and convenient means of transportation, millions of persons travel each year from industrialized to developing countries in the tropics and subtropics. These travelers are at risk for a variety of infectious diseases that are endemic in these areas; the most frequently occurring of these is diarrhea. Studies of groups of travelers to Latin America and Africa have found that approximately one-half develop diarrhea during their stay abroad. Etiologic investigations of these illnesses have demonstrated that the important agents that cause travelers' diarrhea are similar to those that cause diarrhea in children in the developing countries. One-third of the cases are associated with enterotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli. Smaller proportions appear to be due to rotavirus, Norwalk virus, Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica.

Study design: National cross sectional community survey. Setting: Australian general public. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362). Main outcome measures: Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and socio-demographic factors. Results: People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p<0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59% vs 72%; p<0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. They were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5, p<0.001) and reported more difficulty remembering/accessing medication since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7, p<0.001). Importantly there was higher endorsement of misinformation beliefs related to COVID-19 and vaccination in people with lower health literacy. Similar results were observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. Conclusion: Our findings show important disparities by health literacy and language in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.

METHODS We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. RESULTS The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p < 0.01). LSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p < 0.05). There were no significant relationships between LSA and EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and between EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION The policies promoted to address the state of emergency in Japan might affect life-space mobility and QoL of CAD patients. Moreover, CAD patients in Japan who were not obese and maintained their physical function and activity tended to refrain from activity during the period between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency.

These conditions can be treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the complement component C5 and prevent formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). While MAC is involved in uncontrolled lysis of erythrocytes in these patients, it is also required for serum bactericidal activity (SBA), i.e. clearance of encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, terminal complement blockage in these patients increases the risk of invasive disease by Neisseria meningitidis more than 1000-fold compared to the general population, despite obligatory vaccination. It is assumed that alternative instead of terminal pathway inhibition reduces the risk of meningococcal disease in vaccinated individuals. To address this, we investigated the SBA with alternative pathway inhibitors. Serum was collected from adults before and after vaccination with a meningococcal serogroup A, C, W, Y capsule conjugate vaccine and tested for meningococcal killing in the presence of factor B and D, C3, C5 and MASP-2 inhibitors. B meningococci were not included in this study since the immune response against protein-based vaccines is more complex. Unsurprisingly, inhibition of C5 abrogated killing of meningococci by all sera. In contrast, both factor B and D inhibitors affected meningococcal killing in sera from individuals with low, but not with high bactericidal anti-capsular titers. While the anti-MASP-2 mAb did not impair SBA, inhibition of C3 impeded meningococcal killing in most, but not in all sera. These data provide evidence that vaccination can provide protection against invasive meningococcal disease in patients treated with alternative pathway inhibitors.","output":"Alternative Complement Pathway Inhibition Does Not Abrogate Meningococcal Killing by Serum of Vaccinated Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Informed consent is an essential prerequisite for enrolling patients into a study. Obtaining informed consent in an emergency is complex and often impossible. Delayed consent has been suggested for emergency care research. This study aims to determine the acceptability of prehospital emergency care research with delayed consent in the Western Cape community of South Africa. METHODS: This study was an online survey of a stratified, representative sample of community members in the Western Cape province of South Africa. We calculated a powered sample size to be 385, and a stratified sampling method was employed. The survey was based on similar studies and piloted. Data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 807 surveys were returned. Most respondents felt that enrolment into prehospital research would be acceptable if it offered direct benefit to them (n = 455; 68%) or if their condition was life-threatening and the research would identify improved treatment for future patients with a similar condition (n = 474; 70%). Similar results were appreciable when asked about the participation of their family member (n = 445; 66%) or their child (n = 422; 62%) regarding direct prospects of benefit. Overwhelmingly, respondents indicated that they would prefer to be informed of their own (n = 590; 85%), their family members (n = 593; 84%) or their childs (n = 587; 86%) participation in a study immediately or as soon as possible. Only 35% (n = 283) agreed to retention data of deceased patients without the next of kins consent. CONCLUSION: We report majority agreement of respondents for emergency care research with delayed consent if the interventions offered direct benefit to the research participant, if the participants condition was life-threatening and the work held the prospect of benefit for future patients, and if the protocol for delayed consent was approved by a human research ethics committee.

The final sample included 58 children in North Carolina who completed fear learning before Hurricane Florencea potentially traumatic event. After the hurricane, we assessed severity of hurricane impact and PTSD symptoms. We found that threat responsivity as measured by differential SCR during fear learning before the hurricane predicted PTSD hyperarousal symptoms and that hurricane impact predicted PTSD symptoms following the disaster.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Enrolled patients with initial symptoms within 12 days were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200 mg*3/day) or favipiravir (1600 mg*2/first day followed by 600 mg*2/day) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for pyrexia and cough, respiratory frequency 24 times/min; oxygen saturation 98%). Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results: A total of 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were assigned to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: ?0.03050.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, p < 0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p > 0.05). The most frequently observed favipiravir-associated adverse event was increased serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Among patients with COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7.

Studies on therapeutic administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ALI caused by the viral infection have been limited in number and have shown conflicting results. The aim of the present investigation is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSC administration in A/H5N1-caused ALI, using a mouse model. METHODS: MSCs were prepared from the bone marrow of 9 to 12 week-old BALB/c mice. An H5N1 virus of A/turkey/East Java/Av154/2013 was intranasally inoculated into BALB/c mice. On days 2, 4, and 6 after virus inoculation, MSCs were intravenously administered into the mice. To evaluate effects of the treatment, we examined for lung alveolar protein as an indicator for lung injury, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for lung functioning, and lung histopathology. Expressions of NF-B, RAGE (transmembrane receptor for damage associated molecular patterns), TNF, IL-1, Sftpc (alveolar cell type II marker), and Aqp5+ (alveolar cell type I marker) were examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, body weight, virus growth in lung and brain, and duration of survival were measured. RESULTS: The administration of MSCs lowered the level of lung damage in the virus-infected mice, as shown by measuring lung alveolar protein, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and histopathological score. In the MSC-treated group, the expressions of NF-B, RAGE, TNF, and IL-1 were significantly suppressed in comparison with a mock-treated group, while those of Sftpc and Aqp5+ were enhanced. Body weight, virus growth, and survival period were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of MSCs prevented further lung injury and inflammation, and enhanced alveolar cell type II and I regeneration, while it did not significantly affect viral proliferation and mouse morbidity and mortality. The results suggested that MSC administration was a promissing strategy for treatment of acute lung injuries caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus, although further optimization and combination use of anti-viral drugs will be obviously required to achieve the goal of reducing mortality.","output":"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells attenuate pulmonary inflammation and lung damage caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus in BALB/c mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a multifaceted rapid response by the scientific community, bringing researchers, health officials, and industry together to address the ongoing public health emergency.

A structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were conducted to examine all the considered research hypotheses. The results show that risk perception significantly affects perceived understanding and social distancing behaviors in a positive way. Perceived understanding has a significant positive correlation with social distancing behaviors and plays a mediating role in the relationship between risk perception and social distancing behaviors. Furthermore, safety climate positively predicts social distancing behaviors but lessens the positive correlation between risk perception and social distancing.

FES is an under-diagnosed syndrome for the inaccuracy of definition and the lack of diagnostic criteria. Eyelid laxity can result from a number of involutional, local, and systemic diseases. Thus, it is pivotal to use the right terminology. When the increased distractibility of the upper or lower eyelid is an isolated condition, it is defined as 'lax eyelid condition' (LAC). When laxity is associated with ocular surface disorder such as papillary conjunctivitis and dry eyes, it can be referred to as 'lax eyelid syndrome' (LES). However, FES is characterized by the finding of a very loose upper eyelid which everts very easily and papillary tarsal conjunctivitis affecting a specific population of patients, typically male, of middle age and overweight. Obesity in middle-aged male is also recognized as the strongest risk factor in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, (OSAHS). FES has been reported as the most frequent ocular disorder associated with OSAHS. Patients with FES often complain of non-pathognomonic ocular signs and symptoms such as pain, foreign body sensation, redness, photophobia, and lacrimation.

We use a survey among 730 persons living in Germany at the start of the official vaccination program. We elicit willingness to vaccinate first in a standard form, and then again after clarifications and after providing additional information. We find that a substantial number of persons who state initially that they do not want to get vaccinated does so simply because they want to let people with higher risk be vaccinated first. Appropriately rephrasing the question increases the willingness by around 5 percentage points. Information about herd immunity increases the willingness by additional 7%, confirming previous findings. Standard survey-based estimates of vaccination willingness might underestimate the real number of persons who want to get a vaccination. This number can be increased even further by simply providing appropriate information on herd immunity. In our sample this increased vaccination willingness from 71.4% to 83.6%. ? 2021 Medknow.

India enacted such measures early on for effective mitigation and suppression to reduce community transmission, including an onerous national lockdown. The impact of the health system governance is quite apparent among all stakeholders including the public in such emergency contexts. METHODS: We compiled the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries and deaths from January 30th until June 16th, 2020. Different stages were categorized from post PHEIC declaration (pre-lockdown) phase to lockdown phases and unlocking phase as implemented. The several measures adopted by the national government were structured in four broad categories as Governance and socioeconomic, travel restrictions, lockdown and public health measures. These measures were compared during each phase. RESULTS: It was revealed that while the cases are rising the phased restrictions has helped in delaying the peak and remarkably interrupted the rate of transmission. The national average doubling rate was 3 days at the beginning which improved to 22 days. The basic reproduction number remained close to 1 during the last week of lockdown. However, the initial interruption of needed aid and technical support had negative social and economic impacts on the affected population. CONCLUSIONS: As the situation abates following the measures adopted by the government, an articulate strategy of unlocking through increased testing and prompt isolation needs to be developed for more effective reduction and protecting the livelihoods allowing to further relax the lockdown measures. KEY MESSAGES: There is need for the local government to consider a strategic easing of the lockdown for protecting the rights of the most affected population. As the transmission rates are low, the easing of lockdown can be benefited from improved testing and prompt isolation.","output":"Impact of lockdown measures in abating the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons from Indias phased approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Lauteur revient avec force, humour et parfois indignation sur les pisodes marquants de la pandmie au Covid 19 qui rappellent, pour lui, certains pisodes de la dr?le de guerre puis du blitzkrieg dont Marc Bloch avait tir de forts enseignements dans un ouvrage rest clbre.

In case of ARDS and critical severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is recommended when other respiratory support strategies (oxygen insufflation, non-invasive ventilation [NIV], invasive ventilation through an endotracheal tube) are insufficient. However, available data on ECMO in pregnant and postpartum women with critical COVID-19 are very limited. METHODS: A case series of three critically ill pregnant women who required ECMO support for COVID-19 in pregnancy and/or in the postpartum period. RESULTS: The first patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the second trimester, she developed ARDS and required ECMO for 38 days. She was discharged in good general conditions and a cesarean-section [CS] at term was performed for obstetric indication. The second patient developed COVID-19-related ARDS at 28 weeks of gestation. During ECMO, she experienced a precipitous vaginal delivery at 31 weeks and 6 days of gestation. She was discharged 1 month later in good general conditions. The third patient, an obese 43-year-old woman, tested positive at 38 weeks and 2 days of gestation. Because of the worsening of clinical condition, a CS was performed, and she underwent ECMO. 143 days after the CS, she died because of sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF). Thrombosis, hemorrhage and infections were the main complications among our patients. Neonatal outcomes have been positive.

Beside their well-known role in wound healing and hemostasis, they are emerging mediators of the immune response and implicated in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including cancer. Despite their anucleate nature, they harbor a diverse set of RNAs, which are subject to an active sorting mechanism from megakaryocytes into proplatelets and affect platelet biogenesis and function. However, sorting mechanisms are poorly understood, but RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been suggested to play a crucial role. Moreover, RBPs may regulate RNA translation and decay following platelet activation. In concert with other regulators, including microRNAs, long non-coding and circular RNAs, RBPs control multiple steps of the platelet life cycle. In this review, we will highlight the different RNA species within platelets and their impact on megakaryopoiesis, platelet biogenesis and platelet function. Additionally, we will focus on the currently known concepts of post-transcriptional control mechanisms important for RNA fate within platelets with a special emphasis on RBPs.","output":"Post-Transcriptional Expression Control in Platelet Biogenesis and Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED; Medtronic) has been used off-label for the treatment of challenging posterior circulation aneurysms. Data on this modality are primarily limited to small retrospective single-center series. OBJECTIVE To assess safety and efficacy of this treatment by establishing an international, multicenter collaboration. METHODS Consecutive posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the PED from 2012 to 2019 across 11 neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographics, aneurysm and treatment characteristics, complications, occlusion status, and functional outcome were assessed. RESULTS There were 149 posterior circulation aneurysms treated with PED in 146 patients. A total of 24 (16.4%) patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most aneurysms were dissecting/blister (36.2%) in morphology, followed by saccular (35.6%) and fusiform (28.2%). The most common locations were the vertebral (51.7%) and basilar arteries (22.8%). Complete or near-complete occlusion (>90%) was achieved in 90.9% of aneurysms at a median follow-up of 12 mo. Dissecting/blister aneurysms were most likely to occlude (P = .06). Symptomatic neurologic complications occurred in 9.4% of aneurysms, associated with larger size, ruptured presentation, presentations with brain stem compression, cranial nerve palsy, or stroke. Favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-2) was achieved in 86.2% of patients. There were 6 fatalities of which 4 occurred in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSION This multicenter study shows that PED for the treatment of posterior circulation is preferentially used for the treatment of fusiform and dissecting/blister aneurysm morphologies. Despite the challenges presented by these less-common morphologies, flow diversion may be performed with a neurologic complication rate of about 10% and favorable long-term aneurysm occlusion rates.","output":"Experience With the Pipeline Embolization Device for Posterior Circulations Aneurysms: A Multicenter Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States. Whereas racial and ethnic disparities in severe COVID-19-associated outcomes, including mortality, have been documented (1-3), less is known about population-based disparities in infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, although persons aged <30 years account for approximately one third of reported infections, there is limited information on racial and ethnic disparities in infection among young persons over time and by sex and age. Based on 689,672 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC's case-based surveillance system by jurisdictional health departments, racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence among persons aged <25 years in 16 U.S. jurisdictions? were described by age group and sex and across three periods during January 1-December 31, 2020. During January-April, COVID-19 incidence was substantially higher among most racial and ethnic minority groups compared with that among non-Hispanic White (White) persons (rate ratio [RR] range = 1.09-4.62). During May-August, the RR increased from 2.49 to 4.57 among non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NH/PI) persons but decreased among other racial and ethnic minority groups (RR range = 0.52-2.82). Decreases in disparities were observed during September-December (RR range = 0.37-1.69); these decreases were largely because of a greater increase in incidence among White persons, rather than a decline in incidence among racial and ethnic minority groups. NH/PI, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons experienced the largest persistent disparities over the entire period. Ensuring equitable and timely access to preventive measures, including testing, safe work and education settings, and vaccination when eligible is important to address racial/ethnic disparities.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Incidence by Age, Sex, and Period Among Persons Aged <25 Years - 16 U.S. Jurisdictions, January 1-December 31, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This conversation reflects on the importance of transnational Black solidarity in a global moment where the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed structural inequalities that sustain Black death and the global movement for Black lives has focussed attention on anti-Blackness We reflect on the legacies of past and contemporary Black, Indigenous, People of Colour activism and the role that this has played in strengthening transnational efforts to deal with colonialism, imperialism and patriarchy In highlighting how anti-Blackness is sustained across different institutions - from the academy to social movements, we centre Black feminist movements? role in building radical visions of equitable and transformative worlds through a focus on the nexus between patriarchy, capitalism and white supremacy Black feminist visions we argue are geared at disrupting and transforming current power structures to advance justice and create liberatory futures A central part of these liberatory futures lies in building collective power that is rooted in the political values of solidarity, hope and joy","output":"Global movement for Black lives: A conversation between Awino Okech and Shereen Essof"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A real-time RT-PCR assay based on the TaqMan technology was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of pestiviruses infecting cattle, i.e., bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) 1, BVDV-2, and the emerging HoBi-like pestiviruses.

Body cavity effusions develop in a subset of patients with advanced disease. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be present in certain body fluids (eg, blood) of COVID patients, it remains unclear if body cavity fluids are sites of infection. Our aim was to characterize the cytologic and clinical findings in COVID-19 patients with effusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A record search for all cases of body cavity effusion cytology in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from March 1, 2020, to September 1, 2020, was performed. Clinical history, fluid chemical analysis, cytologic findings, and patient outcomes were recorded. All cytology slides were reviewed. In situ hybridization (ISH) targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein transcript (V-nCoV2019-S) was performed on cell block material in all cases. RESULTS: A total of 17 effusion cytology cases were identified among 15 COVID patients, including 13 pleural, 2 pericardial, and 2 peritoneal. Most (13 of 15) patients were hospitalized for COVID complications. Eight patients died during hospitalization, 7 from COVID complications. All fluids were transudative by protein criteria. Lymphocytic or histiocytic inflammation predominated in 12 of 17 cases. Five exhibited hemophagocytosis. No viral cytopathic changes or extra-medullary megakaryocytes were seen. Viral RNA was not detected in any case by ISH. CONCLUSIONS: Body cavity effusion is an ominous finding in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease. Such effusions tend to be transudative with lymphohistiocytic inflammation, and commonly exhibit hemophagocytosis, an otherwise rare finding in effusion cytologies.

Emulating such natural systems into drone swarms to solve problems in defence, agriculture, industry automation and humanitarian relief is an emerging technology. However, flocking of aerial robots while maintaining multiple objectives, like collision avoidance, high speed etc. is still a challenge. In this paper, optimized flocking of drones in a confined environment with multiple conflicting objectives is proposed. The considered objectives are collision avoidance (with each other and the wall), speed, correlation, and communication (connected and disconnected agents). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for dimensionality reduction, and understanding the collective dynamics of the swarm. The control model is characterised by 12 parameters which are then optimized using a multi-objective solver (NSGA-II). The obtained results are reported and compared with that of the CMA-ES algorithm.

To elucidate the rate, reason, and predictors of readmissions in neurosurgical patients, we analyzed unscheduled readmissions to our neurosurgical department after treatment for cranial or cerebral lesions. METHODS From 2015 to 2017, all adult patients who had been discharged from our Department of Neurosurgery and were readmitted within 30 days were included into the study cohort. The patients were divided into a surgical and a non-surgical group. The main outcome measure was unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS During the observation period, 183 (7.4%) of 2486 patients had to be readmitted unexpectedly within 30 days after discharge. The main readmission causes were surgical site infection (34.4 %) and seizure (16.4%) in the surgical group, compared to natural progression of the original diagnosis (38.2%) in the non-surgical group. Most important predictors for an unplanned readmission were younger age, presence of malignoma (OR: 2.44), and presence of cardiovascular side diagnoses in the surgical group. In the non-surgical group, predictors were length of stay (OR: 1.07) and the need for intensive care (OR: 5.79). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that reasons for readmission vary between operated and non-operated patients and are preventable in large numbers. In addition, we identified treatment-related partly modifiable factors as predictors of unplanned readmission in the non-surgical group, while unmodifiable patient-related factors predominated in the surgical group. Further patient-related risk adjustment models are needed to establish an individualized preventive strategy in order to reduce unplanned readmissions.","output":"Early unplanned readmission of neurosurgical patients after treatment of intracranial lesions: a comparison between surgical and non-surgical intervention group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ocular deformation may be associated with biomechanical alterations in the structures of the eye, especially the cornea and sclera in conditions such as keratoconus, congenital glaucoma, and pathological myopia.

The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of respiratory viruses in wheezing children who were not older than 24 months of age and who had no history of asthma. METHODS Fifty-five Mexican children were included in an analytical cross-sectional study. Nasal secretions were obtained by using sterile rayon-tipped applicators to identify the virus by polymerase chain reaction or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction: adenovirus, bocavirus, human rhinovirus, influenza virus type A, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The prevalence of viral etiology was estimated by dividing the frequency of the identified virus by the number of participants. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for proportions were calculated. RESULTS Most of the patients were male (35/55, 63.6%). The average time of evolution of wheezing episode was 3 days. The third part of enrolled population were receiving antibiotics. Respiratory viruses were detected in 33 (60%; 95% CI: 46.8-71.9%) out of 55 cases, and viral coinfection was detected in five cases (9.1%; 95% CI: 3.5-19.9%). Human metapneumovirus was the most frequently identified virus (23.6%), followed by bocavirus (14.5%), respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus (12.7% each), and to a lesser extent influenza virus type A and parainfluenza. Rhinovirus was the predominant virus in outpatient children (28.6%). In the inpatient emergency room and inhalotherapy room, human metapneumovirus predominated (41.2 and 16.1%, respectively).

The prevalence and predictors of these symptoms, termed postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; PASC), have not been fully described. METHODS: Participants discharged from an outpatient telemedicine program for COVID-19 were emailed a survey (1C6 months after discharge) about ongoing symptoms, acute illness severity, and quality of life. Standardized telemedicine notes from acute illness were used for covariates (comorbidities and provider-assessed symptom severity). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to assess predictors of persistent symptoms. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety patients completed the survey, of whom 115 (39.7%) reported persistent symptoms including fatigue (n = 59, 20.3%), dyspnea on exertion (n = 41, 14.1%), and mental fog (n = 39, 13.5%), among others. The proportion of persistent symptoms did not differ based on duration since illness (<90 days: n = 32, 37.2%; vs >90 days: n = 80, 40.4%; P = .61).

We sought to determine if adding capnography to standard monitoring during sedation of children increased the frequency of interventions for hypoventilation, and whether these interventions would decrease the frequency of oxygen desaturations. METHODS We enrolled 154 children receiving procedural sedation in a pediatric emergency department. All subjects received standard monitoring and capnography, but were randomized to whether staff could view the capnography monitor (intervention) or were blinded to it (controls). Primary outcome were the rate of interventions provided by staff for hypoventilation and the rate of oxygen desaturation less than 95%. RESULTS Seventy-seven children were randomized to each group. Forty-five percent had at least 1 episode of hypoventilation. The rate of hypoventilation per minute was significantly higher among controls (7.1% vs 1.0%, P = .008). There were significantly fewer interventions in the intervention group than in the control group (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.50). Interventions were more likely to occur contemporaneously with hypoventilation in the intervention group (2.26; 95% CI, 1.34-3.81). Interventions not in time with hypoventilation were associated with higher odds of oxygen desaturation less than 95% (odds ratio, 5.31; 95% CI, 2.76-10.22). CONCLUSION Hypoventilation is common during sedation of pediatric emergency department patients. This can be difficult to detect by current monitoring methods other than capnography.

At the same time expert replies are embedded in the media context and the pandemic reality is directly linked to a wider range of pressing social issues intensively discussed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Biopolitical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic: public discussion about freedom and transformation of social life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of cities has brought tremendous pressure to astronomical observation, energy security, and the ecosystem. Automatic monitoring of night sky brightness (NSB) can help us to understand its regional differences and time variations of NSB effectively and to investigate the human and natural factors which lead to these changes. In this paper, the construction of Wuxi City night sky brightness monitoring network (WBMN) in China is presented. In addition to introducing the equipment and the installation of the network, a brief analysis of the data obtained from the stations will also be presented. The impact of human activities on the NSB is illustrated through its changes during the Spring Festival (lunar new year) and non-festival nights, and through a comparison study between NSB data taken from locations of different land usages. It is concluded that, while the reduction in human activities after non-festival midnights or the reduction in moon illumination near the new moon epoch led to darker night skies, brightening of the night skies may be attributed to firework displays during the nights of Spring Festival in 2019. On the other hand, the absence of firework during the Spring Festival in 2020 may explain the darker night skies. Finally, there is an evidence that the urban developments in Wuxi are degrading night sky quality.","output":"Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network in Wuxi, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes a patient with thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) with aplastic anemia in pharmacological remission and COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure in the course of the disease and reviews the published literature on this topic. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of the eight patients with MG including our patient suggests two possible mechanisms for respiratory failure: myasthenic crisis (MC) or pulmonary complications of COVID-19. Patients with MC were young women in high-grade MGFA Class whereas patients with respiratory failure due to pulmonary complications of COVID-19 were elderly men in pharmacological remission or MGFA Class I. These observations suggest that COVID-19, like other infections, may precipitate MC in patients with severe grade MG before COVID-19. The only differentiating feature between the two types of failure was severity myasthenic weakness. This clinical distinction has management implications.

METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted an online survey of 19 carceral systems that provided methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment for incarcerated populations before COVID-19. Eleven survey items examined challenges and changes to these programs as a result of the pandemic. Sixteen of 19 programs (84%) responded to the survey. RESULTS: Ten out of 16 systems reported downsizing their OAT programs. Seven of 16 systems made changes to medication dispensation processes. Half of systems report challenges implementing physical distancing (na=a8), and/or obtaining personal protective equipment (na=a8). In 13 out of 16 systems some OAT program participants were released early due to COVID-19 infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Jails and prisons with existing OAT programs have curtailed their operations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the robust evidence base around OAT for treating opioid use disorder and averting overdose deaths, guidance is needed on maintaining and ramping up medication access as carceral facilities grapple with implementing COVID-19 mitigation.","output":"Early Effects of COVID-19 on Programs Providing Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Jails and Prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, first year students in particular have seemed even more lonely, sad and stressed than usual without a network of friends and social activities to support them (1) These concerns are often expressed during online personal tutoring, individual supervision and one-to-one meetings There do, however, appear to be some unanticipated positives to mentoring students online Meetings are easy to arrange, and travel and room bookings are unnecessary, allowing faculty to meet with students more frequently to respond more quickly to a worried student's email requesting a meeting (2)","output":"\\"Excuse the cat\\" Reflections on online mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The most effective chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in previously untreated CLL is the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Ibrutinib (I), the first irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase approved for CLL, has improved outcomes in numerous clinical trials compared to different CIT. Methods: FLAIR (ISRCTN01844152) is an ongoing, phase III, multicentre, randomised, controlled, open, parallel group trial for previously untreated CLL requiring therapy according to the IWCLL 2008 guidelines. Patients over 75 years or with >20% 17p-deleted cells were excluded. Participants were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive 6 cycles of FCR (oral fludarabine 24mg/m 2/day for 5 days, oral cyclophosphamide 150mg/m 2/day for 5 days with IV rituximab [375 mg/m 2 on day 1/2 of cycle 1;500 mg/m 2 on day 1 of cycles 2-6]) every 28-days or IR (Ibrutinib [420mg/day] plus rituximab [6 doses as for FCR]) given for up to 6 years with stratification by disease stage, age, gender and centre. The primary endpoint was to assess whether IR was superior to FCR in terms of investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included overall survival,;attainment of undetectable MRD;response to therapy;safety and toxicity;health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. A formal interim analysis was planned when 191 events were observed in both arms or 109 events in the FCR arm alone with a p-value of 0.005 leading to reporting of the trial. Here we report the results of this planned interim analysis. Results: A total of 771 patients were randomised (385 to FCR and 386 to IR) from 113 UK Centres between 9/19/2014 and 7/19/2018. The data was locked on 5/24/2021. 73.3% were male, median age was 62 years (33.6% >65yo) and 45.1% were Binet Stage C. IGHV data was available for 728 (94.4%) patients with 53.2% IGHV unmutated (98% homology to germline), 40.5% IGHV mutated and 6.3% Subset 2. Hierarchical FISH testing revealed 0.4% 17p del, 15.4% 11q del, 12.3% trisomy 12, 29.7% normal and 35% 13q del;with 7.1% failed. The arms were well-balanced for disease variables with no significance differences. Median follow-up was 52.7 months. IR had a superior PFS compared to FCR (Median PFS not reached for IR versus 67 months for FCR;HR: 0.44;p<0.001;see Figure). The PFS was significantly better for IR in patients with IGHV unmutated CLL (HR: 0.41;p<0.001), but not for patients with IGHV mutated CLL at this follow-up (HR: 0.66;p=0.179). There was no difference in overall survival between the two arms (HR: 1.01;p=0.956) with a total of 29 deaths in FCR arm (including 4 from CLL, 3 Richter's [RT], 3 AML/MDS, 3 COVID-19 and 2 cardiac/sudden) and 30 in the IR arm (including 3 CLL, 1 RT, 0 AML/MDS, 3 COVID-19 and 8 cardiac/sudden). Second line treatment was initiated for 59 patients after FCR (including 38 BTKi, 7 venetoclax+R [venR], 4 BendamustineR [BR] and 3 CHOP-R [RT]) and 21 after IR (including 7 FCR, 5 venR, 1 BR, 1 CHOP-R [RT], 1 ABVD [Hodgkin's]). Overall, 88.1% of patients have received targeted therapies for CLL progression after FCR. The overall survival with FCR in FLAIR is significantly improved compared to FCR in previous NCRI trials (ADMIRE and ARCTIC) which had the same inclusion criteria, the same Centres and an identical FCR schedule, but were conducted prior to widespread availability of targeted therapies in the relapse (recruited between 2009 and 2012). The 4 year overall survival for FCR in FLAIR was 94.5% compared to 84.2% for FCR between 2009 and 2012. SAEs were reported in 53.7% of patients on FCR and 53.4% on IR. Notable differences for SAEs by organ class for FCR vs IR: infections in 33.6% of patients vs 27.1%;blood and lymphatic in 19.8% vs 10.7%;and cardiac in 1.1% vs 8.3%. With current follow-up, there were 10 sudden or cardiac deaths: 8 IR and 2 FCR. Further analysis indicated that 7 of the 8 cardiac or sudden deaths in the IR arm had a history of hypertension or cardiac disease (further detailed in additional ;Munir et al.). Neither of the sudden deaths in the FCR arm ad a prior cardiac or hypertensive history or were on cardiac or anti-hypertensive treatment. There were 6 cases of secondary MDS/AML in the FCR arm and 1 in the IR arm. Conclusion: Ibrutinib plus rituximab resulted in a superior PFS compared to FCR. There was no difference in overall survival, most likely due to effective second-line targeted therapy in patients progressing after FCR.

It is shown, under the assumption that the correlations are affine in nature, such network of nodal interactions is equivalent to a network with added agents, represented by nodes that are latent, where no corresponding time-series measurements are available; however, here all exogenous excitements are spatially (that is, across agents) uncorrelated. Generalizing affine correlations, it is shown that, under polynomial correlations, the latent nodes in the expanded networks can be excited by clusters of noise sources, where the clusters are uncorrelated with each other. The clusters can be replaced with a single noise source if the latent nodes are allowed to have non-linear interactions. Finally, using the sparse plus low-rank matrix decomposition of the imaginary part of the inverse power spectral density matrix (IPSDM) of the time-series data, the topology of the network is reconstructed.

However, no individual-level study has confirmed the association to date. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati hospitals and clinics and estimated particulate matter 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) exposure over a 10-year period (2008-2017) at their residential zip codes. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between PM(2.5) exposure and hospitalizations for COVID-19, adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the 1,128 patients included in our study, the mean (standard deviation) PM(2.5) was 11.34 (0.70) g/m(3) for the 10-year average exposure and 13.83 (1.03) g/m(3) for the 10-year maximal exposures. The association between long-term PM(2.5) exposure and hospitalization for COVID-19 was contingent upon having pre-existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) (P(interaction)=0.030 for average PM(2.5) and P(interaction)=0.001 for maximal PM(2.5)). In COVID-19 patients with asthma or COPD, the odds of hospitalization were 62% higher with 1 g/m(3) increment in 10-year average PM(2.5) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-2.64) and 65% higher with 1 g/m(3) increase in 10-year maximal PM(2.5) levels (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16-2.35). However, among COVID-19 patients without asthma or COPD, PM(2.5) exposure was not associated with higher hospitalizations (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.65-1.09 for average PM(2.5) and OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.95 for maximal PM(2.5)).

Traditional Chest X-ray detection requires professional medical personnel, which is time-consuming and laborious. Accurate medical segmentation can be used as an auxiliary means to detect COVID-19, which not only greatly reduces the cost and time, but also greatly improves the applicability. With the rapid development of deep learning, a network model based on U-NET has been proposed and widely used in medical image segmentation in recent years. However, in U-NET network, multiple convolutional pooling operations cause the loss of image spatial information features, and each channel of output features is treated equally, thus lacking flexibility in processing different information. Therefore, in this paper, we add gray bars to the samples to avoid the distortion and feature reduction caused by clipping and resize. the U-NET model architecture is taken as the main body to improve the weight of each channel in the U-NET encoding layer to increase the semantic information of the feature map and improve the segmentation accuracy of the network. In the decoding channel, feature information is restored by up-sampling. Finally, convolution and Softmax function are used to obtain the predictive segmentation image with the same size as the original image.

In these cases, crises like epidemics may be viewed as opportunities to spark structural changes that will improve future prevention efforts. However, crises can also weaken governance and reinforce systemic failures. In this paper, we use the concept of the governance treadmill to demonstrate cross-level dynamics that help or hinder the alignment of capacities toward prevention during public health crises. We find that variation in capacities and responses across local, national, and international levels contributes to the complex evolution of global and local health governance. Where capacities are misaligned, effective local prevention of global pandemic impacts tends to be elusive in the short term, and multiple cycles of crisis and response may be required before capacities align toward healthy governance.

In this study, we applied salmon host transcriptional biomarkers to identify and select fish in a viral disease state, but only those that were negative for known viruses based on RT-PCR screening. These fish were selected for metatranscriptomic sequencing to discover potential viral pathogens of dead and dying farmed Atlantic (Salmo salar) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in British Columbia (BC). We found that the application of the biomarker panel increased the probability of discovering viruses in aquaculture populations. We discovered two viruses that have not previously been characterised in Atlantic salmon farms in BC (Atlantic salmon calicivirus and Cutthroat trout virus-2), as well as partially sequenced three putative novel viruses. To determine the epidemiology of the newly discovered or emerging viruses, we conducted high-throughput reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and screened over 9,000 farmed and wild salmon sampled over one decade. Atlantic salmon calicivirus and Cutthroat trout virus-2 were in more than half of the farmed Atlantic salmon we tested.

Current margin assessment techniques are slow and labour intensive. Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) rapidly identifies dissected tissues by determination of tissue structural lipid profiles through on-line chemical analysis of electrosurgical aerosol toward real-time margin assessment. METHODS Electrosurgical aerosol produced from ex-vivo and in-vivo breast samples was aspirated into a mass spectrometer (MS) using a monopolar hand-piece. Tissue identification results obtained by multivariate statistical analysis of MS data were validated by histopathology. Ex-vivo classification models were constructed from a mass spectral database of normal and tumour breast samples. Univariate and tandem MS analysis of significant peaks was conducted to identify biochemical differences between normal and cancerous tissues. An ex-vivo classification model was used in combination with bespoke recognition software, as an intelligent knife (iKnife), to predict the diagnosis for an ex-vivo validation set. Intraoperative REIMS data were acquired during breast surgery and time-synchronized to operative videos. RESULTS A classification model using histologically validated spectral data acquired from 932 sampling points in normal tissue and 226 in tumour tissue provided 93.4% sensitivity and 94.9% specificity. Tandem MS identified 63 phospholipids and 6 triglyceride species responsible for 24 spectral differences between tissue types. iKnife recognition accuracy with 260 newly acquired fresh and frozen breast tissue specimens (normal n = 161, tumour n = 99) provided sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 98.8%. The ex-vivo and intra-operative method produced visually comparable high intensity spectra. iKnife interpretation of intra-operative electrosurgical vapours, including data acquisition and analysis was possible within a mean of 1.80 seconds (SD 0.40). CONCLUSIONS The REIMS method has been optimised for real-time iKnife analysis of heterogeneous breast tissues based on subtle changes in lipid metabolism, and the results suggest spectral analysis is both accurate and rapid. Proof-of-concept data demonstrate the iKnife method is capable of online intraoperative data collection and analysis. Further validation studies are required to determine the accuracy of intra-operative REIMS for oncological margin assessment.","output":"Rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry of electrosurgical vapours for the identification of breast pathology: towards an intelligent knife for breast cancer surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has seen tele-therapy become 'the only way' for all of us, but the author has been using it since 2004 in her parent infant work. While she acknowledges and enumerates some of the frustrations inherent in tele-therapy, associated with its deviation from the classical psychoanalytic method, she also poses several questions: does it broaden the scope of psychoanalysis? Is it consistent with Freud's 'hope' that 'the increasing experience' of psychoanalysts will include adaptations on behalf of patients, for instance those who cannot attend sessions in person? [Freud, S. (1912). Recommendations to physicians practising psycho-analysis, section (f). SE, XII, p. 120]. Also, are there aspects of tele-therapy that actually aid rather than hinder the aims, for example, the lessening of inhibition in virtual space? In the discussion, the author focuses on the screen as the defining aspect of tele-therapy. The screen becomes an intermediary point in the therapistCclient interaction and relationship, which facilitates new aspects of mental functioning. These new aspects can include assimilating facial expressions (Darwin, 1872), the construction of a virtual space that activates internal objects, the speed needed to handle face-to-face psychoanalytic dialogue, and the surprise felt when internal obstacles or trauma are repositioned, lessened or neutralised in tele-therapy sessions where clients don't expect their repressed unconscious conflicts to be noticed. In conclusion, the author puts forward a notion that tele-therapy can foster a 'virtual space that becomes real', in other words, a virtual experience that can become an emotionally-felt reality.

Besides the use of the prodrug remdesivir itself, the direct administration of GS-441 524, the resulting main metabolite of remdesivir, could be advantageous and even more effective. All substances were not originally developed for the treatment of COVID-19 and especially for GS-441 524 little is known about its pharmacokinetic and physical-chemical properties. To justify the application of new or repurposed drugs in humans, pre-clinical in vivo animal models are mandatory to investigate relevant PK and PD properties and their relationship to each other. In this study, an adapted mouse model was chosen to demonstrate its suitability to provide sufficient information on the model substances GS-441 524 and HCQ regarding plasma concentration and distribution into relevant tissues a prerequisite for treatment effectiveness. Methods GS-441 524 and HCQ were administered intravenously as a single injection to male mice. Blood and organ samples were taken at several time points and drug concentrations were quantified in plasma and tissue homogenates by two liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry methods. In vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the degradation of remdesivir in human plasma and blood. All pharmacokinetic analyses were performed with R Studio using non-compartmental analysis. Results High tissue to plasma ratios for GS-441 524 and HCQ were found, indicating a significant distribution into the examined tissue, except for the central nervous system and fat. For GS-441 524, measured tissue concentrations exceeded the reported in vitro EC50 values by more than 10-fold and in consideration of its high efficacy against feline infectious peritonitis, GS-441 524 could indeed be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. For HCQ, relatively high in vitro EC50 values are reported, which were not reached in all tissues. Facing its slow tissue distribution, HCQ might not lead to sufficient tissue saturation for a reliable antiviral effect. Conclusion The mouse model was able to characterise the PK and tissue distribution of both model substances and is a suitable tool to investigate early drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we could demonstrate a high tissue distribution of GS-441 524 even if not administered as the prodrug remdesivir.","output":"Tissue Level Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals in mice to predict their effects: comparing Remdesivirs active metabolite GS-441 524 vs. the clinically failed Hydroxychloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal-containing enzymes (metallonanozymes) are of therapeutic importance to treat various diseases.

By June 2021, the mortality from such infections approached 3.9 million people. Despite the availability of a number of vaccines which provide protection against this virus, the evolution of new viral variants, inconsistent availability of the vaccine around the world, and vaccine hesitancy, in some countries, makes it unreasonable to rely on mass vaccination alone to combat this pandemic.

The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. Cardiovascular events can be preventable when high-risk populations are targeted, for example, through population-wide screening strategies. When available resources are limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high-risk groups. Targeting of high-risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources are not spent on the entire population. Early detection in the form of screening for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high-risk groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it and can help contain health-related costs, for example, those associated with hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and comorbidities. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. SEARCH METHODS: An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS-Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from inception until 9 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs (NRCTs), that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of all retrieved studies was done in Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full-text screening if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias using pre-specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta-analysis of sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results. MAIN RESULTS: We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 potentially eligible studies for full-text screening. However, no studies met the eligibility criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is an implicit assumption that early detection of hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. High-quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality is lacking.","output":"Screening strategies for hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection.

Data on COVID-19+ HCW were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. RESULTS: Among 16,912 HCW tested, 10.6% tested positive. Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths.

This paper examines this issue from a historical perspective by analyzing the dividend decisions of a sample of central-reserve-city banks during the Great Depression and its aftermath to 1973, and in particular the active risk management role that dividend policy may have played for study banks. Dividend policy was used to balance the interests of stockholders and depositors, and to preserve the long-term solvency of the bank. Overall our study results show that despite an initial reluctance to cut dividends, banks cut dividend levels by 24% in 1932 and by 12.7% in 1933 (in median terms). Post-Great Depression dividends remained at depressed levels through most of the 1930s and 1940s. Our study results indicate that this period of depressed and relatively constant dividends allowed banks to rebuild capital levels, which had fallen sharply with the Great Depression. Capital rebuilding post-depression represented risk-shifting in favor of depositors and likely contributed to the stability of the U.S. banking system in the post-depression era.","output":"Should Bank Dividends Be Regulated?

Patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without prior bariatric surgery. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity, intubation rate, hemodialysis rate, and length of stay (LOS). As the database only provides aggregate data, and not patient-level data, multivariate analysis could not be performed. RESULTS: Among the 124,699 patients with obesity admitted with COVID-19, 2,607 had previous bariatric surgery and 122,092 did not. The proportion of patients >65-years-old was higher in the non-bariatric surgery group (36.0% vs. 27.6%, p<0.0001). Compared to patients without prior bariatric surgery, patients with prior bariatric surgery had lower in-hospital mortality (7.8 vs. 11.2%, p<0.0001) and intubation rates (18.5% vs. 23.6%, p=0.0009).

These interventions may lead to hypercapnia, barotrauma, and haemodynamic failure in the event of an obstructed upper airway. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and the haemodynamic effects of the Ventrain, a manually operated ventilation device that provides expiratory ventilation assistance. Transtracheal ventilation was carried out with the Ventrain in different airway scenarios in live pigs, and its performance was compared with a conventional jet ventilator. METHODS Pigs with open, partly obstructed, or completely closed upper airways were transtracheally ventilated either with the Ventrain or by conventional jet ventilation. Airway pressures, haemodynamic parameters, and blood gases obtained in the different settings were compared. RESULTS Mean (SD) alveolar minute ventilation as reflected by arterial partial pressure of CO2 was superior with the Ventrain in partly obstructed airways after 6 min in comparison with traditional manual jet ventilation [4.7 (0.19) compared with 7.1 (0.37) kPa], and this was also the case in all simulated airway conditions. At the same time, peak airway pressures were significantly lower and haemodynamic parameters were altered to a lesser extent with the Ventrain. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that the Ventrain device can ensure sufficient oxygenation and ventilation through a small-bore transtracheal catheter when the airway is open, partly obstructed, or completely closed.

Here, we have described potential novel therapeutic options based on the structure and pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as the results of previous studies on similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. Many of these approaches can be used for controlling viral infection by reducing the viral damage or by increasing the potency of the host response. Owing to their high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, siRNAs, aptamers, nanobodies, neutralizing antibodies, and different types of peptides can be used for interference with viral replication or for blocking internalization. Receptor agonists and interferon-inducing agents are also potential options to balance and enhance the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Solid evidence on the efficacy and safety of such novel technologies is yet to be established although many well-designed clinical trials are underway to address these issues.","output":"Emerging Technologies for the Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a stress test for the finance educators around the world.

We examined the relationship between telecommuting frequency and unhealthy dietary habits among Japanese workers. METHODS: A total of 33,302 workers completed an Internet survey about telecommuting and dietary habits. Data from 13,468 office workers who telecommuted were analyzed. Telecommuting frequency during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic was extracted from a questionnaire. The odds ratios (ORs) of four types of dietary habits, namely, skipping breakfast, solitary eating, lower meal frequency, and meal substitution associated with telecommuting frequency were estimated using multilevel logistic regression nested in the prefecture of residence to control for differences in residential area. RESULTS: The multivariate OR of skipping breakfast was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.03C1.29, p = .013) for participants who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. Similarly, the OR of solitary eating, lower meal frequency and meal substitution were 1.44 (95% CI: 1.28C1.63, p < .001), 2.39 (95% CI: 1.66C3.44, p < .001), and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.04C1.51, p = .015) for those who telecommuted in excess of four days per week compared to those who rarely telecommuted. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose\\\\response trend in ORs of solitary eating (p for trend <.001), lower meal frequency (p for trend <.001), and meal substitution (p for trend = .001) with increasing telecommuting frequency.

Material and methods. Examination and treatment were carried out in the infectious-tuberculosis departments of the Botkin Clinical Infectious Disease Hospital. We examined 63 patients identified in the first seven months of the epidemic in the multimillion city of St. Petersburg (Russia). Tuberculosis, confirmed by conventional bacteriological and molecular genetic methods, had an active phase in all of them. The new coronavirus infection was verified by a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. Results. Tuberculosis in 43 patients was detected simultaneously with COVID-19, in 20 people it preceded coronavirus infection. Disseminated forms of tuberculosis prevailed - 50.8%;in 36.5%, two or more organs and systems were affected, which is associated with a high proportion (54.0%) of HIV-positive patients with an advanced stage of the disease. Lung damage with COVID-19 was noted in 36.5%. Fatal outcomes ended in 20.6% of cases of coinfection, the structure of the causes of death is given. Conclusion. An assumption was made about the possibility of an aggravating effect of tuberculosis on COVID-19 in the case of severe or widespread forms of these diseases. The negative influence of HIV infection on the outcome of the disease has also been shown.

To achieve this goal, the surface chemistry of silica nanoparticles of 20 nm diameter was tailored via plasma polymerization with amine, carboxylic acid, oxazolines, and alkane functionalities. The results of this study show significant surface chemistry-induced differences in protein corona composition, which reflect in the subsequent inflammatory consequences. Nanoparticles rich with carboxylic acid surface functionalities increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to higher level of complement proteins and decreased the number of lipoproteins found in their protein coronas. On another hand, amine rich coatings led to increased expressions of anti-inflammatory markers such as arginase.

METHODS: For model development and validation, a total number of 694 cases with 111,066 CT slides were retrospectively collected as training data and independent test data in the study. Among them, 118 are confirmed COVID-19 infected pneumonia cases and 576 are other pulmonary infections cases (e.g. tuberculosis cases, common pneumonia cases and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia cases). The cases were divided into training and testing datasets. The independent test was performed by evaluating and comparing the performance of three radiologists with different years of practice experience in distinguishing COVID-19 infected pneumonia cases with and without the AI assistance. RESULTS: Our final model achieved an overall test accuracy of 0.914 with an area of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.903 in which the sensitivity and specificity are 0.918 and 0.909, respectively.

We therefore performed a prospective cohort study of women undergoing pure transvaginal appendectomies (TVA) versus traditional laparoscopic appendectomies (LA). Using a validated, 19-point, female sexual function index questionnaire (FSFI) assessing six domains of sexual function (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain with intercourse), pre- and postoperative sexual function was compared. METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2010, 42 patients with acute appendicitis were offered a pure TVA. Patients who did not wish to undergo a TVA underwent an LA and served as controls. Both groups were provided with an FSFI before surgery and at regular intervals for up to 1 year. Pre- and postoperative FSFI results were compared between cohorts using unpaired t tests, and between individuals within each cohort pre- and postoperatively using paired t tests. RESULTS Twenty-two underwent LA, 18 patients underwent a pure TVA, and 2 refused participation in this study. Preoperative and >60 days postoperative FSFI data were available for 21 patients (10 LA and 11 TVA). Baseline FSFI scores were not significantly different between groups (LA, 19.3  0.9; TVA, 19.3  0.8, p = 0.99). FSFI scores at greater than 60 days postoperatively did not differ significantly from FSFI scores preoperatively in either group (LA, 19.3  0.9 to 19.7  0.7; p = 0.87; TVA, 19.3  0.8 to 19.4  0.9; p = 0.97). No FSFI domain in either cohort was significantly changed postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Neither LA nor TVA affected female sexual function scores. This suggests that TVA does not have negative effects on female sexual function.

Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021. Albeit, whether these mutations exist as the cause or the effect of co-infections and/or co-morbid disorders within COVID-19 patients is still unclear. Moreover, most of the current vaccine and therapeutic interventions are revolving around spike protein. However, emphasizing on envelope protein's (1) conserved epitopes, (2) pathogenicity attenuating mutations, and (3) mutations present in the deceased patients, as reported in our present study, new directions to the ongoing efforts of therapeutic developments against COVID-19 can be achieved by targeting envelope viroporin.","output":"Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 envelope viroporin mutations from COVID-19 deceased and surviving patients revealed implications on its ion-channel activities and correlation with patient mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis associated with coronavirus disease 2019 is broad, ranging from fever and cutaneous eruptions to respiratory distress or even neurological disorders.

Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. AIMS: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the Secret Garden 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection. Three hundred sixtyCdegree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The Secret Garden video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals. METHODS: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the surgical mask of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearers respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions.","output":"COVID Feel GoodAn Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Interpersonal violence is an ongoing, vexing public health issue.

Control of odors is also socially important and believed to be a societal measure of cleanliness. Understanding the need for good cleaning and disinfecting is even more important today considering the potential spread of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus. While the flush toilet was a major advancement in achieving these objectives, exposure to pathogens can occur from failure to clean and disinfectant areas within a restroom, as well as poor hand hygiene. The build-up of biofilm within a toilet bowl/urinal including sink can result in the persistence of pathogens and odors. During flushing, pathogens can be ejected from the toilet bowl/urinal/sink and be transmitted by inhalation and contaminated fomites. Use of automatic toilet bowl cleaners can reduce the number of microorganisms ejected during a flush. Salmonella bacteria can colonize the underside of the rim of toilets and persist up to 50 days. Pathogenic enteric bacteria appear in greater numbers in the biofilm found in toilets than in the water. Source tracking of bacteria in homes has demonstrated that during cleaning enteric bacteria are transferred from the toilet to the bathroom sinks and that these same bacteria colonize cleaning tools used in the restroom. Quantitative microbial risk assessment has shown that significant risks exist from both aerosols and fomites in restrooms. Cleaning with soaps and detergents without the use of disinfectants in public restrooms may spread bacteria and viruses throughout the restroom. Odors in restrooms are largely controlled by ventilation and flushing volume in toilet/urinals. However, this results in increased energy and water usage.

This information is necessary for government and philanthropic agencies to tailor mental health supports, services, and resources for veterans in the peri- and post-pandemic periods. The objective of this study was to compare mental health symptoms between Canadian Armed Forces (CAFs) veterans and the general Canadian older adult population in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of older adults in the national Canadian COVID-19 Coping Study. Individuals aged 55 years and older were eligible. A convenience sample of older adults was recruited through a web-based survey administered between May 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Canadian Armed Force military service history status (yes/no) was ascertained. The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item Loneliness Scale were used to measure mental health symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression compared the odds of screening positive for depression, anxiety, and loneliness between veterans and non-veterans. RESULTS: Of 1,541 respondents who answered the final question (87% survey completeness rate), 210 were veterans. Forty percent of veterans met criteria for at least one of the mental health diagnoses compared to 46% of non-veterans (P = .12). The odds of reporting elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were similar for veteran and non-veteran respondents after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: Veterans report of mental health symptoms was similar to the general population Spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey looked at comfort and experience with FAVDs and vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries (VAVD) throughout their post-graduate training. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. Respondents were compared by post-graduate year (PGY) and region. RESULTS: One hundred six MFM fellows (32%) completed the survey. 22.6% of MFM fellows had performed greater than 30 FAVDs, with 33% having performed &#8804;10 FAVDs. In comparison, 35.8% of fellows had performed more than 30 VAVDs. While 95.2% of fellows feel prepared to perform a VAVD independently, only 59.4% feel prepared to do FAVDs independently.

Therefore, a nature-based rehabilitation programme was tailored specific to men with mental health problems, and long-term illnesses. The rehabilitation programme combines the use of nature, body, mind, and community spirit (NBMC) and is called the Wildman Programme. The presented study was designed as a matched-control study with an intervention group participating in the Wildman Programme (N = 114) compared to a control group receiving treatment as usual (N = 39). Outcomes were measured at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6 months post-intervention (T3). The primary outcome was the participants quality of life measured by WHOQOL-BREF, which consists of four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The secondary outcomes were the level of stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the participants emotional experience in relation to nature, measured by the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). The intervention group improved significantly in the physical and psychological WHOQOL-BREF domains and in PSS at both follow-ups. The participants interest in using nature for restoration increased significantly as well. The only detectable difference between the control group and the intervention group was in the WHOQOL-BREF physical domain at the 6-month follow-up.

Newer platforms need to be technically less demanding, require minimum equipment and reduce turn-around time for reporting results. The objective of this study was to exploit loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate its performance by comparison with rRT-PCR. Methods: Reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay primers were designed to detect envelop (E) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2. Positive control RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription of E and N genes clones. RT-LAMP amplification reactions were incubated at 65C for 30 min. Results were recorded visually. RT-LAMP results were evaluated by comparing the results obtained with a commercial rRT-PCR kit. Results: The RT-LAMP assay for E and N genes was carried out in separate tubes. RT-LAMP detected about 40 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per reaction. A total of 253 throat swabs were tested using the RT-LAMP assay. The overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assay were 98.46 and 100 per cent, respectively, as compared to the rRT-PCR.

However, insertion of a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope causes discomfort in patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the reliability of short-time exposure images obtained using 320-row area detector computed tomography (320-ADCT) as a novel evaluation method for the assessment of velopharyngeal function. METHODS We evaluated five healthy adult volunteers and five postoperative adult patients with cleft palate. During a 3.3-s imaging exposure, the participants were asked to perform two tasks: nasal inspiration and subsequent oral expiration through a catheter into a water-filled cup. The movement of the velopharyngeal structures was recorded during each examination, and the presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) and velopharyngeal closure (VPC) patterns were estimated. If VPI was detected, the cross-sectional area was also calculated. Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa coefficients were used to evaluate the concordance of nasopharyngoscopy and 320-ADCT evaluation. RESULTS Speech pathology evaluation did not reveal hypernasality in any study participant. Micro-VPI was detected by nasopharyngoscopy in one healthy volunteer and two patients. 320-ADCT detected micro-VPI in two more patients. The cross-sectional area of the VPI in these subjects ranged from 2.53 to 16.28 mm2. Nasopharyngoscopy and 320-ADCT were concordant in detecting VPI in eight participants ( = 0.6) and in assessing VPC patterns in nine ( = 0.82). Moreover, images obtained using 320-ADCT allowed for reduced dead angle and, thus, easy detection of micro-VPI and Passavant's ridges. CONCLUSION Although the radiation exposure cannot be ignored, our novel evaluation method using 320-ADCT enables more detailed evaluation of VPC than nasopharyngoscopy. Future studies should investigate the relationship between 320-ADCT findings and speech pathology evaluations.","output":"Velopharyngeal closure analysis using four-dimensional computed tomography: a pilot study of healthy volunteers and adult patients with cleft palate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evaluation of sky characteristics plays a fundamental role for many astrophysical experiments and ground-based observations.

This article aims to (1) highlight the challenges of running behavioral clinical trials during the pandemic, (2) suggest approaches to maximize generalizability of pandemic-era studies, and (3) offer strategies for successful behavioral trials beyond the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Thousands of clinical trials have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, from undergoing protocol revisions to suspension altogether. Furthermore, for ongoing trials, recruitment of diverse populations has suffered, thereby exacerbating existing inequities in clinical research. Patient adherence and retention have been affected by a myriad of pandemic-era restraints, and medical, psychiatric, and other complications from the pandemic have the potential to have long-term effects on pandemic-era study results.

The large surface area and GB-rich nature of the polycrystalline 1L WS2 film enabled the immobilization of bioreceptors in high surface density with spatial uniformity, while the AuNPs perform not only as bioreceptor linkers, but also promote detection sensitivity through surface plasmon resonance enhancement effect. Therefore, the presented biosensor demonstrated highly sensitive and selective sub-femto-molar detection of representative RNA sequences from the novel coronavirus (RdRp, ORF1ad and E).

While no major evidence of vaccine hesitancy was observed, we found a WTP of about Rs. 141 ($1.9) for the former type vaccine and about Rs. 116 ($1.6) for the latter. From the contingent valuation method, we found about 71.9% were not willing to spend Rs. 200 ($2.7) or more for the fully effective vaccine, while this figure goes up to 77.8% for the one with 70% efficacy. Estimations from linear and probit regressions suggest that economic indicators were the most important predictors of WTP. Usage of public transport, the number of days that the respondent stepped out for work, and the presence of comorbid individuals in the household were positively associated with the WTP, while pandemic-induced income reduction was negatively correlated.

There is widespread belief that small aneurysms < 7 mm do not rupture. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the size of ruptured aneurysms according to aneurysm locations and methods of size estimation. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We included articles that reported mean aneurysm size in consecutive series of ruptured intracranial. We excluded studies limited to a specific aneurysm location or type. The random-effects model was used to calculate overall mean size and location-specific mean size. We performed meta-regression to explain observed heterogeneity and variation in reported size. RESULTS The systematic review included 36 studies and 12,609 ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Overall mean aneurysm size was 7.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI 6.2-7.4]). Pooled mean size varied with location. Overall mean size of 2145 ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms was 6.0 mm (95% CI 5.6-6.4, residual I2 = 86%). Overall mean size of 743 ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms was 6.2 mm (95% CI 5.3-7.0, residual I2 = 93%). Meta-regression identified aneurysm location and definition of size (i.e., maximum dimension vs. aneurysm height) as significant determinants of aneurysm size reported in the studies.

All procedures were performed by or under the direct guidance of a single surgeon. Patients' ages ranged from 1 day to 18 years, and weights ranged from 2.8 to 78 kg. Preoperative diagnosis included sequestration/congenital pulmonary airway malformation (n=306), severe bronchiectasis (n=24), congenital lobar emphysema (n=13), and malignancy (n=4). RESULTS Of the 347 procedures, 342 were completed thoracoscopically. Operative times ranged from 35 minutes to 240 minutes (average, 115 minutes). Average operative time when a trainee was the primary surgeon was 160 minutes. There were 81 upper, 25 middle, and 241 lower lobe resections. There were four intraoperative complications (1.1%) requiring conversion to an open thoracotomy. The postoperative complication rate was 3.3%, and 3 patients required re-exploration for a prolonged air leak. Hospital length of stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 16 days (average).

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related unemployment and healthcare utilisation in a sample of older adults across 27 European countries. METHODS: We used data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe COVID-19 Survey, collected between June and August 2020. Participants (n=52 061) reported whether they lost a job, forwent medical treatment and whether their appointment was postponed due to COVID-19. Three-level models were estimated for each outcome to test the effects of individual, household and country-level characteristics. RESULTS: The mean prevalence of reported job loss, and forgone and postponed medical care was 19%, 12% and 26%, respectively. Job loss was associated with female sex, lower education and household income, and older age in women. For example, the OR of job loss, comparing primary versus tertiary (college) education, was 1.89 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.26).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included.

Physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise were recruited to provide care to patients with COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies on their experiences of combating COVID-19 have been published. We aimed to describe the experiences of these health-care providers in the early stages of the outbreak. Methods We did a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Nurses and physicians were recruited from five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Hubei province using purposive and snowball sampling. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone from Feb 10 to Feb 15, 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Haase's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological method. Findings We recruited nine nurses and four physicians. Three theme categories emerged from data analysis. The first was being fully responsible for patients' wellbeingthis is my duty. Health-care providers volunteered and tried their best to provide care for patients. Nurses had a crucial role in providing intensive care and assisting with activities of daily living. The second category was challenges of working on COVID-19 wards. Health-care providers were challenged by working in a totally new context, exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions, and managing relationships in this stressful situation. The third category was resilience amid challenges. Health-care providers identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies to cope with the situation. They also achieved transcendence from this unique experience. Interpretation The intensive work drained health-care providers physically and emotionally. Health-care providers showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Comprehensive support should be provided to safeguard the wellbeing of health-care providers. Regular and intensive training for all health-care providers is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in crisis management.

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases. DESIGN: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, 2010C2020. SETTING: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: People registered in primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 clinically diagnosed in primary care. ANALYSES: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010C2011 to 2019C2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019C2020 season were used to model expected case numbers with Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models, overall and stratified by age. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. RESULTS: Four influenza season curves (2011C2012, 2012C2013, 2013C2014 and 2016C2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019C2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020, 8017 (95% CI: 1841 to 14 718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15C64 age group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. The use of clinical codes could misrepresent the true occurrence of the disease. Serological or PCR testing should be used to confirm these findings. In future, this surveillance of excess influenza could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like pathogens, to initiate early public health responses.","output":"Excess cases of influenza and the coronavirus epidemic in Catalonia: a time-series analysis of primary-care electronic medical records covering over 6 million people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has been currently spread all over the world with high mortality reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Many severe COVID-19 patients exacerbated from mild illness several days after hospital admissions. Pathophysiological evolution within this para-exacerbation period remain unclear. Methods: Twenty-two confirmed COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one exacerbation were included. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between the records of hospital admission day and the exacerbation day. Dynamic profiles of critical parameters were explored during the para-exacerbation period. Results: Most of the patients were elder (67, IQR63-79), male (81.8%), coexisted with comorbidities (72.7%), multi-segments radiologically involved and exacerbated from mild to severe illness with anoxia at a median interval of 4 days (IQR, 2-7) from hospital admissions. On exacerbations, various clinical parameters were worsened, including respiratory rate, PaO2/FiO2 rate (PFR), alveolar-arterial PO2 difference (A-aDO 2 ), hematological cellularities, biochemical parameters and radiological abnormalities. Dynamic profiles showed that neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and serum level of lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase and coagulation parameters started to increase even at four days before the exacerbation. Conclusions: Anoxia due to impaired gas exchange progress pathophysiologically characterized the exacerbation of COVID-19 patients. Continuously monitoring crucial clinical parameters, such as NLR, serum albumin, LDH, lactic acid, and CT involvement scale will be helpful to improve the recognition of the disease progression in patients with COVID-19 at early stage.

In addition, this study analyzed the tongue features of convalescent patients from clinical tongue qualitative values, including thick and thin, fur, peeling, fat and lean, tooth marks and cracked, and greasy and putrid fur. RESULTS: We included 2164 tongue images in total (34% from day 0, 35.4% from day 14 and 30.6% from day 28) from convalescent patients. The significance results are shown as follows. Firstly, as the recovery time prolongs, the L average values of tongue and coat decrease from 60.21 to 57.18 and from 60.06 to 57.03 respectively. Secondly, the decrease of abnormality rate of tongue coat, included greasy tongue fur, putrid fur, teeth-mark, thick-thin fur, are of significant statistical difference ( < 0.05).

We have analysed the role of the cell surface protease aminopeptidase N (Anpep, APN, CD13) during these processes using Anpep deficient and Anpep over-expressing mice. We find that APN deficiency significantly delays mammary gland morphogenesis during gestation. The defect is characterised by a reduction in alveolar buds and duct branching at mid-pregnancy.

During the investigation, food service workers were observed to have bare-handed contact with ready-to-eat food. Five case-patients and one asymptomatic food service worker had stool samples positive for Salmonella species.

We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this special population. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. RESULTS: Nearly half (49.3%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). A history of heart failure was significantly associated with AKI after adjusting for baseline eGFR (OR 3.382, 95% CI 1.121-13.231, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: We report a high burden of AKI among underserved COVID-19 patients with multiple comorbidities. Those who had HA-AKI had worse clinical outcomes compared to those who with CA-AKI.

In this study, we aimed to reveal the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) imaging with respect to symptom duration. METHODS: This retrospective study involved patients from five centers, who were admitted with typical COVID-19 symptoms and found to be positive for COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) test. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients with positive COVID-19 rtRT-PCR test were involved in the study. Sixty percent of these patients had chest CT imaging findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The most common chest CT finding was bilateral and subpleural ground-glass opacity in middle-lower lobes of the lungs. Chest CT findings were detected in 85.1% of the patients with a symptom duration of more than 2 days. In receiver operating characteristic analysis of this parameter, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.869, while sensitivity and specificity were 90.5% and 76.2%, respectively. It was notable that chest CT findings were 7.17 times more common among the patients aged 60 years and older, with AUC, specificity, and positive predictive value of 0.768, 88.1%, and 84.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chest CT imaging is a quite valuable tool in patients with longer than 2 days' duration of symptoms, in whom clinical and epidemiological data support the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We suggest that the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia should be made with chest CT imaging when rtRT-PCR test cannot be performed or gives a negative result, which is important for public health and to prevent the spread of infection.","output":"The relationship between diagnostic value of chest computed tomography imaging and symptom duration in COVID infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compromised lung function is a feature of both infection driven and non-infective pathologies.

Due to its extensive number of mutations, this variant has high level of immune evasion, which drastically reduced the efficacy of existing antibodies and vaccines. Thus, it is important to develop an Omicron-specific vaccine and test if it can induce immune responses against Omicron and broadly against other variants. Here, we generated an Omicron-specific lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA vaccine candidate, and tested its potency of antibody induction in animals, both alone and as a booster to existing mRNA vaccine designed against the ancestral reference virus (WA-1). This Omicron-specific LNP-mRNA vaccine elicited strong and specific antibody response in vaccination-na?ve mice. Consistent with recent reports, mice that received two-dose WA-1 LNP-mRNA, the one mimicking the commonly used Pfizer/Moderna mRNA vaccine administered in the general population, showed a 41-fold reduction in neutralization potency against Omicron variant as compared to WA-1 two weeks post second dose, which further reduced to background level 3.5 months post second dose. As a booster for WA-1 mRNA vaccination, a single dose Omicron LNP-mRNA induced potent antibody response against the Omicron variant, with over 1,000-fold increase at two weeks post injection as compared to the blood samples right before booster. The Omicron-specific antibody level of the Omicron-boosted samples is numerically similar to WA-1 vaccine against WA-1 variant. This boost also elicited broader antibody responses against WA-1 and Delta variants, restoring these activities of the WA-1 vaccinated animals that also dropped over time. A consecutive second dose of Omicron LNP-mRNA 2 weeks following the first dose did not significantly increased the level of antibodies.

METHODS Electronic medical records of pediatric emergency department (PED) visits were reviewed. The percent positive of respiratory pathogens, tested by using viral polymerase chain reaction panel, was determined for the July 2012 to June 2013 period. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza with ICU admission during the 2012-2013 academic year. Medical records of visits leading to ICU admission with picornaviruses were reviewed. RESULTS During 2012-2013, picornaviruses were more commonly identified (22.6%) among admitted patients than influenza (6.4%) or RSV (15.1%). Picornaviruses and RSV were associated with ICU admission (picornaviruses: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68-2.36]; RSV: aOR, 1.49 [95% CI: 1.20-1.85]) while influenza was not (aOR, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.66-1.29]). Of visits resulting in ICU admission, 79% were from patients with previous high-risk medical conditions, of which asthma or a history of wheezing was the most common (43%). CONCLUSIONS Picornaviruses can be associated with severe disease in children, especially those with underlying medical conditions. During times of high picornavirus activity, hospitals should target infection control measures to limit the spread of picornaviruses and protect the vulnerable patients.

METHODS: The active ingredients and potential targets of SYKFT were obtained through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, the targets of GN were obtained through GeneCards, etc. Perl and Cytoscape were used to construct an herb-active ingredientCtarget network. Then, the clusterProfiler package of R was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. We also used the STRING platform and Cytoscape to construct a proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network, as well as the SwissTargetPrediction server to predict the target protein of the core active ingredient based on machine-learning model. Molecular-docking analysis was further performed using AutoDock Vina and Pymol. Finally, we verified the effect of SYKFT on GN in vivo. RESULTS: A total of 154 active ingredients and 255 targets in SYKFT were screened, and 135 targets were identified to be related to GN. GO enrichment analysis indicated that biological processes were primarily associated with oxidative stress and cell proliferation. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these targets were involved mostly in infection-related and GN-related pathways. PPI network analysis identified 13 core targets of SYKFT. Results of machine-learning model suggested that STAT3 and AKT1 may be the key target. Results of molecular docking suggested that the main active components of SYKFT can be combined with various target proteins. In vivo experiments confirmed that SYKFT may alleviate renal pathological injury by regulating core genes, thereby reducing urinary protein.

This study aimed to determine whether GCMSCs are involved in the inhibition of NK cell immune function and explore its underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CD107a and perforin expression of GCMSCs conditioned medium (GCMSCs-CM)-primed NK cells were detected by flow cytometry. To determine NK cell cytotoxicity, the CytoTox96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit was used. Glucose uptake and lactate production assay were performed to evaluate the metabolism state of NK cells treated with GCMSCs-CM. The expression of FBP1 in NK cells was analysed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: GCMSCs inhibited the degranulation capacity, perforin production and cytotoxicity of NK cells. GCMSCs-CM restrained NK cell glucose uptake and lactate production, thus weakening their glycolytic metabolism. FBP1 expression of NK cells was upregulated in the presence of GCMSCs-CM. Using FBP1 inhibitor could reverse the dysfunctional state of NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that GCMSCs could exert immunosuppressive effects on NK cells by up-regulating FBP1 expression, opening up new avenues for NK cell-based GC immunotherapy.","output":"Gastric cancer mesenchymal stem cells inhibit natural killer cell function by up-regulating FBP1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated surgical instrument localization is an important technology to understand the surgical process and in order to analyze them to provide meaningful guidance during surgery or surgical index after surgery to the surgeon.

We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. RESULTS: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0C510] vs. 1500[650C2300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500C1900] vs. 2600[1600C3800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17C0.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores and calibration plots in the test set. SETTING: Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset including over 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 17 086 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between 20 February 2020 and 5 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality while hospitalised. RESULTS: The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index=0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index=0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index=0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.3% for patients aged 18 years old, 8.9% for 55 years old and 28.7% for 85 years old. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 22.4% by March to 14.0% by May. CONCLUSION: Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality, although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information, with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The full model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.","output":"Prognostic model to identify and quantify risk factors for mortality among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a worldwide pandemic.

Methods: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional study with a convenience sample in Greece from December 2021 to March 2022. We measured socio-demographic data of pregnant women, COVID-19-related vaccination status, worry about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, trust in COVID-19 vaccines, and COVID-19-related stress. Results: The study population included 812 pregnant women with a mean age of 31.6 years. Among the pregnant women, 58.6% had received a COVID-19 vaccine. The most important reasons that pregnant women were not vaccinated were doubts about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines (31.4%), fear that COVID-19 vaccines could be harmful to fetus (29.4%), and fear of adverse side effects of COVID-19 vaccines (29.4%). Increased danger and contamination fears, increased fears about economic consequences, and higher levels of trust in COVID-19 vaccines were related with COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the gold standard for the detection of SARS-COV-2. There are several challenges associated with this test from sample collection to processing and the longer turnaround time for the results to be available. More rapid and faster diagnostic tests that may produce results within minutes to a few hours will be instrumental in controlling the disease. Serological tests that detect specific antibodies to the virus may be such options. In this review, we extensively searched for studies that compared RT-PCR with serological tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We extracted the data from the various selected studies that compared the different tests and summarised the available evidence to determine which test is more appropriate especially in Africa. We also reviewed the current evidence and the challenges for the genome sequencing of SARS-COV-2 in Africa. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different diagnostic tests and the importance of genome sequencing in identifying potential therapeutic options for the control of COVID-19 in Africa.","output":"Genome sequencing and the diagnosis of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in Africa: how far are we?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator of cell entry and the focus for development of protective antibodies and vaccines.

Although an increase of the peripheral IP-10 level is known in HBV-infected patients, the molecular basis of HBV infection inducing IP-10 expression has remained elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx) increases IP-10 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of the HBx-expressing vector into HepG2 cells results in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, which directly binds the promoter of IP-10 at positions from -122 to -113, thus facilitating transcription. The addition of the NF-kappaB inhibitor blocks the effect of HBx on IP-10 induction. In parallel, increase of NF-kappaB subunits p65 and p50 in HepG2 cells also augments IP-10 expression. Furthermore, we show that HBx induces activation of NF-kappaB through the TRAF2/TAK1 signaling pathway, leading to up-regulation of IP-10 expression. As a consequence, up-regulation of IP-10 may mediate the migration of peripheral blood leukocytes in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner. In conclusion, we report a novel molecular mechanism of HBV infection inducing IP-10 expression, which involves viral protein HBx affecting NF-kappaB pathway, leading to transactivation of the IP-10 promoter. Our study provides insight into the migration of leukocytes in response to HBV infection, thus causing immune pathological injury of liver.","output":"Hepatitis B virus protein X-induced expression of the CXC chemokine IP-10 is mediated through activation of NF-kappaB and increases migration of leukocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led many healthcare systems to become overwhelmed, and caused many frontline providers to feel fatigued and exhausted and experience severe emotional trauma. Nurses are the largest group of the world's frontline providers and it is clear that their resilience to threatening factors is critical in the current crisis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the level of resilience in nurses working in COVID-19 centers in Iran. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 nurses working at three COVID-19 centers in northwest Iran. The participants were recruited using simple random sampling. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to collect the data. RESULTS: The highest level of resilience was related to spiritual influences, while the lowest was the trust in their instincts and tolerance of negative emotions. Furthermore, the level of resilience was significantly higher in nurses with better family support (p < 0.01).

PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to measure the impact of anti-reflux needleless connector usage in prevention of intraluminal thrombotic occlusions among central venous catheters, as represented by alteplase usage, in a home infusion patient population. METHODS: An18-month before-and-after cohort study of a single home infusion intervention was conducted to compare occlusion outcomes with use of two types of needleless connectors-neutral and anti-reflux-in preventing catheter occlusions, which have been reported to occur in 28% of home infusion patients, resulting in treatment delays, increased nursing encounters and emergency room visits, and higher overall pharmacy costs for supplies and alteplase. RESULTS: A total of 552,707 patient therapy days were studied: 42.5% in the neutral needleless connector group (n = 235,004 therapy days) and 57.5% in the anti-reflux needleless connector group (n = 317,703 therapy days). The rate of alteplase usage with neutral versus anti-reflux needleless connectors was 4.4% versus 2.2% per 1,000 therapy days, with median alteplase use of 112 (95% CI, 89-169) units versus 82 (95% CI, 68-109) units (P < 0.001). Implementation of anti-reflux connectors reduced occlusions and alteplase usage by 48%. CONCLUSION: Statistical evidence demonstrated that use of anti-reflux needleless connectors with central venous access devices reduced the need for alteplase in the study population. Since 10% of patient occlusions were within 7 days after home infusion admission, future research may indicate that placement of anti-reflux needleless connectors at the time of in-hospital insertion can improve patient outcomes.

Our aim was to profile the transcriptome in leukocytes from critically ill patients positive for COVID19 compared to those negative for COVID19 to better understand the COVID19-associated host response. For these studies, all patients admitted to our tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected at the time of admission to the ICU. Transcriptome profiling of leukocytes via ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) was then performed and differentially expressed genes as well as significantly enriched gene sets were identified. RESULTS: We enrolled seven COVID19 + (PCR positive, 2 SARS-CoV-2 genes) and seven age- and sex-matched COVID19- (PCR negative) control ICU patients. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that COVID19- patients had significantly higher total white blood cell counts and circulating neutrophils and COVID19 + patients were more likely to suffer bilateral pneumonia. The mortality rate for this cohort of COVID19 + ICU patients was 29%. As indicated by both single-gene based and gene set (GSEA) approaches, the major disease-specific transcriptional responses of leukocytes in critically ill COVID19 + ICU patients were: (i) a robust overrepresentation of interferon-related gene expression; (ii) a marked decrease in the transcriptional level of genes contributing to general protein synthesis and bioenergy metabolism; and (iii) the dysregulated expression of genes associated with coagulation, platelet function, complement activation, and tumour necrosis factor/interleukin 6 signalling.

In statistics, PL distribution is often found to fit data exceptionally well when the normal (Gaussian) distribution fails. Nevertheless, predicting PL phenomena is notoriously difficult because of some of its idiosyncratic properties, such as lack of well-defined average value and potentially unbounded variance. Taylor's power law (TPL) is a PL first discovered to characterize the spatial and/or temporal distribution of biological populations. It has also been extended to describe the spatiotemporal heterogeneities (distributions) of human microbiomes and other natural and artificial systems, such as fitness distribution in computational (artificial) intelligence. The PL with exponential cutoff (PLEC) is a variant of power-law function that tapers off the exponential growth of power-law function ultimately and can be particularly useful for certain predictive problems, such as biodiversity estimation and turning-point prediction for Coronavirus Diease-2019 (COVID-19) infection/fatality. Here, we propose coupling (integration) of TPL and PLEC to offer a methodology for quantifying the uncertainty in certain estimation (prediction) problems that can be modeled with PLs. The coupling takes advantage of variance prediction using TPL and asymptote estimation using PLEC and delivers CI for the asymptote. We demonstrate the integrated approach to the estimation of potential (dark) biodiversity of the American gut microbiome (AGM) and the turning point of COVID-19 fatality. We expect this integrative approach should have wide applications given duel (contesting) relationship between PL and normal statistical distributions.

Lenzilumab, a GM-CSF neutralising monoclonal antibody, was investigated in the LIVE-AIR trial to assess its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 beyond available treatments. METHODS: In LIVE-AIR, a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were recruited from 29 sites in the USA and Brazil and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three intravenous doses of lenzilumab (600 mg per dose) or placebo delivered 8 h apart. All patients received standard supportive care, including the use of remdesivir and corticosteroids. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age and disease severity. The primary endpoint was survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 in the modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), comprising all randomised participants who received at least one dose of study drug under the documented supervision of the principal investigator or sub-investigator. Adverse events were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04351152, and is completed. FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled from May 5, 2020, until Jan 27, 2021. 528 patients were screened, of whom 520 were randomly assigned and included in the intention-to-treat population. 479 of these patients (n=236, lenzilumab; n=243, placebo) were included in the mITT analysis for the primary outcome. Baseline demographics were similar between groups. 311 (65%) participants were males, mean age was 61 (SD 14) years at baseline, and median C-reactive protein concentration was 79 (IQR 41C137) mg/L. Steroids were administered to 449 (94%) patients and remdesivir to 347 (72%) patients; 331 (69%) patients received both treatments. Survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 was achieved in 198 (84%; 95% CI 79C89) participants in the lenzilumab group and in 190 (78%; 72C83) patients in the placebo group, and the likelihood of survival was greater with lenzilumab than placebo (hazard ratio 154; 95% CI 102C232; p=0040). 68 (27%) of 255 patients in the lenzilumab group and 84 (33%) of 257 patients in the placebo group experienced at least one adverse event that was at least grade 3 in severity based on CTCAE criteria. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher were related to respiratory disorders (26%) and cardiac disorders (6%) and none led to death. INTERPRETATION: Lenzilumab significantly improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

An amazing herb, Nigella sativa, having antiviral, antihypertensive, anti- diarrhoeal, analgesics, and anti-bacterial properties, needs to be explored for its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In-silico studies were carried out to understand the role of its bioactive constituents in COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Firstly, the disease network was prepared by using ACE2 (Angiotensin-II receptor), as it is the entry site for virus. It was used to decipher the mechanism of SARS-COV-2 infection in humans. Second, the target receptors for N. sativa were predicted and protein interaction studies were conducted. Further, docking studies were also performed to analyse it for treatment purpose as well. This study concludes that pathways undertaken by N. sativa bioactive constituents were similar to the pathways followed in SARS-COV-2 pathology, like renin-angiotensin system, kidney functions, regulation of blood circulation, blood vessel diameter, etc. Also, in docking studies, the constituents of N. sativa, -hederin, Thymohydroquinone and Thymoquinone were observed to be efficiently binding to ACE2. Also, the bioactive phytoconstituents are involved in molecular pathways like HIF1, VEGF, IL-17, AGE-RAGE, chemokine and calcium signaling pathways which can be majorly helpful in combating hypoxia and inflammation caused due to compromised immune system and oxidative stress. Therefore, N. sativa standardized extract having the above phytoconstituents could be useful in COVID-19 and hence opens a new treatment line.","output":"Deciphering underlying mechanism of Sars-CoV-2 infection in humans and revealing the therapeutic potential of bioactive constituents from Nigella sativa to combat COVID19: in-silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare systems worldwide.

Therefore the objective of this study was to use measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to monitor viral trends and variants in a small island community over a twelve-month period beginning May 1, 2020, before the community re-opened to tourists. Wastewater samples were collected weekly and analyzed to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Sanger sequencing was used to determine genome sequences from total RNA extracted from wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2. Visitor data was collected from the local Chamber of Commerce. We performed Poisson and linear regression to determine if visitors to the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2-positive wastewater samples and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results indicated that weekly wastewater samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 until mid-July when positive samples were recorded in four of five consecutive weeks. Additional positive results were recorded in November and December 2020, as well as January, March, and April 2021. Tourism data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater increased by 1.06 Log(10) genomic copies/L per 100 tourists weekly. Sequencing from six positive wastewater samples yielded two complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2, two overlapping sequences, and two low yield sequences. They show arrival of a new variant SARS-CoV-2 in January 2021. Our results demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in a small community. Wastewater surveillance and viral genome sequencing suggest that population mobility likely plays an important role in the introduction and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants among communities experiencing high tourism and who have a small population size.","output":"Wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in a small coastal community: Effects of tourism on viral presence and variant identification among low prevalence populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although it is known that inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use may increase the risk of respiratory infection, its influence on the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between ICS use and the positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS: Nationwide data of 44,968 individuals with chronic respiratory diseases tested for SARS-CoV-2 until May 15, 2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in Korea. The positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection was retrospectively analysed according to the prescription, type, and dose of ICS taken one year before SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Among 44,968 individuals tested, 931 (2.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 7,019 patients (15.6%) were prescribed ICS one year prior to being tested for SARS-CoV-2. Low, medium, and high doses of ICS were prescribed in 7.5%, 1.6%, and 6.5% of total cases, respectively. Among types of ICS, budesonide, fluticasone, beclomethasone, and ciclesonide were prescribed in 3.7%, 8.9%, 2.3%, and 0.6% of total cases, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed no significant increase in infection with ICS use (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.66C1.03). Moreover, there were no associations between the positivity of infection and the dose or type of ICS prescribed. CONCLUSION: Prior ICS use did not increase the positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100 000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6 % of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility.

Methods and Results: Email invitations to participate in an online survey were distributed among physicians to analyse almost simultaneously recorded PPG, single-lead ECG and 12-lead ECG traces from 30 patients (10 in sinus rhythm (SR), 10 in SR with ectopic beats and 10 in AF). The task was to classify the readings as SR', ectopic/missed beats', AF', flutter' or unreadable'. Sixty-five physicians detected or excluded AF based on the raw PPG waveforms with 88.8% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity. Additional presentation of the tachogram plus Poincar plot significantly increased sensitivity and specificity to 95.5% (P < 0.001) and 92.5% (P < 0.001), respectively. The algorithm information did not further increase the accuracy to detect AF (sensitivity 97.5%, P = 0.556; specificity 95.0%, P = 0.182). Physicians detected AF on single-lead ECG tracings with 91.2% sensitivity and 93.9% specificity. Diagnostic accuracy was also not optimal on full 12-lead ECGs (93.9 and 98.6%, respectively). Notably, there was no significant difference between the performance of PPG waveform plus tachogram and Poincar, compared to a single-lead ECG to detect or exclude AF (sensitivity P = 0.672; specificity P = 0.536).

Control of thermal spread from the forceps tips into surrounding neural tissues is a persistent concern, as neural tissues are especially vulnerable to heat injury. The purpose of our investigation was to compare the efficacy of cooling mechanisms for four different bipolar forceps and to understand thermal spread when coagulating vessels on the spinal cord. METHODS Immediately following euthanasia, the dura mater of an ex vivo porcine model was opened to expose vessels on the spinal cord for coagulation. Temperature profiles were measured at generator power of 25 W and at fixed 5-second activation times. The bipolar forceps used in this study included regular stainless steel, titanium, heat-pipe embedded, and SILVERGlide forceps. Temperature was measured by micro-thermistor at the midpoint between the bipolar tips, and 1 and 2 mm away from the midpoint along the centerline. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate temperature differences. RESULTS Temperature profiles indicated that heat-pipe embedded forceps create the least amount of temperature increase and the highest normalized temperature decreasing slope after activation. The decreasing slope of SILVERGlide forceps is slightly higher than that of regular stainless steel forceps. CONCLUSIONS Bipolar forceps incorporating either heat-pipe embedded technology or SILVERGlide coating can effectively limit excessive thermal spread, thus decreasing potential injury to adjacent tissues when compared with standard stainless steel and titanium bipolar forceps.

Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem service into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases, and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both; (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the biodiversity crisis.

Our test shows a very good correlation with the conventional and molecular neutralization assays and achieves 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity. cbE-VNT is cost-effective, fast and enables a large-scale serological evaluation that can be performed in a BSL2 laboratory, allowing its use in pre-clinical and clinical investigations.","output":"A cell-based ELISA as surrogate of virus neutralization assay for RBD SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuing rise in global antimicrobial resistance is seen by many governments and international organizations as a major threat to worldwide health.

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospitalization especially in children < 2 year-old. Although the clinical findings are different in these two diseases, it is sometimes difficult to make this distinction in partially or fully vaccinated children. This study aimed to identify the incidence, clinical and laboratory effects of B. pertussis as a causative agent in hospitalized children with acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: The study included patients diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis and admitted to the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases from January 2012 to December 2015, aged 24 months or younger, evaluated for viruses and bacteria with polymerase chain reaction in respiratory tract secretions. RESULTS: The study included 380 patients hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis. Of these patients, 85.8% were identified to be positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. The most commonly identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, bocavirus and metapneumovirus A/B. B. pertussis was only detected in 5 patients (1.5%). In the patients with B. pertussis identified, coinfection with another virus was observed including rhinovirus (n= 2), influenza A virus (n= 1), coronavirus OC43 (n= 1) and RSV A/B (n= 1). The presence of B. pertussis did not appear to cause any significant clinical or laboratory differences in patients. CONCLUSIONS: B. pertussis is a rare pathogen in patients admitted to hospital for acute bronchiolitis. However, in patients who do not respond to standard bronchiolitis treatment, B. pertussis should be considered as a causative agent. Early identification of this pathogen is important in terms of quarantining the patient, administering appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and prophylactic treatment to household and other close contacts.","output":"The incidence and clinical effects of Bordetella pertussis in children hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease has been severe and a cause for major concern around the world. Due to immunological and physiological changes during pregnancy, pregnant women have a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to collect and integrate the results of previous studies to get an accurate representation and interpretation of the clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiological findings, and characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19. We conducted a scientific search in main databases with a combination of related MESH terms and keywords. The outcomes included common clinical symptoms at the time of onset of the disease, common laboratory and radiological findings, the rates of vaginal delivery and Cesarean section, Cesarean section indications, maternal complications, and vertical transmission rates. A total of 51 studies comprising 571 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, respectively. Elevated C-reactive protein and ground-glass opacities were the most common laboratory and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. A total of 114 Cesarean sections were performed due to COVID-19-related concerns. There were 55 cases of intubation (11.6%) and 13 maternal deaths (2.3%). The vertical transmission rate was 7.9%. We conclude that the characteristics of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 in pregnant women do not appear to be different from those in the general population with COVID-19 infections. However, pregnant women with underlying diseases were more likely to develop COVID-19 than others, and, in those infected with the virus, the rate of Cesarean delivery and preterm birth increased.","output":"A Systematic Review of 571 Pregnancies Affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Van der Waals (VdW) materials have opened new directions in the study of low dimensional magnetism.

Here, we take a different approach to engineer new ground-states, not by exfoliation, but by tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the non-magnetic ligand atoms (Cl,Br,I). We synthesize a three-halide series, CrCl$_{3-x-y}$Br$_{x}$I$_{y}$, and map their magnetic properties as a function of Cl, Br, and I content. The resulting triangular phase diagrams unveil a frustrated regime near CrCl$_{3}$. First-principles calculations confirm that the frustration is driven by a competition between the chromium and halide SOCs.

A literature search up from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2021 was conducted in three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, in order to identify studies on periodontal disease alone or in conjunction with diabetes mellitus, reporting any relation with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a primary outcome. Only articles published in the English language were included. Due to the lack of studies, we decided to collect all the theoretical and clinical evidence suggesting a possible biological pathway evidencing the relationship among PD, DM, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. From a total of 29 articles, 12 were included for final review studies (five reviews, two hypotheses, one Special Issue, one perspective, one commentary, one case-control study, and one case report). In addition, this systematic review article hypothesizes the correlation between PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in periodontal tissue and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. T2DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels resulting from altered insulin secretion or action. Likewise, periodontitis and T2DM are inflammatory disorders with a bidirectional association, and both diseases have a similar immunomodulatory cascade and cytokine profile. ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the key factor of entry in the cells by the new SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is widely distributed in the lung and kidneys, and interestingly has a great distribution in the oral cavity, principally in the tongue and periodontal tissue. ACE2 in periodontal tissue plays a crucial role between health and disease. Moreover, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis is downregulated in the dysbiotic and inflammatory periodontal environment. Nevertheless, the balance of ACE2 activity is modified in the context of concurrent diabetes, increasing the expression of ACE2 by the uncontrolled glycemia chronic in T2DM. Therefore, the uncontrolled hyperglycemia possibly increases the risk of developing periodontitis and triggering overexpression of ACE2 in periodontal tissue of T2DM patients, with these events potentially being essential to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of mild-to-severe form of COVID-19. In this sense, we would like to point out that the need for randomized controlled trials is imperative to support this association.","output":"Should We Be Concerned about the Association of Diabetes Mellitus and Periodontal Disease in the Risk of Infection by SARS-CoV-2?

Despite many studies using cryoEM and smFRET, the precise mechanism of Cas3-mediated cleavage and degradation of target DNA remains elusive. Here we reconstitute the CRISPR-Cas3 system in vitro to show how the Escherichia coli Cas3 (EcoCas3) with EcoCascade exhibits collateral non-specific ssDNA cleavage and target specific DNA degradation. Partial binding of EcoCascade to target DNA with tolerated mismatches within the spacer sequence, but not the PAM, elicits collateral ssDNA cleavage activity of recruited EcoCas3. Conversely, stable binding with complete R-loop formation drives EcoCas3 to nick the non-target strand (NTS) in the bound DNA. Helicase-dependent unwinding then combines with trans ssDNA cleavage of the target strand and repetitive cis cleavage of the NTS to degrade the target dsDNA substrate. High-speed atomic force microscopy demonstrates that EcoCas3 bound to EcoCascade repeatedly reels and releases the target DNA, followed by target fragmentation. Together, these results provide a revised model for collateral ssDNA cleavage and target dsDNA degradation by CRISPR-Cas3, furthering understanding of type I CRISPR priming and interference and informing future genome editing tools.","output":"Dynamic mechanisms of CRISPR interference by Escherichia coli CRISPR-Cas3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A metal nanoparticle composite, namely TPNT1, which contains Au-NP (1 ppm), Ag-NP (5 ppm), ZnO-NP (60 ppm) and ClO(2) (42.5 ppm) in aqueous solution was prepared and characterized by spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering analysis and potentiometric titration.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The introduction of telemedicine increased the number of cycles within 6 months from the first consultation and reduced the drop-out rate. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In Italy during the complete lockdown due to the first pandemic wave of SARS-CoVC2 the activity of fertility centers were stopped, with the exception of fertility preservation procedures for oncological patients. We therefore proposed a service of telemedicine to our patients, that we called SmartPMA. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A longitudinal study performed at a public infertility center. The SmartPMA service was offered to 93 couples referred to our center from March 9th to May 31st, 2020. Initially 72 couples was interested in SmartPMA. Our center gradually re-opened and the first oocytes retrieval was performed on June 9th . PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Sixty-one out of 72 couples (85%) performed the SmartPMA from April 7th to June 16th, 2020. After acquiring informed consent and sending two anamnestic questionnaires, we booked a video-consultation with a gynecologist and a biologist. Afterwards, we sent medical prescriptions for appropriate clinical tests. At the re-opening, we offered the chance to start the ART cycle. Time to the first treatment and drop-out rates were compared to historical controls (2017C2019) using chi-square test. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eleven couples declined the SmartPMA and booked an appointment at the reopening. Only 2 of these couples (18%) actually performed an IVF treatment within six months. Three out the 61 couples that accepted the SmartPMA did not perform IVF treatments because the age of women exceeded the legal limit to access to a public ART center. Twelve out of 58 couples (21%) did not performed any IVF treatment for the following reasons: 4 women spontaneously got pregnant, 1 couple gave up for medical reasons, 3 were referred to ovodonation, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-eight out of 58 couples (66%) (median age of woman: 36 + 4 years, range 27C43) performed at least one ART treatment (14 IUI, 12 ICSI cycle, 12 FIVET cycle). Eight out of 58 couples (14%) needed further clinical tests and their treatments are ongoing. The mean time to first treatment in the SmartPMA couples was 4 + 1 months (range 1C6). After SmartPMA, 66% of the couples performed the first cycle within 6 months, compared to 37% of controls (333/898 couples at their first access to our center from 2017 to 2019), p < 0.00001. The drop-out was reduced from 39% to 20%, p = 0 .0038. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We cannot exclude that the couples that joined the SmartPMA service during the pandemic period were particularly motivated to perform IVF treatments. We are aware of the small sample size and that this is a monocentric study. Wider implications of the findings: Even after the pandemic, telemedicine can be an useful tool for fertility centers to reduce the discomfort of several visits in hospital, without losing patients but rather ultimately reducing the time to treatments and drop-out.

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","output":"Massive transient damage of the olfactory epithelium associated with infection of sustentacular cells by SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is associated with inflammation, coagulopathy, and organ damage found in severe cases of COVID-19.

Cocoa flavanols are promising nutraceuticals with possible beneficial vascular effects in humans. However, limited research is currently available on the vascular effects in a diabetic population with inconsistent results. Possible reasons for this inconsistency might be heterogeneity in the given intervention (dose per time and day, single dose vs. split-dose, placebo formula) and the studied population (blood pressure at baseline, duration of diabetes, use of vasoactive antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs, sex). Therefore, we aimed to develop a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial to investigate whether cocoa flavanols have an acute impact on blood pressure and vascular reactivity in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without arterial hypertension. Methods and Analysis: We will include participants in four groups: (i) patients with type 2 diabetes without arterial hypertension, (ii) patients with type 2 diabetes with arterial hypertension and 1 antihypertensive drug, (iii) non-diabetic participants with essential hypertension and 1 antihypertensive drug, and (iv) healthy controls. All participants will complete the same protocol on both testing days, consuming high-flavanol cocoa extract (790 mg flavanols) or placebo. Macrovascular endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation) and blood pressure will be measured before and after capsule ingestion. Forearm muscle vasoreactivity (near-infrared spectroscopy) and brachial artery blood flow (echo-doppler) will be assessed in response to a dynamic handgrip exercise test after capsule ingestion.

Respiratory health screening, which included a job and exposure history, a chest X-ray (CXR), a respiratory health questionnaire, and gas transfer testing, were offered to stonemasons in Victoria, Australia. Workers typically reported a variety of tasks, including cleaning and labouring, which made exposure assessment complex. We estimated the relative respirable crystalline silica exposure intensity of each job from the proportion of time using AS and the proportion of time doing dry work (work without water suppression). The relative average intensity of exposure for up to five jobs was calculated. Cumulative exposure was calculated as the sum of the duration multiplied by intensity for each job. Installers and factory machinists (other than computer numeric control operators) were the most likely to report dry work with AS, and so had a greater average intensity of exposure. Exposure intensity and cumulative exposure were associated with increased odds of an ILO (International Labour Organisation) CXR profusion major category of 1 and with dyspnoea. Exposure duration was also associated with ILO profusion category. In multivariate analyses of health outcomes, only job type was associated with the ILO profusion category. For both most recent and longest-duration job types, when compared to the lowest exposure group, factory machinists were more likely to have an ILO category 1. This suggests that intensity of exposure estimated from the proportion of time dry cutting and proportion of time working on AS can predict the risk of adverse respiratory outcomes for workers in this industry.","output":"Silica Exposure Estimates in Artificial Stone Benchtop Fabrication and Adverse Respiratory Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has significant implications for the cardiovascular care of patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of newly diagnosed back pain among lecturers and undergraduates from a tertiary education centre during the COVID-19 lockdown and to identify the possible factors associated with this back pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted among 1,500 lecturers and students of Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS). The questionnaire used was modified from previous studies on back pain. RESULTS There were 346 newly diagnosed cases of back pain among students and lecturers of UMS. More than half of the participants (61.2%) suffered lower back pain in the lumbar region. There was a significant correlation between increased time of sitting and reduced exercise time, and the incidence of back pain. Poor ergonomic sitting conditions and poor perceived health conditions during the lockdown period also had a significant impact on the frequency of back pain. CONCLUSION The university community has undergone a significant increase in sitting time and a decrease in exercise time during the lockdown. This has contributed to an increase in the frequency of back pain. It is recommended that further studies be done to guide the university community regarding the maintenance of exercise and management of sitting hours, in order to reduce the frequency of back pain.","output":"Increased incidence and aetiological factors of back pain among Universiti Malaysia Sabah staff and undergraduates during the COVID-19 lockdown period."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a common complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), but the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

A 4-h glucose tolerance test (GTT) was used to assess the incidence and extent of hypoglycemia. METHODS Thirty-six patients who were at least 6 months postoperative from RYGB were administered a 4-h GTT with measurement of insulin levels. Mean age was 49.411.4 years, mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 48.86.6 kg/m2, percent excess BMI lost (%EBL) was 62.6  21.6%, mean weight change from nadir weight was 8.28.6 kg, and mean follow-up time was 40.526.7 months. Twelve patients had diabetes preoperatively. RESULTS Thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) had abnormal GTT. Six patients (17%) were identified as diabetic based on GTT. All six of these patients were diabetic preoperatively. Twenty-six patients (72%) had evidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 2 h post glucose load. Within this cohort of 26 patients, 14 had maximum to minimum glucose ratio (MMGR)>3:1, 5 with a ratio>4:1. Eleven patients had weight regain greater than 10% of initial weight loss (range 4.9-25.6 kg). Ten of these 11 patients (91%) with weight recidivism showed reactive hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal GTT is a common finding post RYGB. Persistence of diabetes was noted in 50% of patients with diabetes preoperatively. Amongst the nondiabetic patients, reactive hypoglycemia was found to be more common and pronounced than expected. Absence of abnormally high insulin levels does not support nesidioblastosis as an etiology of this hypoglycemia. More than 50% of patients with reactive hypoglycemia had significantly exaggerated MMGR. We believe this may be due to the nonphysiologic transit of food to the small intestine due to lack of a pyloric valve after RYGB. This reactive hypoglycemia may contribute to maladaptive eating behaviors leading to weight regain long term. Our data suggest that GTT is an important part of post-RYGB follow-up and should be incorporated into the routine postoperative screening protocol. Further studies on the impact of pylorus preservation are necessary.","output":"Abnormal glucose tolerance testing following gastric bypass demonstrates reactive hypoglycemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although life-saving in selected patients, ECMO treatment still has high mortality which for a large part is due to treatment-related complications. A feared complication is ischemic stroke for which heparin is routinely administered for which the dosage is usually guided by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). However, there is no relation between aPTT and the rare occurrence of ischemic stroke (1.2%), but there is a relation with the much more frequent occurrence of bleeding complications (55%) and blood transfusion. Both are strongly related to outcome. METHODS: We will conduct a three-arm non-inferiority randomized controlled trial, in adult patients treated with ECMO. Participants will be randomized between heparin administration with a target of 2C2.5 times baseline aPTT, 1.5C2 times baseline aPTT, or low molecular weight heparin guided by weight and renal function. Apart from anticoagulation targets, treatment will be according to standard care. The primary outcome parameter is a combined endpoint consisting of major bleeding including hemorrhagic stroke, severe thromboembolic complications including ischemic stroke, and mortality at 6 months. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that with lower anticoagulation targets or anticoagulation with LMWH during ECMO therapy, patients will have fewer hemorrhagic complications without an increase in thromboembolic complication or a negative effect on their outcome. If our hypothesis is confirmed, this study could lead to a change in anticoagulation protocols and a better outcome for patients treated with ECMO. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04536272.

Disruptions to TB programs and healthcare services due to COVID-19 could potentially prolong diagnostic delays and worsen TB treatment adherence and outcomes. The economic recession caused by the pandemic could significantly impact household financial capacity because of the reduction of income and the rise in unemployment rates. All of these factors increase the risk of TB incidence and the gravity of economic impact on TB-affected households, and hamper efforts to eliminate catastrophic costs and control TB. Therefore, efforts to eliminate the incidence of TB-affected households facing catastrophic costs will be very challenging. Because financial constraint plays a significant role in TB control, the improvement of health and social protection systems is critical. Even before the pandemic, many TBChigh-burden countries (HBCs) lacked robust health and social protection systems.

However, existing drugs are insufficient in dealing with this contagious virus infection;therefore, a vaccine is exigent to curb this pandemic disease. In the present study, B- and T-cell immune epitopes were identified for RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) protein using immunoinformatic techniques, which is proved to be a rapid and efficient method to explore the candidate peptide vaccine. Subsequently, antigenicity and interactions with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles were estimated. Further, physicochemical properties, allergenicity, toxicity, and stability of RdRp protein were evaluated to demonstrate the specificity of the epitope candidates. Interestingly, we identified a total of 36 B-cell and 16 T-cell epitopes using epitopes predictive tools. Among the predicted epitopes, 26 B-cell and 9 T-cell epitopes showed non-allergenic, non-toxic, and highly antigenic properties.

A novel mapping software integrating vector data and applying an algorithmic solution taking into consideration global activation pattern has been recently described (Coherent?, Biosense Webster \\"Investigational\\"). OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the investigational algorithm to determine the mechanism of AT compared with the standard algorithm. METHODS This study included patients who underwent ablation of scar-related AT using the Carto 3 and the standard activation algorithm. The mapping data was analyzed retrospectively using the investigational algorithm, and the mechanisms were evaluated by two independent electrophysiologists. RESULTS A total of 77 scar-related AT activation maps were analyzed (89.6% left atrium, median tachycardia cycle length of 273 milliseconds). Of those, 67 cases with confirmed mechanism of the arrhythmia were used to compare the activation software. The actual mechanism of the arrhythmia was more likely to be identified with the investigational algorithm (67.2% vs 44.8%, P=0.009). In 5 patients with dual-loop circuits, 3/5 (60%) were correctly identified by the investigational algorithm compared to 0/5 (0%) with the standard software.

The terrain is, on the one hand, vast and diverse. On the other hand, under the banner of universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a streamlined version of 'community health' is increasingly being consolidated in global health and donor communities. With the view to informing debate and practice, this paper seeks to synthesise approaches to the CHS into a set of 'lenses,' drawing on the collective and multi-disciplinary knowledge (both formal and experiential) of the authors, a collaborative network of 23 researchers from seven institutions across six countries (spanning low, middle and high income). With a common view of the CHS as a complex adaptive system, we propose four key lenses, referred to as programmatic, relational, collective action and critical lenses. The lenses represent different positionalities in community health, encompassing macro-level policy-maker, front-line and community vantage points, and purposes ranging from social justice to instrumental goals. We define and describe the main elements of each lens and their implications for thinking about policy, practice and research. Distilling a set of key lenses offers a way to make sense of a complex terrain, but also counters what may emerge as a dominant, single narrative on the CHS in global health. By making explicit and bringing together different lenses on the CHS, the limits and possibilities of each may be better appreciated, while promoting integrative, systems thinking in policy, practice and research.","output":"The Multiple Lenses on the Community Health System: Implications for Policy, Practice and Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since being declared a pandemic in March 2020, COVID-19 has brought difficult situations for citizens of nations worldwide.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our experience with bariatric patients with prior LSG undergoing laparoscopic HH repair from August 2010 to July 2016. Patient demographics and outcomes including mortality, length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, reoperation, and complications were described. A validated 13-point questionnaire was used to determine symptomatic relief, weight loss, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS A total of nine consecutive patients with prior LSG underwent HH repair and were included in the analysis. Repair was performed using Bio-A Gore? mesh (W.L Gore Inc., Newark, DE) in six (66.7%) cases and posterior cruroplasty in three (33.3%) patients. Heartburn was significantly decreased at 1 year (1.4  0.9 vs. 2.6  0.9, p = 0.031), and 78% of patients reported some degree of symptomatic relief after HH repair. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic HH repair offers a safe and feasible approach in the management of persistent GERD after LSG in well-selected bariatric patients.

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials must start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in between \\"cure\\" and \\"death\\" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in relating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of \\"recovered\\" vs \\"not recovered.\\" Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may increase power for interim analyses.","output":"Endpoints for randomized controlled clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing threats in the area of information security raise the necessity for companies to be prepared for a digital forensic investigation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the western Uganda community on the proper use of face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was carried out from 1(st) July to 10(th) July 2020 among western Ugandans of consent age of 18 years and above. Data was analysed using Stata version 14.2. RESULTS: Among the respondents (n = 1114), the mean age was 30.7 (SD 11.1), 51% were males, 53.9% married and 43% had attained secondary education. Most participants (60.1%, n = 670) had satisfactory knowledge on the use of face masks and participants at a tertiary education level [AOR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.42C4.67; p = 0.002)] were likely to have satisfactory knowledge than participants who had not education. On attitude, most respondents (69.4%) were confident enough to correctly put on a face mask; 83.4% believed that a face mask can protect against COVID-19 and 75.9% of respondents had never shared their face mask. The majority of respondents (95.2%) agreed wearing face masks in public places was important to protect themselves against COVID-19; 60.3% reported washing their hands before wearing and after removing the face mask. Unfortunately, 51.5% reported removing the face mask if they needed to talk to someone. CONCLUSION: Despite the satisfactory knowledge, good attitude and practices, there is still much more to be done in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices among participants.

Using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and causality tests, the study analyzed the relationship between real GDP, tourist arrivals, foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into the tourism sector and FDI in the others sectors. The results obtained indicate that there is a positive relationship between tourist arrivals and economic growth in the long-run. The results also show that non-tourism FDI has a positive and significant impact on economic growth, while tourism FDI has a negative effect on economic growth. In addition, long-run causality results show that the hypothesis of economic growth driven by tourist arrivals and foreign direct investment is significant at the 1% level. Similarly, our results show that in the long-run, the hypothesis of tourism demand driven by economic growth and FDI is significant at the 1% level. The Granger causality test reveals a one-way causal relationship from economic growth to tourist arrivals, FDI flows in the tourism sectors and FDI flows in the non-tourism sectors in Morocco. This study suggests that decisions-makers should align the tourism strategy with other sectoral plans in a global, coherent and integrated strategic vision to take full advantage of FDI and international tourism.

Experts have speculated that consuming misinformation online can potentially worsen the mental health of individuals, by causing heightened anxiety, stress, and even suicidal ideation. The present study aims to quantify the causal relationship between sharing misinformation, a strong indicator of consuming misinformation, and experiencing exacerbated anxiety. We conduct a large-scale observational study spanning over 80 million Twitter posts made by 76,985 Twitter users during an 18.5 month period. The results from this study demonstrate that users who shared COVID-19 misinformation experienced approximately two times additional increase in anxiety when compared to similar users who did not share misinformation. Socio-demographic analysis reveals that women, racial minorities, and individuals with lower levels of education in the United States experienced a disproportionately higher increase in anxiety when compared to the other users. These findings shed light on the mental health costs of consuming online misinformation. The work bears practical implications for social media platforms in curbing the adverse psychological impacts of misinformation, while also upholding the ethos of an online public sphere.","output":"Examining the impact of sharing COVID-19 misinformation online on mental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Advancing age is a major risk factor for developing and dying from bloodstream infections (BSI). However, there is a paucity of population-based studies investigating the epidemiology of BSI in older persons. OBJECTIVE: To define the incidence, clinical determinants, and risk factors for death among those aged 65 years and older with BSI. METHODS: Population-based surveillance was conducted in the western interior of British Columbia, Canada, between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2020. Chart reviews were conducted for clinical details and all cause case-fatality was established at 30-days follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1854 incident BSI were identified among 1657 individuals aged 65 and older for an annual incidence of 533.9 per 100,000 population; the incidence for those aged 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years was 375.3, 678.9, and 1046.6 per 100,000 population, respectively. Males were at significantly increased risk as compared to females (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.44; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.32-1.59; p<0.0001). The crude annual incidence increased by 50% during the study. However, this was related to shift in population demographics with no increase evident following age- and sex-standardization. Older patients were more likely to have healthcare-associated infections and genitourinary sources and less likely to have bone/joint or soft tissue infections. The proportion of patients with underlying congestive heart failure, stroke, and dementia increased, whereas diabetes and liver disease decreased with older age. The overall 30-day all cause case-fatality rate was 22.0% (364/1657). After adjustment for clinical focus, onset of infection, etiology, and co-morbidity in a logistic model, those aged 75-84 years (odds ratio, OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.25-2.21) and &#8805; 85 years (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.41-2.77) were at significantly increased risk for death as compared to those aged 65-74 years. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is common in older persons and is a major cause of death. Countries with aging populations worldwide should expect an increase burden associated with BSI in the coming years.","output":"Burden of bloodstream infection in older persons: a population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, organisations have produced management guidance for cancer patients and the delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy, but none has offered estimates of risk or the potential impact across populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded case fatality rates, calculated the sex difference in survival and used data from four recent studies to convert case fatality rates into age/sex-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs). We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the risk-benefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01-46%). The risk was significantly higher with age and in men compared with women. 37.5% of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2018 had an IFR &#8805;5%. Survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from 5 to 10% in some common cancers, compared with the increased risk of death from COVID-19 of 0-3%. CONCLUSIONS: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19. Patients with cancer are also at a higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","output":"Estimating the Risk of Death from COVID-19 in Adult Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Health system responsiveness is defined as the outcome of designing health facility relationships so that they are familiar and responsive to patients' universally legitimate expectations. Even though different strategies have been implemented to measure responsiveness, only limited evidence exists in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, information about health system responsiveness among outpatients is limited. Assessing responsiveness could help facilities in improving service delivery based on patient expectations. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to assess health system responsiveness and associated factors among outpatients in primary health care facilities, Asagirt District, Ethiopia, 2021. METHODS Facility-based cross-sectional quantitative study was implemented between March 30 and April 30/2021. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to select 423 participants, and interviewer-administered data were collected using structured and pretested questionnaires. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were employed to identify factors associated with health system responsiveness. Adjusted Odds Ratio with their corresponding 95% CI was used to declare factors associated with health system responsiveness. A p-value less than 0.05 was used to declare significant statistical variables. RESULTS The overall health system responsiveness performance was 66.2% (95% CI: 61.4-70.7). Confidentiality and dignity were the highest responsive domains. Health system responsiveness was higher among satisfied patients (AOR: 9.9, 95% CI: 5.11-19.46), utilized private clinics (AOR: 8.8, 95% CI: 4.32-18.25), and no transport payment (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.03-2.92) in the study setting. CONCLUSION Overall, health system responsiveness performance was higher than a case-specific study in Ethiopia. To improve the health systems responsiveness and potentially fulfil patients' legitimate expectations, we need to facilitate informed treatment choice, provide reasonable care within a reasonable time frame, and give patients the option of consulting a specialist. Aside from that, enhancing patient satisfaction, using input from service users, Collaboration, and exchanging experiences between public and private facilities will be important interventions to improve HSR performance.","output":"Health system responsiveness and associated factors among outpatients in primary health care facilities in Ethiopia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious disease.

Despite their numerous advantages, however, CRISPR/Cas systems have some inherent limitations, such as off-target effects, unsatisfactory efficiency of delivery, and unwanted adverse effects, thereby resulting in a desire to explore approaches to address these issues. Strategies for improving the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas-induced mutations, such as reducing off-target effects, improving the design and modification of sgRNA, optimizing the editing time and the temperature, choice of delivery system, and enrichment of sgRNA, are comprehensively described in this review. Additionally, several newly emerging approaches, including the use of Cas variants, anti-CRISPR proteins, and mutant enrichment, are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the authors provide a deep analysis of the current challenges in the utilization of CRISPR/Cas systems and the future applications of CRISPR/Cas systems in various scenarios.

The number of incoming calls to the Youth Quitline and the participants' quit rate has increased since the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. Many participants (68%) did not realize that tobacco use potentially increased their risk for developing and spreading COVID-19; however, 43% agreed that the pandemic motivated their intention to quit, and 83% changed their smoking habits during the pandemic. These changes were mainly due to wearing masks (30%), closure of bars/pubs (25%), suspension of classes (14%), and being unable to socialize with friends (24%). Overall, 58% reduced their tobacco use; of these participants, 66% reported a &#8805;50% reduction in daily cigarette consumption. The participants reduced their smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic despite lacking knowledge about the potentially increased risk for contracting COVID-19 from continued smoking.

METHODS: U.S. adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the HeartlineTM clinical study were invited to complete a COVID-19 vaccine assessment through the HeartlineTM mobile application between November 6-20, 2020. Factors associated with willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using an ordered logistic regression as well as a Random Forest classification algorithm. RESULTS: Among 9,106 study participants, 81.3% (n = 7402) responded and had available demographic data. The majority (91.3%) reported a willingness to be vaccinated. Factors most strongly associated with vaccine willingness were beliefs about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general. Women and Black or African American respondents reported lower willingness to vaccinate. Among those less willing to get vaccinated, 66.2% said that they would talk with their health provider before making a decision. During the study, positive results from the first COVID-19 vaccine outcome study were released; vaccine willingness increased after this report. CONCLUSIONS: Even among older adults at high-risk for COVID-19 complications who are participating in a longitudinal clinical study, 1 in 11 reported lack of willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in November 2020. Variability in vaccine willingness by gender, race, education, and income suggests the potential for uneven vaccine uptake.

We compared the results with a cohort of similar patients treated during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 102 hip fractures were recorded in 2019, with a mean age of 85 years. 87.5% were treated surgically in our hospital, with mean waiting time of 4.6 days and mean stay of 11.3 days. In 2020, 107 hip fractures were recorded, with a mean age of 86 years. A total of 74.6% underwent surgery in our center, with a mean waiting time of 2.8 days and a mean hospital stay of 10.9 days. The rate of major complications and exitus was 8.9% and 6.7% respectively in 2019, and 9.4% and 7.8% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The number of hip fractures increased despite the declaration of the state of alarm in comparison with the decrease in the rest of the trauma emergencies.

The incidence and pathophysiology of these manifestations remain elusive. In this worldwide survey of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed cardiac arrhythmias, we describe clinical characteristics associated with various arrhythmias, as well as global differences in modulations of routine electrophysiology practice during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection worldwide with and without incident cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with documented atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrioventricular block, or marked sinus bradycardia (heart rate<40 bpm) were classified as having arrhythmia. Deidentified data was provided by each institution and analyzed. RESULTS: Data were collected for 4526 patients across 4 continents and 12 countries, 827 of whom had an arrhythmia. Cardiac comorbidities were common in patients with arrhythmia: 69% had hypertension, 42% diabetes, 30% had heart failure, and 24% had coronary artery disease. Most had no prior history of arrhythmia. Of those who did develop an arrhythmia, the majority (81.8%) developed atrial arrhythmias, 20.7% developed ventricular arrhythmias, and 22.6% had bradyarrhythmia. Regional differences suggested a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation in Asia compared with other continents (34% versus 63%). Most patients in North America and Europe received hydroxychloroquine, although the frequency of hydroxychloroquine therapy was constant across arrhythmia types. Forty-three percent of patients who developed arrhythmia were mechanically ventilated and 51% survived to hospital discharge.

With new viral variants continuously emerging and spreading rapidly, the effect of mutations on antigen test performance is a major concern. In response to the spread of variants the National Institutes of Healths Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx(R)) initiative created a Variant Task Force to assess the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on in vitro diagnostic testing. To evaluate the impact of mutations on rapid antigen tests we developed a lentivirus-mediated mammalian surface-display platform for the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, the target of the majority of rapid antigen tests. We employed deep mutational scanning (DMS) to directly measure the effect of all possible Nucleocapsid point mutations on antibody binding by 17 diagnostic antibodies used in 11 commercially available antigen tests with FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). The results provide a complete map of the antibodies epitopes and their susceptibility to mutational escape. This approach identifies linear epitopes, conformational epitopes, as well as allosteric escape mutations in any region of the Nucleocapsid protein. All 17 antibodies tested exhibit distinct escape mutation profiles, even among antibodies recognizing the same folded domain. Our data predict no vulnerabilities of rapid antigen tests for detection of mutations found in currently and previously dominant variants of concern and interest. We confirm this using the commercial tests and sequence-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. The antibody escape mutation profiles generated here serve as a valuable resource for predicting the performance of rapid antigen tests against past, current, as well as any possible future variants of SARS-CoV-2, establishing the direct clinical and public health utility of our system. Further, our mammalian surface-display platform combined with DMS is a generalizable platform for complete mapping of protein-protein interactions.","output":"Deep mutational scanning identifies SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid escape mutations of currently available rapid antigen tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic required the adoption of new technologies to improve access to healthcare at an unprecedented speed, as social distancing became mandatory.

For this, the most affected city by COVID-19 is considered, i.e., Mumbai, India, as a case study. It was found that Comorbidity is the most influential parameter on the Mortality of COVID-19. The Spearman correlation coefficient for meteorological parameters lies between 0.386 and 0.553, whereas for Comorbidity was found as 0.964. A regression model is developed using particle swarm optimization to predict the mortality cases for Mumbai, India. Further, the developed model is validated for the COVID-19 cases of Delhi, India, to emphasize the utility of the developed model for other cities. The measured and predicted curve shows a good fit with a mean percentage error of 0.00957% and a coefficient of determination of 0.9828.

RESULTS: A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years. The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe. The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics. CONCLUSION: The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.","output":"Counter-COVID- 19 pandemic strategy in the Maghreb Central.

The aim of this review is to investigate the role of surgical masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods - A literature research was conducted via PubMed to detect articles featuring the potential protective role of surgical masks when they were worn by healthcare workers or by the general public. Results - Among 114 articles, only 31 met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen additional articles provided useful information according to the aim of this review. Existing literature supports the positive effect of surgical masks on COVID-19 con-lamination. Debate on the efficacy of surgical masks compared with other forms of facial protective devices exists. There seems to be a tendency to favor the use of particulate-filtering facepiece respirators in healthcare professionals who face higher risk of infection. However, surgical masks primarily and cloth masks secondarily seem to be adequate means of protection for the general public and for healthcare workers during procedures where respiratory droplets are not generated. Rational use of surgical masks is imperative; however, reuse after decontamination is not ideal. Conclusions - For optimum protection from COVID-19, the use of surgical masks should be combined with other infection control measures like hand hygiene and social distancing, since the level of their effectiveness is still being investigated. Shortage of surgical masks should be prevented; therefore, rational use plays a crucial role in this direction.","output":"The Role of Surgical Masks during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, to a large health network in New Jersey with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, rapid testing, or serum immunoglobulin G testing; we included demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes. RESULTS A total of 81 patients 21 years old were admitted with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or serum immunoglobulin testing. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were admitted for management of acute COVID-19 infection, whereas 14 (17.3%) were admitted for management of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 81 hospitalized patients, 28 (34.6%) required intensive care. A majority of patients (42 [51.9%]) admitted for both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C were Hispanic. Underlying chronic health conditions were not present in most patients. Obesity (mean BMI of 41.1) was noted in the patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, although not statistically significant. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were statistically significant in the patients with MIS-C treated in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the growing literature of potential risk factors for severe disease in pediatric patients due to COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity represented the majority of patients with both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C, despite only representing 10% to 20% of the population our hospitals serve. Infants and patients with chronic health conditions were not at increased risk for severe disease.

Unfortunately, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary suspension of non-urgent elective surgery was implemented. Thousands of patients currently awaiting hip and knee replacements have been affected. Many of these patients will present to their general practitioners for symptom management during this interim period. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to summarise current recommendations for the non-operative management of patients with symptomatic OA. DISCUSSION Non-operative treatment modalities for OA include education, lifestyle modification and exercise, mass reduction, physiotherapy, orthoses, psychology, pharmaceuticals and injections. Multimodal therapy is required for patients with severe symptoms. A number of useful online resources are presented, as access to public allied health services may be limited because of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Symptom management for patients awaiting joint replacement surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the impact of COVID-19 is inordinately enormous, there remains a lack of attention to the new governance architecture, the African Union High-Level Task Force (AU-HLTF), in Africa's aviation and tourism sectors in its wake, which this paper primarily examines.

We recommend intensified dissemination of health worker tailor made tools for information, education and communication about the Covid 19 vaccine. The tools need to emphasize the elicited themes or motivators. We also recommend use of peers who have taken up the vaccine and survived Covid 19 or got a mild form of the disease to elicit positive peer influence about the vaccine amongst health workers.

Here, we quantitatively investigated the variation of air pollutants in China using long-term comprehensive data sets from 2013 to 2017, during which Chinese government made major efforts to reduce anthropogenic emission in polluted regions. Our results show a significant decreasing trend in the PM2.5 concentration in heavily polluted regions of eastern China, with an annual decrease of a7% compared with measurements in 2013. The measured decreased concentrations of SO2, NO2 and CO (a proxy for anthropogenic volatile organic compounds) could explain a large fraction of the decreased PM2.5 concentrations in different regions. As a consequence, the heavily polluted days decreased significantly in corresponding regions. Concentrations of organic aerosol, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and chloride measured in urban Beijing revealed a remarkable reduction from 2013 to 2017, connecting the decreases in aerosol precursors with corresponding chemical components closely. However, surface-ozone concentrations showed increasing trends in most urban stations from 2013 to 2017, which indicates stronger photochemical pollution. The boundary-layer height in capital cities of eastern China showed no significant trends over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions from 2013 to 2017, which confirmed the reduction in anthropogenic emissions.

The origin of coronaviruses and the risks of human-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-animal transmission of coronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level by detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid assembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV, Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In all coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer and shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect the recombination and co-infection as well.","output":"Evolving ribonucleocapsid assembly/packaging signals in the genomes of the human and animal coronaviruses: targeting, transmission and evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine may hold the key to ending the pandemic, but vaccine hesitancy is hindering the vaccination of healthcare personnel (HCP). We examined their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and implemented an intervention to increase vaccination uptake. DESIGN: Before-and-after trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Healthcare personnel at a 790-bed tertiary-care center in Tokyo, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: A prevaccination questionnaire was administered to HCP to examine their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine. A multifaceted intervention was then implemented involving (1) distribution of informational leaflets to all HCP, (2) hospital-wide announcements encouraging vaccination, (3) a mandatory lecture, (4) an educational session about the vaccine for pregnant or breastfeeding HCP, and (5) allergy testing for HCP at risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A postvaccination survey was also performed. RESULTS: Of 1,575 HCP eligible for enrollment, 1,224 (77.7%) responded to the questionnaire, 533 (43.5%) expressed willingness to be vaccinated, 593 (48.4%) were uncertain, and 98 (8.0%) expressed unwillingness to be vaccinated. The latter 2 groups were concerned about the vaccines safety rather than its efficacy. After the intervention, the overall vaccination rate reached 89.7% (1,413 of 1,575), and 88.9% (614 of 691) of the prevaccination survey respondents answered unwilling to or unsure about eventually receiving a vaccination. In the postvaccination questionnaire, factors contributing to increased COVID-19 vaccination included information and endorsement of vaccination at the medical center (274 of 1,037, 26.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This multifaceted intervention increased COVID-19 vaccinations among HCP at a Japanese hospital.

Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 95% CI: 24%C50%), brain fog (32%, 9%C55%), memory issues (27%, 18%C36%), attention disorder (22%, 10%C34%), myalgia (18%, 4%C32%), anosmia (12%, 7%C17%), dysgeusia (11%, 4%C17%) and headache (10%, 1%C21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%C43%), anxiety (23%, 13%C33%) and depression (12%, 7%C21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced frequency of anosmia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4C2.3). Cohorts with >20% of patients admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 experienced higher prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances than cohorts with <20% of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory issues, attention disorder) and sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) are common and increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.","output":"Mid and long-term neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen La neumona causada por coronavirus, que se origin en Wuhan, China, a finales de 2019, se ha extendido por todo el mundo convirtindose en una pandemia. Desafortunadamente, a da de hoy no existe ninguna vacuna especfica para el virus COVID-19, y el tratamiento est siendo de soporte con a?adido de antivirales y otros frmacos, sin que hasta la fecha se haya evidenciado un beneficio claro. Muchos de estos pacientes se deterioran rpidamente y requieren ser intubados y ventilados mecnicamente, lo que est provocando el colapso del sistema sanitario en muchos pases debido a la falta de ventiladores y de camas de crticos. En este documento revisamos dos terapias adyuvantes sencillas de aplicar, sin efectos deletreos y de un coste bajo que podran ser de utilidad para el tratamiento de la infeccin por coronavirus agudo severo asociado al sndrome respiratorio agudo (SARS-CoV-2). La vitaminaC, un potente antioxidante, se ha convertido en una terapia relevante debido a sus beneficios potenciales cuando se administra por va intravenosa. El efecto potencial de la vitaminaC en la reduccin de la inflamacin en los pulmones podra desempe?ar un papel clave en la lesin pulmonar causada por la infeccin por coronavirus. Otra posible terapia eficaz es el ozono. Pese a la controversia que siempre le ha acompa?ado, se ha estudiado y utilizado ampliamente durante muchos a?os y su eficacia se ha demostrado en mltiples estudios. Sin embargo, nuestro objetivo no es hacer una revisin exhaustiva de dichas terapias sino difundir sus efectos beneficiosos. Obviamente, los ensayos clnicos son necesarios, pero dado el potencial beneficio de estas terapias, recomendamos incorporarlas al arsenal teraputico para el tratamiento del SARS-CoV-2. Abstract Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","output":"Dos terapias conocidas podran ser efectivas como adyuvantes en el paciente crtico infectado por COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robert McLean and John Gargani tackle one of these thorny issues in I Scaling Impact: Innovation for the Public Good i .

Studies published in English by 27th March, 2020 with original data were included. Primary outcomes included comorbidities of COVID-19 patients, their symptoms presented on hospital admission, laboratory results, radiological outcomes, and pharmacological and in-patient treatments. 76 studies were included in this meta-analysis, accounting for a total of 11,028 COVID-19 patients in multiple countries. A random-effects model was used to aggregate estimates across eligible studies and produce meta-analytic estimates. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (18.1%, 95% CI 15.4C20.8%). The most frequently identified symptoms were fever (72.4%, 95% CI 67.2C77.7%) and cough (55.5%, 95% CI 50.7C60.3%).

In addition to Ca2+ signaling, STIM1 is also involved in regulation of the type I IFN (IFN-I) response. To examine their potential role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we generated ORAI1 and STIM1 knockout human HEK293-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cells and checked their responses. STIM1 knockout cells showed strong resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection as a result of enhanced IFN-I response. On the contrary, ORAI1 deletion induced high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mechanistically, ORAI1 knockout cells showed reduced homeostatic cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and severe impairment in tonic IFN-I signaling. Transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of multiple antiviral signaling pathways in ORAI1 knockout cells, likely because of reduced expression of the Ca2+-dependent transcription factors of the AP-1 family and MEF2C Accordingly, modulation of homeostatic Ca2+ concentration by pretreatment with ORAI1 blocker or agonist could influence baseline IFNB expression and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human lung epithelial cell line.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. These findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples (n = 9). Apart from the lung, correlation of viral detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 and its replication could be observed across all organ systems, which co-localizes with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells.

Numerous reports have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes depletion of B- and T-lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and is associated with severe illness and death and that patients with higher lymphocyte levels may have better outcomes. Dexamethasone, a widely prescribed antiemetic for acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from a variety of cancer drugs, causes B and T cell depletion, which may augment immunosuppression. Since it seems that lymphocytes are vital in the immune response to novel coronavirus, oncologists should reconsider the routine use of prophylactic dexamethasone in uninfected patients, to avoid inducing lymphopenia, which may increase risk of infection or lead to inferior outcomes if a cancer patient subsequently becomes infected. Since many cancer drugs and malignant diseases inherently cause lymphopenia, further reduction of lymphocytes with dexamethasone should be avoided if possible and if safe and effective alternative antiemetics are available during the COVID-19 crisis.","output":"Routine antiemetic prophylaxis with dexamethasone during COVID-19: Should oncologists reconsider?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The newly identified betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative pathogen of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) that killed more than 3.5 million people till now.

This work uses a rational computational strategy to identify the existing drug molecules to target host pathways to reduce the cytokine storm. RESULTS: We used a host response signature network consist of 36 genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with cytokine storm. In order to attenuate the cytokine storm, potential drug molecules were searched against host response signature network. Our study identified that drug molecule andrographolide, naturally present in a medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, has the potential to bind with crucial proteins to block the TNF-induced NFkB1 signaling pathway responsible for cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. The molecular docking method showed the binding of andrographolide with TNF and covalent binding with NFkB1 proteins of the TNF signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: We used a rational computational approach to repurpose existing drugs targeting host immunomodulating pathways.

Preterm births contribute upto 10% of all births and incur significant impact on the child health and cost to the health care system. However, the association of city lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic with the rate of preterm births is unclear. In a cohort study, we examined the association of city lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic with the births at different gestations in three different cities. Compared with the pre-pandemic epoch, the associative relationships ranged from a decrease in all births, all births across all preterm gestations and to preterm births in moderately and late preterm gestations. We concluded that there were variable associative relationships of city lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic with preterm births.

The first aim of the current exploratory study was to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Dutch adolescents mood, empathy, and prosocial behavior in the first weeks of lockdown. Longitudinal analyses comparing pre-pandemic measures to a three-week peri-pandemic daily diary study showed (i) decreases in empathic concern, opportunities for prosocial actions, and tension, (ii) stable levels of social value orientation, altruism, and dire prosociality, and (iii) increased levels of perspective taking and vigor during the first weeks of lockdown. The second aim was to investigate peri-pandemic effects of familiarity, need, and deservedness on giving behavior by utilizing novel hypothetical Dictator Games with ecologically valid targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents showed higher levels of giving to a friend (a familiar other, about 51% of the total share), a doctor in a hospital (deserving target, 78%), and individuals with COVID-19 or a poor immune system (targets in need, 69 and 63%, respectively) compared to an unfamiliar peer (39%). We also tested moderating effects of empathy, contributions to society, and opportunities for prosocial actions on giving. Individuals who showed higher levels of empathic concern, gave more to others, regardless of target.

However, there are contradictory reports describing OATP1B expression in hepatocytes and liver biopsies after administration of an inducer. This study investigated the in vivo effects of the common inducer rifampin (RIF) on the activity and expression of cynomolgus monkey OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, which are structurally and functionally similar their human OATP1B counterparts. Multiple doses of oral RIF (15 mg/kg) resulted in a steady 3.9-fold increase of CYP3A biomarker, 4?-hydroxycholesterol (4?HC), in the plasma samples collected before each RIF dose during the treatment period (i.e., predose). In contrast, the predose plasma levels of OATP1B biomarkers coproporphyrin (CP) I and CPIII did not change when compared to RIF treatment. The trough concentration, AUC, and half-life of RIF decreased markedly during RIF treatment, suggesting that RIF induced its own clearance. Consequently, RIF treatment increased CPI and CPIII AUCs substantially after a single administration and, to a lesser extent, after multiple administrations, compared to pre-administration AUCs. In addition, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mRNA expressions were not modulated by RIF treatment (0.85- to 1.3-fold) whereas CYP3A8 expression was increased 3.7- to 5.0-fold, which correlated well with the predose levels of CP and 4?HC. Rifampin treatment showed 2.0- to 3.3-fold increases in P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 expression in the small intestine. Collectively, these findings indicate that monkey OATP1B and OATP1B3 are not induced by RIF and further investigation of OATP1B induction by RIF and other nuclear receptor activators in humans is warranted. Significance Statement In this study, combined endogenous biomarker and gene expression data suggested that RIF did not induce OATP1B in cynomolgus monkeys. For the first time, the study determines transporter gene expression in the nonhuman primate liver, gut, and kidney tissues following administration of RIF for 7 days, leading to a better understanding of the induction of OATP1B and other major drug transporters. Finally, it provides evidence to strengthen the claim that CP is a suitable endogenous probes of OATP1B activity.","output":"Absence of OATP1B Induction by Rifampin in Cynomolgus Monkeys: Determination Using the Endogenous OATP1B Marker Coproporphyrin and Tissue Gene Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The area of covalent inhibitors is gaining momentum due to recently introduced clinical drugs, but libraries of these compounds are scarce.

We synthesized factors hypothesized to drive the pace and burden of this pandemic in SSA during the period from 25 February to 20 December 2020, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare capacity, intervention efforts and human mobility dimensions. Large diversity in the probable drivers indicates a need for caution in interpreting analyses that aggregate data across low- and middle-income settings. Our simulation shows that climatic variation between SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories; however, heterogeneity in connectivity, although rarely considered, is likely an important contributor to variance in the pace of viral spread across SSA. Our synthesis points to the potential benefits of context-specific adaptation of surveillance systems during the ongoing pandemic.

One of the approaches is to test for significant difference in expression between treatment and control separately in the two groups, and then select genes that show statistical significance in one group only. This approach is then often combined with a gene set enrichment analysis to find pathways and gene sets regulated by treatment in only this group. Here we show that this procedure is statistically incorrect and that the interaction between treatment and group should be tested instead. Moreover, we show that gene set enrichment analysis applied to such incorrectly defined genes group-specific genes may result in misleading artifacts. Due to the presence of false negatives, genes significant in one, but not the other group are enriched in gene sets which correspond to the overall effect of the treatment. Thus, the results appear related to the problem at hand, but do not reflect the group-specific effect of a treatment. A literature search revealed that more than a quarter of papers which used a Venn diagram to illustrate the results of separate differential analysis have also applied this incorrect reasoning.","output":"Venn Diagrams May Indicate Erroneous Statistical Reasoning in Transcriptomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of vaccines against biothreat toxins like ricin (RT) is considered an integral component of the United States national security efforts. RiVax? is a thermostable, lyophilized RT subunit vaccine adsorbed to aluminum salt adjuvant intended for use by military personnel and first responders. Phase 1 studies indicated that RiVax is safe and immunogenic, while a three dose, intramuscular vaccination regimen in non-human primates elicited protection against lethal dose RT challenge by aerosol. Here we investigated, in a mouse model, the durability of RiVax-induced antibody responses and corresponding immunity to lethal dose RT challenge. Groups of mice were subcutaneously administered 3 or 1 g of RiVax on days 0 and 21 and challenged with 10  LD50 RT by injection at six different intervals over the course of twelve months. Serum antibody titers and epitope-specific competition assays were determined prior to each challenge. We report that the two-dose, 3 g regimen conferred near complete protection against RT challenge on day 35 and complete protection thereafter (challenge days 65, 95, 125, 245, and 365). The two-dose, 3 g regimen was superior to the 1 g regimen as revealed by slight differences in survival and morbidity scores (e.g., hypoglycemia, weight loss) on challenge days 35 and 365. In separate experiments, a single 3 g RiVax vaccination proved only marginally effective at eliciting protective immunity to RT, underscoring the necessity of a prime-boost regimen to achieve full and long-lasting protection against RT. IMPORTANCE Ricin toxin (RT) is a notorious biothreat, as exposure to even trace amounts via injection or inhalation can induce organ failure and death within a matter of hours. In this study, we advance the preclinical testing of a candidate RT vaccine known as RiVax?. RiVax is a recombinant non-toxic derivative of RTs enzymatic subunit that has been evaluated for safety in Phase I clinical trials and efficacy in a variety of animal models. We demonstrate that two doses of RiVax is sufficient to protect mice from lethal dose RT challenge for up to one year. We describe kinetics and other immune parameters of the antibody response to RiVax and discuss how these immune factors may translate to humans.","output":"Durable Immunity to Ricin Toxin Elicited by a Thermostable, Lyophilized Subunit Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The spread of epidemics resulting in many deaths has been known since the dawn of civilization, for example, the typhus and smallpox epidemics and the plague Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV) Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts","output":"[the Psychological Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health - Literature Review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rare antibody that is able to tolerate physio-chemical factors is preferred and highly demanded in diagnosis and therapy. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies (RmAbs) are distinguished owing to their high affinity and stability. However, the efficiency and availability of traditional methods for RmAb discovery are limited, especially for small molecules. Here, we present an indirect competitive screening method in nanowells, named CSMN, for single rabbit antibody secreting cells (ASCs) selection with 20.6 h and proposed an efficient platform for RmAb production against small molecule with 5.8 days for the first time. Chloramphenicol (CAP) as an antibacterial agent has the great threats for public health. We applied the CSMN to select CAP-specific ASCs and produced one high affinity RmAb, surprisingly showing extremely halophilic properties with an IC50 of 0.08 ng mL-1 in saturated salt solution which has as yet not been shown by other antibodies. Molecular dynamic simulation showed that the negatively charged surface improved the stability of the RmAb structure with additional disulfide bonds compared with mouse antibody. Moreover, the reduced solvent accessible surface area of the binding pocket increased the interactions of RmAb with CAP in a saturated salt solution. Furthermore, the RmAb was used to develop an immunoassay for the detection of CAP in real biological samples with simple pretreatment, shorter assay time, and higher sensitivity. The results demonstrated that the practical and efficient CSMN is suitable for rare RmAb discovery against small molecules.","output":"Rare Monoclonal Antibody Discovery Based on Indirect Competitive Screening of Single Hapten-specific Rabbit Antibody Secreting Cell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In this large multi-institutional study, we aimed to analyze the prognostic power of computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics models in COVID-19 patients. Methods: CT images of 14,339 COVID-19 patients with overall survival outcome were collected from 19 medical centers. Whole lung segmentations were performed automatically using a previously validated deep learning-based model, and regions of interest were further evaluated and modified by a human observer. All images were resampled to an isotropic voxel size, intensities were discretized into 64-binning size, and 105 radiomics features, including shape, intensity, and texture features were extracted from the lung mask. Radiomics features were normalized using Z-score normalization. High-correlated features using Pearson (R2>0.99) were eliminated. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOT) algorithm in only the training set for different models to overcome unbalance classes. We used 4 feature selection algorithms, namely Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis (KW), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Relief. For the classification task, we used seven classifiers, including Logistic Regression (LR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), Naive Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were built and evaluated using training and testing sets, respectively. Specifically, we evaluated the models using 10 different splitting and cross-validation strategies, including different types of test datasets (e.g. non-harmonized vs. ComBat-harmonized datasets). The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were reported for models evaluation. Results: In the test dataset (4301) consisting of CT and/or RT-PCR positive cases, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.83(sd:0.01) (CI95%: 0.81-0.85), 0.81, and 0.72, respectively, were obtained by ANOVA feature selector + RF classifier. In RT-PCR-only positive test sets (3644), similar results were achieved, and there was no statistically significant difference. In ComBat harmonized dataset, Relief feature selector + RF classifier resulted in highest performance of AUC, reaching 0.83 (sd:0.01) (CI95%: 0.81-0.85), with sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. At the same time, ComBat harmonization did not depict statistically significant improvement relevant to non-harmonized dataset. In leave-one-center-out, the combination of ANOVA feature selector and LR classifier resulted in the highest performance of AUC (0.80 (sd:0.084)) with sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 (sd:0.11) and 0.76 (sd: 0.075), respectively. Conclusion: Lung CT radiomics features can be used towards robust prognostic modeling of COVID-19 in large heterogeneous datasets gathered from multiple centers. As such, CT radiomics-based model has significant potential for use in prospective clinical settings towards improved management of COVID-19 patients.","output":"COVID-19 Prognostic Modeling Using CT Radiomic Features and Machine Learning Algorithms: Analysis of a Multi-Institutional Dataset of 14,339 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) infection affects the swine industry.

METHODS: A survey instrument was developed around the priorities identified in the context of the COVID-19 and Dementia Task Force convened by the Alzheimer Society of Canada. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were analyzed. Overall, respondents were able to access information that was helpful for maintaining their own health and managing a period of social distancing. Care partners reported a number of serious concerns, including the inability to visit the person that they care for in long-term or palliative care. Participants also reported that the pandemic increased their levels of stress overall and that they felt lonelier and more isolated than they did before the pandemic. The use of technology was reported as a way to connect socially with their loved ones, with the majority of participants connecting with others at least twice per week.

Many social restrictions have been imposed to slow the spread, such as quarantine practices, curfews, restrictions on travel between countries / cities, restrictions on collective activities and social distance practices. In our country, formal education was suspended by the Higher Education Council and it was recommended that all processes including assessment and evaluation be carried out online. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the psychological effects of Sleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine students due to the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: 607 students gave opinions for the study (n=607). Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Test was preferred in the study because it was preferred in international studies. RESULTS: Students' mean GAD-7 score was calculated as 10.243.95. 3 (0.5%) of the students were mild, 339 (55.8) were moderate, 168 (27.7%) were high and 97 (16%) were in serious anxiety. The average of anxiety of preclinical students (10.504.06) was calculated to be higher than the clinical period students (9.803.72) and a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups (p=0.028). 61 of the participants (10%) had COVID-19 positivity in themselves or in their relatives. The average of the students who had COVID-19 positivity in themselves or their close environment (11.374.34) was higher than the students who did not (10.123.89), and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.034). In our cross-sectional descriptive study, students' GAD-7 mean score was 10.243.95, which shows that students of Sleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine also had high prevalent anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 epidemic, in line with the current literature.

BACKGROUND: Headache is one of the most frequent neurological symptoms reported in case series, epidemiological studies, and meta-analyses of COVID-19, with a prevalence ranging from 8 to 71.1%. Studies addressing the semiology of these headaches are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital. Patients classified according to the Manchester Triage System as standard and non-urgent and those fulfilling the criteria for probable or confirmed COVID-19 according to World Health Organization guidelines who presented with headache were included. A standardized questionnaire was used for data collection. RESULTS: Of the 145 confirmed and probable COVID-19 patients, 99 (68.3%) reported headache. A total of 54/99 (54.5%) were classified with probable COVID-19 and 45/99 (45.5%) with confirmed COVID-19. The mean age (44.7  11.8 vs 40.4  10.7, P = .061), sex distribution (35/54 [64.8%] vs 28/45 [62.2%] female, P = .768), and headache comorbidity (19/54 [35.2%] vs 17/45 [37.8%], P = .789) were similar between the probable and confirmed COVID-19 groups, along with other medical comorbidities and laboratory data.

In most cases, the headache appeared simultaneously with other COVID-19 symptoms (57/99, 57.6%). It was bilateral (86/99, 86.9%), frontal or holocranial (34/99, 34.3% each) in location and intense (60/99, 60.6%, reported a visual analog scale [VAS] score &#8805;7). A total of 39/99 (39.4%) identified triggers, most commonly fever. The most frequent aggravating factors were physical activity (45/99, 45.5%) and coughing (43/99, 43.4%). Patients showed a propensity toward prostration (41/99, 41.4%), photophobia (29/99, 29.3%), and phonophobia (27/99, 27.3%). Partial (53/99, 53.5%) or total (26/99, 26.3%) responses to first-step analgesics were reported. A total of 25/99 (25.3%) patients had a prior history of migraine, presenting with headache different from the usual in 23/25 (92.0%) patients.

METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated adults at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus between 2005 and 2012, who had had available TSH concentrations within the 6 months before noncardiac surgery. Patients were categorized as (1) hypothyroid (patients who had diagnosis of hypothyroidism any time prior to surgery and increased TSH value (> 5.5 mIU/L) within 6 months prior to surgery); (2) treated (hypothyroid diagnosis and normal TSH concentrations [0.4-5.5 mIU/L]); and (3) euthyroid (no hypothyroid diagnosis and normal TSH concentrations). We conducted pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups using inverse propensity score weighting to control for observed confounding variables. Average relative effect generalized estimating equation model was used for the primary outcome composite of in-hospital cardiovascular morbidity, surgical wound complication or infection, and mortality. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used for secondary outcomes of intraoperative vasopressor use and duration of hospitalization, respectively. RESULTS We identified 800 hypothyroid patients (median TSH: 8.6 mIU/L [Q1, Q3: 6.5, 13.0]), 1805 treated patients (2.0 mIU/L [1.1, 3.2]), and 5612 euthyroid patients (1.7 mIU/L [1.1, 2.6]). There were no significant differences among the hypothyroid, treated, and euthyroid patients on the primary composite outcome (all P values 0.30). Hypothyroid patients were slightly more likely to receive vasopressor during surgery than either treated (odds ratio, 1.17; 99.2% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.36) or euthyroid (odds ratio, 1.12; 99.2% CI, 1.02-1.24) patients. Furthermore, hypothyroid patients were slightly but significantly less likely to be discharged at any given postoperative time than treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.92; 99.2% CI, 0.86-0.99).

RESULTS: The study population comprised of 414 patients. Fever, respiratory symptoms, and dyspnea were the most frequent COVID-19-related symptoms, and 81.4% of them had pneumonia. More than one-third of patients showed digestive symptoms at diagnosis, combinations of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most patients were hospitalized, 12.1% in intensive care units, and 17.6% needed ventilator support. Treatment for COVID-19 included frequently hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, high-dose steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab. After a mean follow-up of 44 days, the fatality rate was 26.3%.

A multi-antigen approach requiring partial agreement between RBD and N or S1 readouts (RBD&N|S1 rule) was less affected by cut-off selection, resulting in robust seroprevalence estimation [0.6% (95% CI 0.3-1.1%)-1.2% (95% CI 0.7-2.0%)] and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals.","output":"Accurate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys require robust multi-antigen assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of sleep-wake rhythm disruption on neuromuscular control and muscle fatigue has received little attention. Because nurse shift work is so varied, including overnight duty, rotating shift schedules, early awakening, and interrupted nocturnal sleep, it offers an interesting model to study this paradigm. It has been investigated so far using only subjective markers. A combined approach based on the simultaneous analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) and force signals can objectively detect possible deficits in neuromuscular control and muscle fatigue. With this study we investigated neuromuscular activation and muscle contraction capacity at submaximum and maximum level in nurses working two night-shift schedules and compared them to levels in nurses working entirely in day shifts. Sleep quality and activity levels were also assessed. The study sample was 71 nurses grouped by their shift work schedule: night shift for 5 days (NS5, n = 46), night shift for 10 days (NS10, n = 9), and only day/swing shift (DS, n = 16). Before and after the shift-work cycle, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force and muscle activation, neuromuscular control, and muscle fatigability were measured in the finger flexor muscles. Activity level and sleep quality during the shift-work cycle were recorded with a wrist actigraph. After the shift-work cycles, MVC force and muscle activation were decreased (-11  3% and -33  3%, p < 0.001) as was neuromuscular control (-36  8%, p = 0.007), whereas muscle fatigability was increased (+ 19  9%, p = 0.006) in the NS5 and the NS10 group. Sleep quality was lower in the NS5 and the NS10 group (-8  1.8% and -15%3, respectively, p < 0.001), while the activity level for the three groups was similar. There was a clear reduction in neuromuscular control and an increase in muscle fatigue in the nurses working the night shift. These findings may inform of work schedule planning or recommendations for devising new recovery strategies to counteract neuromuscular alterations in night shift nurses.","output":"Reduced Neuromuscular Performance in Night Shift Orthopedic Nurses: New Insights From a Combined Electromyographic and Force Signals Approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During virus infection, multiple immune signaling pathways are triggered, both within the host cell and bystander cells of an infected tissue. These pathways act in concert to mediate innate antiviral immunity and to initiate the inflammatory response against infection. The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicase proteins that can identify viral RNA as nonself via binding to pathogen associated molecular patter (PAMP) motifs within RNA ligands that accumulate during virus infection. This interaction then leads to triggering of an innate antiviral response within the infected cells through RLR induction of downstream effector molecules such as type I interferon (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that serve to induce antiviral and inflammatory gene expression within the local tissue. Cellular regulation of RLR signaling is a critical process that can direct the outcome of infection and is essential for governance of the overall immune response and avoidance of immune toxicity. Mechanisms of positive and negative regulation of RLR signaling have been identified that include signaling crosstalk between RLR pathways and Nuclear Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-Like Receptor (NLR) pathways and Caspase networks. Furthermore, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to target these pathways to promote enhanced replication and spread within the host. These virus-host interactions therefore carry important consequences for host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Understanding the pivotal role of RLRs in immune regulation and signaling crosstalk in antiviral immunity may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the control of virus infection and immunity.","output":"RIG-I Like Receptors and Their Signaling Crosstalk in the Regulation of Antiviral Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused higher educational institutions around the world to close campus-based activities and move to online delivery The aim of this paper is to present the case of Global College of Engineering and Technology (GCET) and how its practices including teaching, students/staff support, assessments, and exam policies were affected The paper investigates the mediating role of no detriment policy impact on students result along with the challenges faced by the higher educational institution, recommendations and suggestions The investigation concludes that the strategies adopted for online delivery, student support, assessments and exam policies have helped students to effectively cope with the teaching and learning challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic without affecting their academic results The study shows that 99% of students were able to maintain the same or better level of performance during the 1st COVID-19 semester One percent of students had shown a slight decrease in their performance (about 1%C2%) with respect to their overall marks pre-COVID-19 The no detriment policy has succoured those 1% of the students to maintain their overall performance to what it used to be pre-COVID-19 pandemic Finally, the paper provides the list of challenges and suggestions for smooth conduction of online education","output":"COVID-19 and Learning Styles: GCET as Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Microscopic surgery is currently considered the gold standard for middle-ear, mastoid and lateral skull base surgery.

In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions.

With the epicentre of the outbreak projected to shift to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after making significant impact in China, Europe, USA, and South America, it is necessary for countries in this region to begin to plan for how to tackle a rapid surge in cases. Health facilities are already being primed for increased presentation of COVID-19 cases. As countries prepare, they also need to consider how non-urgent services will not be interrupted. Estimates of a potential disruption in access to long and short acting contraceptives for up to 12 months will result in an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies and additional 28,000 maternal deaths. Thus, effort must be made to ensure that the gains made in SRH outcomes over several years are not lost.

Furthermore, we aimed to determine the ideal frequency of training sessions for an optimal retention and the value of debriefing. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, WoS, ERIC, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library conducted through August 1, 2018. All primary studies mentioning NTS in ALS education were included. Three reviewers independently extracted data on study design and outcome. The MERSQI approach was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. Results Of the 10,723 identified articles, 40 studies were included with a combined total of 3,041 participants, ranging from students to experts. Depending on the focus of the study, articles were categorized in NTS (n = 25), retention (n = 8), and feedback (n = 10). Incorporating NTS during ALS simulation showed significant improvements in timing for performing critical first steps. Furthermore, good leadership skills had a favorable effect on overall technical performance and teamwork during simulation improved team dynamics and performance. Finally, debriefing also had a beneficial effect on team performance. One particular type of debriefing does not appear to be superior to other types of debriefing. Conclusion Team simulation training resulted in improved NTS and a reduction in the time required to complete a simulated cardiac arrest. Therefore, a formal NTS program should be introduced into ALS courses. Feedback and repetitive practice are key factors to train NTS. The impact of training on team behaviors can persist for at least 3 to 6 months. In conclusion, understanding and improving NTS may help to create more effective teams.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce a spatially explicit metapopulation model for rabies diffusion in Central African Republic. Calibrated on epidemiological data for the capital city, Bangui, the model predicts that long-range movements are essential for continuous re-introductions of rabies-exposed dogs across settlements, eased by the large fluctuations of the incubation period. Banguis neighborhood, instead, would not be enough to self-sustain the epidemic, contrary to previous expectations.

The aim of this study was to examine the managerial and clinical challenges of nurse managers in mental health centers during the current COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study based on an analysis of data obtained in focus groups with 25 nurse managers from two mental health centers in Israel. METHODS: The quantitative phase was conducted prior to the group sessions using a structured self-administered questionnaire that examined the nurse managers' (a) background data, (b) communication with the staff nurses, (c) perceptions of nurses' functioning, (d) perceptions of their own functioning, and (e) management as impacted by the pandemic. The qualitative phase included three sessions of focus groups in which the nurse managers discussed both their challenging and positive issues during the pandemic. FINDINGS: The most important challenges were related to the need to protect patients from infection and communicating with families and primary caregivers. Work policies and procedures were less well adapted to pandemic conditions; nevertheless, nurse managers felt a sense of purpose, duty, and pride in their work. Three themes emerged: (a) \\"management complexity\\" included the change from a familiar routine to a new reality, working in capsules, protecting against infection, functional confusion, and insights into future epidemics; (b) \\"challenging communication\\" included communication with patients through glass walls and communication with staff through screens and (c) \\"bright spots\\" referred to staff cohesion and the provision of respectful care. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health nurse managers have experienced during the pandemic a change in their roles from being less managerial to focusing more on clinical work. Communication between nurse managers and staff nurses and between mental health patients and staff were the main challenges. Nurse managers favorably noted the uniformity and humanity of the staff, sense of cohesion, and shared responsibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the first wave of the pandemic, there was confusion as to the functional role of ward nurse managers, as the focus of their activities became more clinical and less managerial. During and after the pandemic, preventive interventions should be carried out in order to assist patients, staff nurses, and nurse managers in mental health centers.","output":"A Mixed-Methods Study of Nurse Managers' Managerial and Clinical Challenges in Mental Health Centers During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on causes of mortality through multiple methodological approaches.

Both the underlying cause of death (UCOD), and all diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death) were investigated; a further analysis was carried out through a simulation where the UCOD was selected after substituting ICD-10 codes for COVID with unspecified pneumonia. RESULTS: Overall 10,222 deaths were registered in March-April 2020, corresponding to a 24% increase compared to the previous two years. COVID-19 was mentioned in 1,444 certificates, and selected as the UCOD in 1,207 deaths. Based on the UCOD, the increases in mortality were observed for COVID and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. Multiple causes of death and the simulation analysis demonstrated further increases in mortality related to dementia/Alzheimer and chronic lower respiratory diseases.

Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","output":"Using Internet-Based Psychological Measurement to Capture the Deteriorating Community Mental Health Profile During COVID-19: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Average gestation length in domestic cats is 65.6 days, with a range of 52C74 days.

Clinical Case: A 78-year-old Filipino female sought consult due to a rapidly progressive anterior neck mass. This started as a centimeter-sized nodule initially noted three months prior. Two months after, there was gradual enlargement to a fist-size, movable mass, hard in consistency associated with dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. On consult, neck ultrasound revealed an enlarged right thyroid with a mass in the right lobe (TI-RADS 5), multinodular with no lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, a CT scan of the neck was done to evaluate for other structural causes of dysphagia showing no intrathoracic extension. Patient was advised surgery but was lost to follow up due to lockdown from COVID-19. In the interim, patient was admitted for aspiration pneumonia. IV antibiotics were initiated and urgent surgery was advised to relieve patient of respiratory compromise. Patient was airlifted to a tertiary care center for further management. Baseline thyroid function tests were normal. Repeat neck imaging showed interval increase in the hypodense mass measuring 6x9x8 cm (from 3x4x5 cm) (APxWxCC) extending to the hypopharynx and laryngeal vestibule with mass effect to the trachea and esophagus. A multidisciplinary meeting was done to establish goals of care. On the 3rd hospital day, a tracheostomy with incisional biopsy and frozen section was done which revealed round to spindle cell neoplasm with anaplastic features. No further surgical resection was done and specimen was sent for immunohistochemical staining. Long term enteral access was secured during the same operation. Final histopathology showed undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma with anaplastic features and no definite lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemical markers were negative for CD3, CD20, Thyroglobulin, TTF-1, PAX8, Calcitonin and Pancytokeratin which reveal loss of tumor antigenicity, consistent with the histopathologic diagnosis. Metastatic work-up revealed varisized pulmonary, subpleural and hepatic nodules with lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Patient was staged as IVC (T4N1M1). Patient was referred for radiation to maximize local control, to complete 33 fractions of 200 cGy on the thyroid mass and received one cycle of Paclitaxel before discharge. Concurrent chemoradiation was continued and completed 29 cycles of radiation and 2 cycles of Paclitaxel which significantly reduced the tumor size. However, the patient succumbed to acute coronary syndrome on her third admission. Conclusion: There is currently no consensus first-line treatment modality available worldwide.

In 2016C2017, three lynx from the same geographical area were found seropositive for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in the framework of an international translocation program. This novel finding raised questions about the virus origin and pathogenicity to lynx, the emerging character of the infection, and the interpretation of serological results in other lynx caught for translocation. Archived serum samples from 84 lynx captured in 2001C2016 were retrospectively tested for FIV antibodies by Western blot. All archived samples were FIV-negative. The three seropositive lynx were monitored in quarantine enclosures prior to euthanasia and necropsy. They showed disease signs, pathological findings, and occurrence of co-infections reminding of those described in FIV-infected domestic cats. All attempts to isolate and characterize the virus failed but serological data and spatiotemporal proximity of the cases suggested emergence of a lentivirus with antigenic and pathogenic similarities to FIV in the Swiss lynx population. A decision scheme was developed to minimize potential health risks posed by FIV infection, both in the recipient and source lynx populations, considering conservation goals, animal welfare, and the limited action range resulting from local human conflicts. Development and implementation of a cautious decision scheme was particularly challenging because FIV pathogenic potential in lynx was unclear, negative FIV serological results obtained within the first weeks after infection are unpredictable, and neither euthanasia nor repatriation of multiple lynx was acceptable options. The proposed scheme distinguished between three scenarios: release at the capture site, translocation, or euthanasia. Until April 2021, none of the 40 lynx newly captured in Switzerland tested FIV-seropositive. Altogether, seropositivity to FIV was documented in none of 124 lynx tested at their first capture, but three of them seroconverted in 2016C2017. Diagnosis of FIV infection in the three seropositive lynx remains uncertain, but clinical observations and pathological findings confirmed that euthanasia was appropriate. Our experiences underline the necessity to include FIV in pathogen screenings of free-ranging European wild felids, the importance of lynx health monitoring, and the usefulness of health protocols in wildlife translocation.","output":"Management of Suspected Cases of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx) During an International Translocation Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout its 40-year history, the field of gene therapy has been marked by many transitions.

At the heart of this dichotomous field are the viral-based vectors, the delivery vehicles that have allowed researchers and clinicians to develop powerful drug platforms, and have radically changed the face of medicine. Within the past 5 years, the gene therapy field has seen a wave of drugs based on viral vectors that have gained regulatory approval that come in a variety of designs and purposes. These modalities range from vector-based cancer therapies, to treating monogenic diseases with life-altering outcomes. At present, the three key vector strategies are based on adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and lentiviruses. They have led the way in preclinical and clinical successes in the past two decades. However, despite these successes, many challenges still limit these approaches from attaining their full potential.

Previous studies have shown that in ultrasound imaging, 90% of BI-RADS 4A tumors are benign lesions after biopsies. Unnecessary biopsy procedures can be avoided by accurate classification of BIRADS 4A tumors. However, the classification task is challenging and has not been fully investigated by existing studies. For benign and malignant tumors of BI-RADS 4A, the appearances of intra-class tumors are highly-variable, the characteristics of inter-class tumors is overall-similar. Discriminative features need to be found to improve classification accuracy of BI-RADS 4A tumors. METHODS: In this study, we designed the network using the clinical features of BI-RADS 4A tumors to improve the discrimination ability of network. The boundary information is embedded into the input of the network using the uncertainty. A fine-grained data augmentation method is used to find discriminative features in tumor information embedded with boundary information. Two mathematical methods, voting-based and variance-based, are used to define the uncertainty of boundary, and the differences of these two definitions are compared in a classification network. RESULTS: The dataset we used to evaluate our method had 1155 2D gray-scale images. Each image represented a unique BI-RADS 4A tumor. Among them, 248 tumors were proven to be malignant by biopsy, and the remaining 907 were benign. A weakly supervised data augmentation network (WS-DAN) was used as the backbone classification network, which showed competitive performance in finding discriminative features. Using the auxiliary input of the uncertain boundaries defined by the voting method, the area under the curve (AUC) value of our method was 0.8347 (sensitivity = 0.7774, specificity = 0.7459). The AUC value of the variance-based uncertainty was 0.7789. The voting-based uncertainty was higher than the baseline (AUC = 0.803), which only inputs the original image. Compared with the classic classification network, our method had a significant effect improvement (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Using the uncertain boundaries defined by the voting methods as auxiliary information, we obtained a better performance in the classification of BI-RADS 4A ultrasound images, while variance-based uncertain boundaries had no effect on improving classification performance.

The methodology used consists of estimating a panel of the nine main destinations of the Tunisian migrants in Europe between 1997 and 2017. The empirical results show that the main factors explaining the decision to emigrate are the economic factors related mainly to the income differential, the demographic factors related to the differential age structure of the origin and host populations, and the cultural factors linked basically to the language mastery. Indeed, the migrant stocks are one of the main determinants of the remittances to Tunisia. But there are other variables that do not lack importance such as the economic conditions linked by the host countries. This shows that Tunisian migrants react more to economic conditions in European countries than in Tunisia. The economic situation of European countries dominates the number of emigrants as an explanatory factor for the amount of transfers from Tunisian emigrants. Similarly, the results confirm that an increase in remittances significantly reduces the demand for employment and therefore increases the unemployment rate. This positive correlation reveals that the impact of demographic changes on the effect of remittances occurs through an increase in unemployment due to the aging of the population, which coincides with the case of Tunisia going through a demographic transition period.","output":"Remittances and Labor Supply: Evidence from Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was the evaluation of the hormonal response of wheelchair rugby participants under the half-year training cycle.

Data on daily confirmed cases, together with weather parameters, were collected from the first day of COVID confirmed cases in each country to 31 August 2020. The weather parameters were Rainfall (mm), relative humidity (%), maximum and minimum temperature (C), surface pressure (kpa), maximum air pollutants matter PM 2.5 (g/m3) and maximum wind speed (m/s). Data were analyzed for each investigated countries separately by using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables (ARIMAX) model. We found that maximum wind speed had significant negative impact on COVID-19 transmission in India (-209.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): -369.13, -49.77) and Sri Lanka (-2.77, 95% CI: -4.77, -0.77). Apart from India, temperature had mixed effects (i.e., positive or negative) in four countries in South Asia. For example, maximum temperature had negative impact (-30.52, 95% CI: -60.24, -0.78) in Bangladesh and positive impact (5.10, 95% CI: 0.06, 10.14) in Afghanistan.

We compared outcomes of patients with refractory ARDS from COVID-19 and Influenza placed on ECMO. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with refractory ARDS due to COVID-19 or Influenza placed on ECMO at two referral centers from 1/2013 to 10/2020. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared. The primary endpoint was survival to discharge. Results Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were similar. During the study period, 53 patients with COVID-19 and 67 patients with Influenza were supported. Veno-venous ECMO was the predominant initial cannulation strategy in both groups (COVID 92.5% vs Influenza 95.5%; p=0.5). Survival to hospital discharge was 62.3% (33/53 patients) in the COVID-19 group and 64.2% (43/67) in the Influenza group (p=0.8). In patients successfully decannulated, median length of time on ECMO was longer in COVID-19 patients (14 days [IQR 9-30] vs. Influenza 10.5 [IQR 6.8-14.3] days, p=0.004). Among patients discharged alive, COVID-19 patients had longer overall length of stay (COVID 37 [IQR 27-62] vs Influenza 13.5 [IQR 9.3-24] days; p=0.007). Conclusions In patients with refractory ARDS from COVID-19 or Influenza placed on ECMO, there was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge.

Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Comparative analysis of ACE2 protein expression in rodent, non-human primate, and human respiratory tract at baseline and after injury: a conundrum for COVID-19 pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Once the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in New York City (NYC), stay-at-home orders led to more time spent indoors, potentially increasing exposure to secondhand marijuana and tobacco smoke via incursions from common areas or neighbors. The objective of this study was to characterize housing-based disparities in marijuana and tobacco incursions in NYC housing during the pandemic. DESIGN: We surveyed a random sample of families from May to July 2020 and collected sociodemographic data, housing characteristics, and the presence, frequency, and pandemic-related change in incursions. SETTING: Five pediatric practices affiliated with a large NYC health care system. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 230 caregivers of children attending the practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and change in tobacco and marijuana smoke incursions. RESULTS: Tobacco and marijuana smoke incursions were reported by 22.9% and 30.7%, respectively. Twenty-two percent of families received financial housing support (public housing, Section-8). Compared with families in private housing, families with financial housing support had 3.8 times the odds of tobacco incursions (95% CI, 1.4-10.1) and 3.7 times the odds of worsening incursions during pandemic (95% CI, 1.1-12.5). Families with financially supported housing had 6.9 times the odds of marijuana incursions (95% CI, 2.4-19.5) and 5 times the odds of worsening incursions during pandemic (95% CI, 1.9-12.8). Children in financially supported housing spent more time inside the home during pandemic (median 24 hours vs 21.6 hours, P = .02) and were more likely to have asthma (37% vs 12.9%, P = .001) than children in private housing. CONCLUSIONS: Incursions were higher among families with financially supported housing. Better enforcement of existing regulations (eg, Smoke-Free Public Housing Rule) and implementation of additional policies to limit secondhand tobacco and marijuana exposure in children are needed. Such actions should prioritize equitable access to cessation and mental health services and consider structural systems leading to poverty and health disparities.","output":"Disparities in Marijuana and Tobacco Smoke Incursions Among New York City Families During Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has affected patients of all ages and demographics, not excluding pregnant women.

For the chronic phase, the main concerns are the development of pulmonary interstitial disease and/or lingering cardiovascular involvement. How to intercept, assess, and treat these patients with long-term consequences of COVID-19 remains uncertain. PURPOSE: We aimed to determine: 1) functional capacity of COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2) those characteristics associated with CPET performance; 3) safety and tolerability of CPET. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 discharged alive at a single hospital in northern Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed. RESULTS: From 225 patients discharged from March to November 2020 we excluded 12 incomplete/missing cases, and 13 unable to perform CPET leading to a final population of 200 patients. At PFT all median parameters were within normality range. Median percent-predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 88% (78.3C103.1). Ninety-nine (49.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 101 (50.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Sixteen (16.2%) patients had respiratory, 28 (28.9%) cardiac, 21 (21.2%) mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 34 (34.3%) non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. One-hundred sixty (80.0%) patients complain at least one symptom, without relationship with peakVO2. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in one-second (=5.29, p=0.023), percent-predicted diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide (=6.31, p=0.001), and DLE maximal strength (=14.09, p=0.008) independently associated with peakVO2. At sensitivity analysis, the results of previous multivariate linear regression analysis were also similar among sub-groups of patients with no previous significant disease in anamnesis (cardiovascular disease except for arterial hypertension, respiratory disease, kidney disease, or cancer) and of those with a length of hospital stay 7 days. None major event was reported during/after CPET, whereas only two cases (1.0%) had a mild symptomatic hypotension post exercise. None of the involved health professionals developed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: CPET after COVID-19 is safe and about 1/3rd of COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, calling for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.

Methods and results : We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0).

Total exports showed a considerable increase from 2008, reaching their highest historical volume in 2019 (33,948 metric tons dry weight plus 3 metric tons of fresh/frozen weight). China dominated the market by importing 90% of the total Peruvian production of seaweeds. A low percentage of the exports (3%) corresponded to red seaweeds (mainly Chondracanthus chamissoi for industrial use). Export volumes of C. chamissoi have been decreasing since 2015, however prices have continued to increase. Brown seaweeds accounted for 97% of the exports. These were dominated by Lessonia berteroana until 2007 and then by Macrocystis pyrifera. The latter showed the highest overall growth rate (47%). Wet biomass estimations showed a gap between the data reflecting what is officially harvested versus what is actually exported. This unreported biomass might reflect the governments lack of control of seaweed harvesting.

We therefore sought to determine whether the timing of diagnosis and treatment and the postoperative outcome of patients with testicular torsion had been changed during the COVID pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS We considered all patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for testicular torsion from February 2018 to August 2019 (pre-COVID period) and from February 2020 to August 2021 (during COVID pandemic). All patients underwent clinical and ultrasound evaluation and subsequently scrotal exploration. Primary outcomes were the time differences from pain onset to ED presentation and from ED presentation to surgical treatment. We also investigated whether the number or orchiectomies required changed during the pandemic. RESULTS A total of 54 patients were divided in two groups: 40 patients in pre-COVID-19 group and 14 in the COVID-19 cohort. Mean time from symptoms onset to ED access was longer during the pandemic (4.2  5.7 versus 39.6  37.3 hours, p = 0.009). Mean time from ED access to surgery was similar (2.9  1.1 versus 4.2  2.3, p = 0.355). In addition, the number of orchiectomies was higher in COVID-19 group (2.5% versus 28.6%, p < 0.01), compared to a lower number of detorsions (97.5% versus 71.4%, p < 0.01). Elapsed time from pain onset to surgery was directly correlated with the increased white blood cell (WBC) count after surgery (r = 0.399, p = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The current study identifies a significant delay in presentation of testicular torsion which resulted in a significant increase in orchiectomies with the expected decreased in detorsion/orchiopexy.

Using agent-based simulations, we analyze the outbreak process for different combinations of the spatial parameters (alignment strength and Peclet number) and epidemic parameters (infection-lifetime transmissibility and duration of the individual infectious period). We show that the emerging spatial features strongly affect the contagion process. The ordered homogeneous states greatly disfavor infection spreading, due to their limited mixing, only achieving large outbreaks for high values of the individual infectious duration. The disordered homogeneous states also present low contagion capabilities, requiring relatively high values of both epidemic parameters to reach significant spreading. Instead, the inhomogeneous ordered states display high outbreak levels for a broad range of parameters. The formation of bands and clusters in these states favor infection propagation through a combination of processes that develop inside and outside of these structures. Our results highlight the importance of self-organized spatiotemporal features in a variety of contagion processes that can describe epidemics or other propagation dynamics, thus suggesting new approaches for understanding, predicting, and controlling their spreading in a variety of self-organized biological systems, ranging from bacterial swarms to animal groups and human crowds.","output":"Contagion dynamics in self-organized systems of self-propelled agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcome of octogenarians with covid-19.

The rapid transmission dynamics and high morbidity and mortality that occur in SNFs emphasize the need for early detection of cases. We hypothesized that residents of SNFs infected with SARS-CoV-2 would demonstrate an acute change in either temperature or oxygen saturation (SpO2) prior to symptom onset. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) conducted a retrospective analysis of both temperature and SpO2 at two separate SNFs to assess the utility of these quantitative markers to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the development of symptoms. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of 165 individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were residents in in SNFs that experienced COVID-19 outbreaks during April-June 2020 in a metropolitan area of Minnesota. Age, sex, symptomology, temperature and SpO2 values, date of symptom onset and date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test were analyzed. Temperature and SpO2 values for the period 14 days before and after date of initial positive test were included. Descriptive analyses evaluated changes in temperature and SpO2, defined as either exceeding a set threshold or demonstrating an acute change between consecutive measurements. RESULTS Two (1%) residents had a temperature value 100o F, and 30 (18%) had at least one value 99o F within 14 days before symptom development. One hundred and sixteen residents (70%) had at least one SpO2 value 94% while 131 (80%) had an acute decrease in SpO2 of 3% between consecutive values in the 14 days prior to symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that acute change in SpO2 might be useful in identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the development of symptoms among residents living in SNFs. Facilities may consider adding SpO2 to daily temperature and symptom screening checklists to improve early detection of residents of SNFs infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Temperature and Oxygen Saturation in SNF Residents Positive for SARS-CoV-2 Prior to Symptom Onset."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Excluding superimposed enteric infection is critical in acute severe ulcerative colitis management. Whilst infection with Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus have been shown to increase colectomy and mortality rates, no data exists regarding the impact of common viral enteropathogens in acute severe ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to determine if viral enteric infection in acute severe ulcerative colitis alters the severity or outcomes of these episodes. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of cases presenting to a large tertiary centre. Data was obtained from an in-house, prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database. We identified all acute severe ulcerative colitis cases treated between October 2015 and January 2021 and compared those testing positive for Adenovirus 40/41, human Rotavirus or Norovirus GI by faecal multiplex polymerase chain reaction to those testing negative. RESULTS: We identified 147 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis and faecal multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing for viral pathogens. 22/147 patients (14.9%) tested positive, two of whom tested positive for two viruses. Infected and non-infected cohorts did not differ significantly with regards to admission C-reactive protein (81.7 vs. 76.6, p=0.77), Mayo endoscopic subscore (2.4 vs. 2.3, p=0.43), length of hospital admission (7.9 vs. 7.9 p=0.99), requirement for rescue therapy (59% vs. 56%, p=0.75) or colectomy rate (4.5% vs. 4.1%, p=0.69).

The objective of this study was to systematically review of the effects of AAIs on the mental and cognitive health outcomes of higher education students. Methods: Randomized controlled trials using any unfamiliar animal as the sole intervention tool were included in the systematic review. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Where possible, effect sizes (Hedges g) were pooled for individual outcomes using random-effects meta-analyses. Albatross plots were used to supplement the data synthesis. Results: Of 2.401 identified studies, 35 were included. Almost all studies used dogs as the intervention animal. The quality of most included studies was rated as moderate. Studies showed an overall reduction of acute anxiety (g= -0.57 (95%CI -1.45;0.31)) and stress. For other mental outcomes, studies showed an overall small reduction of negative affect (g= -0.47 (95%CI -1.46;0.52)), chronic stress (g= -0.23 (95%CI -0.57;0.11)) and depression, as well as small increases in arousal, happiness and positive affect (g= 0.06 (95%CI -0.78;0.90)). Studies showed no effect on heart rate and heart rate variability, a small reduction in salivary cortisol and mixed effects on blood pressure. No effect on cognitive outcomes was found. Conclusion: Overall, evidence suggests that AAIs are effective at improving mental, but not physiological or cognitive outcomes of students.

We compared speech produced with and without the different masks on acoustic measures of timing, frequency, perturbation and power spectral density. Speech clarity was also examined using a standardized intelligibility tool by blinded raters. Mask type impacted the power distribution in frequencies above 3kHz for both the N95 and surgical masks. Measures of timing and spectral tilt also differed across mask conditions. Cepstral and harmonics to noise ratios remained flat across mask type. No differences were observed across conditions for word or sentence intelligibility measures.

In this study, mercury contamination was investigated in brown booby (Sula leucogaster) adults and juveniles during their breeding season at the Santana Archipelago, on the southeast coast of Brazil. Two hypotheses were evaluated: 1. As females consume larger prey than males due to the reverse sexual dimorphism, higher total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations are expected in females tissues than in males; 2. Adult seabirds have more time to accumulate mercury than juveniles, so it is expected that adults will show higher THg and MeHg concentrations than juveniles in their feathers, but none in blood since the last indicates the exposure of short time (30-60 days), as it is a constantly synthesized tissue. Feathers and blood were sampled from 20 individuals of each group (males, females and juveniles). Also, 10 eggs of the brown booby and muscle tissue samples of their main prey were collected, from February to October 2018. Females and males had similar THg concentrations in the tissues with no statistical differences between sexes. Thus, the sexual size dimorphism did not influence mercury concentrations among the tissues and both genders can be used as a biomonitor. Brown booby juveniles had low THg and MeHg concentrations compared to adults due to a shorter time of exposure for mercury to bioaccumulate in their tissues.

METHODS A literature search of MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Included studies reported outcomes related to RTP (time and rate), durability and player participation, and player performance following AT rupture in professional athletes of the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and professional soccer leagues. RESULTS Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. Athletes were able to return to professional sport participation 76% of the time, with mean time to RTP of 11 months following AT injury. Athletes experienced a decline in player efficiency ratings, power ratings, and sport- and position-specific statistics in the NFL, NBA, and professional soccer leagues compared to noninjured controls. RTP rate was significantly lower following AT rupture in comparison to athletes sustaining other common orthopaedic injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament injuries, meniscal tears, and ankle fractures in both NFL and NBA athletes. CONCLUSIONS AT rupture prohibits nearly 25% of professional athletes from returning to their respective sport. Of those able to return to compete at a professional level, the mean time to RTP is 11 months-nearly double the estimated 6-month recovery for RTP in the general population. Furthermore, player performance and durability were curtailed following AT rupture.

Primary outcome was treatment strategy used for acute appendicitis. RESULTS: This study includes 2002 children treated for acute appendicitis of a median age of 10 (range 1-15) years and 605 children from a similar data set pre pandemic from 2017. In the pandemic cohort 560/2002(28%) were initially treated non-operatively of whom 125/560(22%) proceeded to appendicectomy within initial hospital admission. Non-operative treatment wasn't used in the pre-pandemic cohort. Diagnostic imaging use was greater during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (54vs31%; p<0.00001) but overall use of laparoscopy was similar during both time periods (62.4vs66.6%). Hospital readmission rate was lower (8.7vs13.9%; p=0.0002) during the pandemic than pre-pandemic and reintervention rate was similar (2.9vs2.6%;p=0.42).

Remdesivir has been granted approvals in several countries for use in adults and children hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Inside the cell, remdesivir undergoes metabolic activation to form the intracellular active triphosphate metabolite, GS-443902 (detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells), and ultimately, the renally eliminated plasma metabolite GS-441524. This review discusses the pre-clinical pharmacology of RDV, clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics/concentration-QT analysis, rationale for dose selection for treatment of patients with COVID-19, and drug-drug interaction potential based on available in vitro and clinical data in healthy volunteers. Following single-dose intravenous administration over 2 h of an RDV solution formulation across the dose range of 3-225 mg in healthy participants, RDV and its metabolites (GS-704277and GS-441524) exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. Following multiple doses of RDV 150 mg once daily for 7 or 14 days, major metabolite GS-441524 accumulates approximately 1.9-fold in plasma. Based on pharmacokinetic bridging from animal data and available human data in healthy volunteers, the RDV clinical dose regimen of a 200-mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100-mg maintenance doses for 4 or 9 days was selected for further evaluation of pharmacokinetics and safety. Results showed high intracellular concentrations of GS-443902 suggestive of efficient conversion from RDV into the triphosphate form, and further supporting this clinical dosing regimen for the treatment of COVID-19. Mathematical drug-drug interaction liability predictions, based on in vitro and phase I data, suggest RDV has low potential for drug-drug interactions, as the impact of inducers or inhibitors on RDV disposition is minimized by the parenteral route of administration and extensive extraction. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, RDV is not predicted to be a clinically significant inhibitor of drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters in patients infected with COVID-19 at therapeutic RDV doses.","output":"Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Drug-Interaction Profile of Remdesivir, a SARS-CoV-2 Replication Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The first case of COVID-19 in Sweden was diagnosed in late January 2020, the first recommendations against the spread of the virus were released in mid-March, and the peak of the first wave of the pandemic was reached in March-June.

Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples, thus definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID-19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID-19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection. Viral interactions may utilise membrane receptors other than ACE-2 thus, tissue susceptibility may be broader than currently known.

In some countries, the point has been reached at which the demand for such resources, including donor blood, outstrips the supply. Questions as to the safety of blood persist. Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined. As options dwindle, we must enact regional and national shortage plans worldwide and more vitally disseminate the knowledge of and immediately implement patient blood management (PBM). PBM is an evidence-based bundle of care to optimize medical and surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing and preserving a patients own blood.

DesignWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted a real-world cohort study using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform. SettingPatient-level electronic health record data were obtained from 24 million people registered with a general practice in England that uses TPP software. The primary care data were securely linked with data on COVID-19 infection and therapeutics, hospital admission and death within the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform, covering a period where both medications were frequently prescribed in community settings. ParticipantsNon-hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients at high-risk of severe outcomes treated with sotrovimab or molnupiravir between December 16, 2021 and February 10, 2022. InterventionsSotrovimab or molnupiravir administered in the community by COVID-19 Medicine Delivery Units. Main outcome measureCOVID-19 related hospitalisation or COVID-19 related death within 28 days after treatment initiation. ResultsPatients treated with sotrovimab (n=3288) and molnupiravir (n=2663) were similar with respect to most baseline characteristics. The mean age of all 5951 patients was 52 (SD=16) years; 59% were female, 89% White and 87% had three or more COVID-19 vaccinations. Within 28 days after treatment initiation, 84 (1.4%) COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were observed (31 treated with sotrovimab and 53 with molnupiravir). Cox proportional hazards models stratified by area showed that after adjusting for demographics, high-risk cohort categories, vaccination status, calendar time, body mass index and other comorbidities, treatment with sotrovimab was associated with a substantially lower risk than treatment with molnupiravir (hazard ratio, HR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.88; P=0.014). Consistent results were obtained from propensity score weighted Cox models (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.83; P=0.007) and when restricted to fully vaccinated people (HR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.90; P=0.020). No substantial effect modifications by other characteristics were detected (all P values for interaction>0.10). ConclusionIn routine care of non-hospitalised high-risk adult patients with COVID-19 in England, those who received sotrovimab were at lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes than those receiving molnupiravir. What is already known on this topicTwo phase 3 randomised controlled trials in unvaccinated non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients who were at high risk of progression to severe disease or death showed a strong efficacy of sotrovimab for preventing hospitalisation or death (relative risk reduction by 79%) and a modest efficacy of molnupiravir (relative risk reduction by 30%). No randomised controlled trial comparing these medications has been conducted and evaluations of their effectiveness when used in routine care are limited. It remains unclear whether their effectiveness persists in vaccinated populations, patients infected by the Omicron variant, and other subgroups underrepresented in clinical trials. What this study addsFollowing the concurrent rollout of sotrovimab and molnupiravir in community settings in England between December 16, 2021 and February 10, 2022, we were able to make direct comparisons of their effectiveness using near real-time electronic health record data. This real-world cohort study demonstrated that among non-hospitalised high-risk COVID-19 adult patients in England, those receiving sotrovimab were at substantially lower risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes than those receiving molnupiravir. This study generalises findings from the randomised controlled trials to vaccinated populations and the Omicron variant, and provides supportive evidence for the current clinical guideline which prioritises sotrovimab over molnupiravir in non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","output":"Comparative effectiveness of sotrovimab and molnupiravir for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes in non-hospitalised patients: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the beginning of 2021, the battle against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains ongoing.

We enrolled 38 participants in this study. 7 healthy participants and 31 COVID-19 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and categorized them into 3 groups according to their previous clinical presentations: 10 moderate, 9 mild, and 12 asymptomatic. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral lymphocyte counts in recovered patients showed significantly increased levels of CD4+ T cells in patients with a history of mild and moderate COVID-19 symptoms compared with those healthy individuals (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively). whereas no significant difference was observed in the CD8+ T cell percentage in COVID-19-recovered patients compared with healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-S) IgG antibody production could be observed in all recovered COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic (p < 0.05)or presented with mild (p < 0.0001) or moderate symptoms (p < 0.01) .

This study aims to describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with PIMS in Mexico City. Methods: this was an observational study (May 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021) of children with PIMS according to Centers of Disease Control and Prevention case definition criteria, hospitalized in a single tertiary care pediatric center in Mexico City. Demographic characteristics, epidemiological data, medical history, laboratory tests, cardiology evaluations, treatment, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Seventy-five cases fulfilled case-definition criteria for PIMS (median age 10.9 years, IQR: 5.6-15.6). Fifteen (20%) had a severe underlying disease. Forty-eight cases (64%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 33 (44%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 39 (52%) received vasopressor support. Two distinct groups of patients were identified: cluster 1 (n=60) who had rash or gastrointestinal symptoms and cluster 2 (n=15) with predominantly respiratory manifestations. Two cases (2.7%) died, both with severe underlying conditions. Five cases (6.7%) developed coronary aneurysms, all of them from cluster 1. Conclusion: clinical manifestations and outcomes are in general comparable what has been previously reported in international series. In our series, there was a high proportion of patients with severe respiratory involvement and positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 and a low frequency of coronary aneurysms which suggests a possible higher proportion of children with severe acute COVID-19 in our included cases.","output":"Characteristics and outcomes of cases of children and adolescents with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in a tertiary care centre in Mexico City."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The spread of the novel COVID-19 virus has raised many questions on the performance of the national and global healthcare systems.

Pre-clinical and human studies evidence a relationship between oxidative stress (OS) biomarkers in depression symptoms, and an influence of biological factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), but focus has been clinical or younger samples, and less is known about patterns in healthy older adults. We investigated these associations with data derived from the Australian Research Council Longevity Study (ARCLI; ANZCTR12611000487910), in 568 healthy adults aged 60C75 years using F(2)-Isoprostanes plasma levels, and controlling for demographic factors, in assessing mood via the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and General Health Questionnaire 12. Elevated F(2)-Isoprostanes contributed to depressed mood on the BDI-II and reduced general health on the GHQ-12. BMI was positively associated with Chalder Fatigue scores, yet better ratings on the GHQ-12. Females had significantly higher F(2)-Isoprostanes than males. The results suggest that in otherwise healthy older adults, mood and mental health are reduced with increases in oxidative stress markers, exhibiting similar patterns observed in clinical groups. Sex as a factor should be considered when assessing OS levels in systemic pathologies.

Urinary exosomes, tiny vesicles released into the urine that carry parent cells' proteins and nucleic acids, reflect the biologic function of the parent cells within the kidney, including immune cells. Their stability in urine makes them a potentially powerful tool for liquid biopsy and a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for kidney-transplant rejection. METHODS Using 192 of 220 urine samples with matched biopsy samples from 175 patients who underwent a clinically indicated kidney-transplant biopsy, we isolated urinary exosomal mRNAs and developed rejection signatures on the basis of differential gene expression. We used crossvalidation to assess the performance of the signatures on multiple data subsets. RESULTS An exosomal mRNA signature discriminated between biopsy samples from patients with all-cause rejection and those with no rejection, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98), which is significantly better than the current standard of care (increase in eGFR AUC of 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.65). The exosome-based signature's negative predictive value was 93.3% and its positive predictive value was 86.2%. Using the same approach, we identified an additional gene signature that discriminated patients with T cell-mediated rejection from those with antibody-mediated rejection (with an AUC of 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97). This signature's negative predictive value was 90.6% and its positive predictive value was 77.8%. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that mRNA signatures derived from urinary exosomes represent a powerful and noninvasive tool to screen for kidney allograft rejection.

According to the conventional understanding of world history, the historical process to modernity that has led to the Civil Revolution, Scientific Revolution, and Capitalism is linear and universally inevitable, and this-in other words, Eurocentrism-implies that only the historical experiences of Europeans are relevant. This mainstream view of world history has spread the dichotomous analytic framework of historiography and reinforced cultural essentialism, which has eventually given a Euro- or Sino-centric hierarchical presentation of history. This type of world view rests on the assumption that there are intrinsic and incommensurable differences between cultures or localities, which a lot of commentators and scholars have constantly countered by arguing that that presumption does not comply with what historical sources say. Drawing on some trail-blazing scholarship of cultural studies and others, this essay turns away from this \\"conventional\\" framework of historiography and presents a world view that is framed in the context of trans-locality, interconnectedness, plurality, heterogeneity, polycentricity, and diversity. In recent years, in an attempt to search for new analytic frames, some endeavors have emerged in the field of cultural or science studies to go beyond just providing critical commentaries or case studies. Furthermore, researchers and scholars in the history of science, technology and medicine in East Asia have put an effort into conceptualizing and establishing such new analytic frames. Among those approaches are attempts to shed light upon the trans-local yet global interconnectedness (emphatically in pre-modern periods), diverse historical trajectories to modernities, and polycentric as well as plural landscape of scientific enterprises over time and across the world. On top of these new visions of world history, this essay further elaborates on and proposes some conceptive ideas: (1) \\"Tradition\\" as a set of recipes, which could replace the idea of the living yet dead tradition; (2) \\"Medicine\\" as a problem-solving activity, which calls more attention to historical actors of East Asian medicine; (3) \\"East Asian medicines\\" as a family of trans-locally related practices in East Asia, which would lead to going beyond the nationalist historiography such as Sino-centrism; (4) \\"Problematique\\" as the system of questions and concepts which make up East Asian medicine, which should reveal what East Asian medicines have been about; (5) \\"Styles of Practice\\" for the historiography of East Asian medicines, as opposed to the cultural account, epistemological historiography or praxiography; and, as an illustrative example, (6) \\"Topological Bodies\\" for the history of anatomy in East Asia.

Data analyzed included operative time, morbidity, quality of life (QOL), cosmetic result, and global patient satisfaction. The last three parameters were evaluated 3 months after surgery. QOL was assessed with the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire. Cosmetic result and patient satisfaction were rated using a 5-grade Likert scale. RESULTS This study included 104 patients operated on between April and June 2010. A SILC was performed in 35 patients and a CLC in 69. The preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar. Median operative time for SILC was higher than that for CLC: 55 versus 40 min (p < 0.001). Postoperative complications (0 vs. 2) and postoperative GIQLI scores (123  13 vs. 121  18) were not significantly different between groups. Cosmetic result and patient satisfaction were better for SILC than for CLC. The percentages of results rated as excellent were 68 versus 37 % (p < 0.006) and 80 versus 57 % (p < 0.039), respectively. For the whole group, multivariate statistical analysis revealed that postoperative GIQLI score and cosmetic result were independent predictive factors of patient satisfaction. The percentages of satisfaction rated as excellent were greater in patients who had a postoperative GIQLI score 130 (92 vs. 49 %, odds ratio [OR] = 4, p < 0.001) and in patients who had an excellent cosmetic result (82 vs. 47 %, OR = 7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Compared to CLC, SILC is associated with a longer operative time, an equivalent morbidity and QOL, and a better cosmetic result.

Lockdowns influence contact among persons within or between populations including restricting travel, closing schools, prohibiting public gatherings, requiring workplace closures, all designed to slow the contagion of the virus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of lockdown measures on the spread of covid-19 and test a theoretical model of the covid-19 pandemic employing structural equation modelling. METHODS: Lockdown variables, population demographics, mortality rates, infection rates, and health were obtained for eight countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The dataset, owid-covid-data.csv, was downloaded on 06/01/2020 from: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. Infection spread and mortality data were depicted as logistic growth and analyzed with stepwise multiple regression. The overall structure of the covid-19 data was explored through factor analyses leading to a theoretical model that was tested using latent variable path analysis. RESULTS: Multiple regression indicated that the time from lockdown had a small but significant effect ( = 0.112, p< 0.01) on reducing the number of cases per million. The stringency index produced the most important effect for mortality and infection rates ( = 0.588, = 0.702,  = 0.518,  = 0.681; p< 0.01). Exploratory and confirmatory analyses resulted in meaningful and cohesive latent variables: 1) Mortality, 2) Infection Spread, 3) Pop Health Risk, and 4) Health Vulnerability (Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.08). DISCUSSION: The stringency index had a large impact on the growth of covid-19 infection and mortality rates as did percentage of population aged over 65, median age, per capita GDP, diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular death rates, and ICU hospital beds per 100K. The overall Latent Variable Path Analysis is theoretically meaningful and coherent with acceptable fit indices as a model of the covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of the stringency of lockdown measures on covid-19: A theoretical model of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the development of service robots.

Wearable devices may provide the opportunity to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness outside of the laboratory, without breaking self-isolation;herein, we explore the feasibility of this approach. Fifteen healthy participants were tested every 2 weeks for 10 weeks during a reduction of containment measures after a strict lockdown. Physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). V.O2peak was estimated through a previously validated test based on the speed of a 60 m sprint run, the baseline-to-peak heart rate (HR) variation, and the velocity of HR decay after the sprint, and measured through a wearable HR monitor.

The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat.

However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage.

It has long been suggested that bats may be more tolerant of viral infection than other mammals due to their unique immune system, but the exact mechanism remains to be fully explored. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple animal species were diseased by SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the respiratory system. Herein, single-cell transcriptomic data of the lungs of a horseshoe bat, a cat, a tiger, and a pangolin were generated. The receptor distribution of twenty-eight respiratory viruses belonging to fourteen viral families were characterized for the four species. Comparison on the immune-related transcripts further revealed limited cytokine activations in bats, which might explain the reason why bats experienced only mild diseases or even no symptoms upon virus infection.

Because bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin) contamination is known to cause spontaneous cytokine production by monocytes, contamination of blood collection tubes may interfere with biomarker assay results. METHODS Whole blood from healthy donors was collected into plastic or glass sodium (Na(+))-heparin Vacutainer() blood collection tubes and heparinized syringes. Samples were analyzed for phosphoprotein response, cytokine production, and RNA expression. Tubes were tested for endotoxin contamination by use of the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. RESULTS Results of phospho-flow cytometry, branched DNA (bDNA), and ELISA assays indicated that a specific lot (#5339582) of plastic Na(+)-heparin Vacutainer tubes was highly contaminated with an endotoxinlike substance, and contamination was confirmed by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Analysis of multiple-analyte panels revealed that analytes whose changed expression was predictive of LPS stimulation were increased when whole blood was incubated in contaminated tubes for 6 or 18 h. Two additional lots of plastic tubes tested had detectable amounts of endotoxin sufficient to strongly alter phospho-flow cytometry analyses, as determined by the fold change in phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha and LPS. In contrast, 3 lots of glass tubes had substantially lower levels of spontaneous blood activation. CONCLUSIONS Endotoxin contamination associated with tubes from 3 lots of a particular type of plastic Na(+)-heparin Vacutainer tube dramatically affected biomarker assay measurements.

Carotid CTA is a routine acute stroke investigation and includes the lung apices. We evaluated CTA as a potential COVID-19 diagnostic imaging biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study (n = 225) including CTAs of patients with suspected acute stroke from 3 hyperacute stroke units (March-April 2020). We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of candidate diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Demographics, clinical features, and risk factors for COVID-19 and stroke were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: Apical ground-glass opacification was present in 22.2% (50/225) of patients. Ground-glass opacification had high interrater reliability (Fleiss &#954; = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95) and, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, had good diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 75% [95% CI, 56-87]; specificity, 81% [95% CI, 71-88]; OR = 11.65 [95% CI, 4.14-32.78]; P < .001) on multivariate analysis. In contrast, all other contemporaneous demographic, clinical, and imaging features available at CTA were not diagnostic for COVID-19. The presence of apical ground-glass opacification was an independent predictor of increased 30-day mortality (18.0% versus 5.7%, P = .017; hazard ratio = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.42-8.66; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a simple, reliable, and accurate COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic imaging biomarker obtained from CTA lung apices: the presence or absence of ground-glass opacification.

They lead to high morbidity, impose high costs on the health system and are among the major obstacles for pilgrims to perform Hajj duties. The main aim of our study was to determine types, frequencies, etiologies, and epidemiologic factors of respiratory diseases among Iranian Hajj pilgrims and to suggest some preventive and treatment strategies. Methods: To determine the types and frequencies of respiratory syndromes, we implemented a syndromic surveillance method in Iranian health care system for Hajj during 5 consecutive years. To achieve the etiology of these diseases, we performed 4 concurrent before and after studies. We also evaluated efficacy of the flu and pneumovax vaccines among Iranian Hajj pilgrims in 2 studies. To determine some other epidemiological factors, we conducted 4 additional studies. Results: The most common problem was common cold like syndrome. Origins of the most upper respiratory problems were infections, and allergies were less involved. Among infectious agents, viruses were the most common agents and their frequencies were as follows respectively: Adenoviruses 38 (36.2 %), Rhinoviruses 31 (30%), Influenza type B virus 21 (20%). Bacteria were often the secondary causes and their frequencies were as follows respectively: Intestine bacillus 69 (19.4%), Chlamydia pneumonia 20(15.8%), Haemophiluses 32 (9.1%) and Streptococcus (A,C and G) 30 ( 8.5%).

Previous attempts to improve turnaround time through introduction of a turnaround nurse have been hindered by inadequate staffing. We aimed to improve list efficiency and improve turnaround time through the application of marginal gains theory and implementation of a multi-faceted improvement plan. Methods Data was collected from electronic patient records and audit entries made by endoscopy staff. List 'actual' start and stop times were audited against 'scheduled' times. Turnaround time was assessed by a Quality Improvement (QI) Fellow, observing the endoscopy list and collecting information in real time. Results were discussed at a departmental meeting and a 4-stage improvement plan was devised and implemented. Re-audit data was collected to determine effect. Results Preliminary audit data revealed 89% of list starts to be delayed. Lists ran beyond scheduled stop times in 73%. The improvement plan saw: 1) Review and re-organisation of the nursing rota. 2) Departmental commissioning of an external 'change agent' to conduct interviews with nursing and endoscopy managers and work with the QI fellow in designing a bespoke team-building day to address communication strategies and brainstorm perceived departmental issues hindering efficiency. 3) Introduction of an in-room debrief tool, to enhance situation awareness and teamwork. 4) Implementation of a multi-modal 'Nurse-led consent' training programme, combining didactic and in-situ scenariobased simulation training, measuring and recording competence using Directly-Observed-Procedural-Skills (DOPS) assessments. Re-audit data revealed improved list finish-times (49% cf. 27%) although delays in start-times remained. Median turnaround time was 10 minutes, a major improvement from a turnaround time in 20.8 minutes in 2018. Conclusions It is recognised that single improvement interventions are unlikely to result in significant, sustainable change. The aggregation of marginal gains theory dictates that small, marginal gains can add up to a remarkable improvement. Our 4-stage improvement plan saw the implementation of a revised nursing rota and a bespoke team-building day in tandem with the introduction of a 'Nurse Consent' training programme and a novel team debrief tool. In this way, we were able to implement change, whilst simultaneously assessing and addressing staff morale, engage key stakeholders and as a result significantly improve turnaround time.

Due to this lockdown, individuals have been forced to find and use alternatives for accomplishing tasks including shopping, socializing, working, and finding information, and many have turned to the internet and their mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe how South Africans consume and internalize information surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in order to determine whether the COVID-19 lockdown and social isolation have influenced technology behavior, particularly in terms of health communication and information. METHODS: From June 24 to August 24, 2020, people in South Africa were invited to complete a survey through the Upinion mobile app, an online data collection resource. The survey collected information on demographics, and technology use during the lockdown, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: There were 405 participants, of which 296 (73.06%) were female. A total of 320 (79.01%) participants had a tertiary school education, 242 (59.75%) were single, and 173 (42.72%) had full-time employment. The lockdown forced 363 (89.63%) participants to use more technology, especially for work (n=140, 24.05%) and social media/communication (n=133, 22.85%). Security or privacy issues (n=46, 38.98%) and unfamiliarity with technology (n=32, 27.12%) were identified as the most common issues faced by the 127 (31.36%) participants who were unsure about using technology prior to the lockdown. Almost all participants (n=392, 96.79%) stated that they would continue using technology after the lockdown. Multimedia (n=215, 53.09%), mobile phone content (n=99, 24.44%), and health organizations and professionals (n=91, 22.47%) were the main sources of COVID-19 information. Most participants (n=282, 69.63%) felt that they had enough information. Two-thirds (n=275, 67.90%) of participants stated that they had used their mobile phones for health information before the lockdown, with web searches (n=109, 26.91%), social media (n=58, 14.32%), and government and institutional websites (n=52; 12.84%) serving as their main sources of information. Overall, the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 8.8 (out of 10), and 335 (82.72%) had adequate knowledge (scored &#8805;8). Males were less likely to identify the correct transmission routes, and single participants were less likely to identify the signs and symptoms of the coronavirus. Tertiary school graduates were 4 times more likely to correctly identify the routes and 2 times more likely to identify how to stop the spread of the virus. People aged 43-56 years were 4 times more likely to identify how the coronavirus can be prevented, and participants &#8805;57 years were 2.6 times more likely to obtain a knowledge score of 10 when compared to those under 29 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the COVID-19 lockdown has forced people to increase technology use, and people plan to continue using technology after the lockdown is lifted. Increased technology use was seen across a variety of fields; however, barriers including privacy, unfamiliarity, and data costs were identified. This population showed high COVID-19 knowledge, although the use of web searches and social media, instead of government and institutional websites, increases the potential for health misinformation to be spread.","output":"Changes in Perceptions and Use of Mobile Technology and Health Communication in South Africa During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to reveal the perceptions and conspiracy theories surrounding the new coronavirus infection.

METHODS: We performed a comprehensive histomorphologic analysis of autoptic visceral adipose tissue (VAT), lungs and livers of 19 subjects with COVID-19 (COVID-19+), and 23 people without COVID-19 (controls). Human adipocytes (hMADS) infected with SARS-CoV-2 were also studied. RESULTS: Although there were no between-group differences in body-mass-index and adipocytes size, a higher prevalence of CD68+ macrophages among COVID-19+ VAT was detected (p = 0.005) and accompanied by crown-like structures presence, signs of adipocytes stress and death. Consistently, human adipocytes were successfully infected by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and displayed lower cell viability. Being VAT inflammation associated with lipids spill-over from dead adipocytes, we studied lipids distribution by ORO. Lipids were observed within lungs and livers interstitial spaces, macrophages, endothelial cells, and vessels lumen, features suggestive of fat embolism syndrome, more prevalent among COVID-19+ (p < 0.001).

Icosapent ethyl was added to statins in patients with low\\\\density lipoprotein cholesterol <100 mg/dL and fasting triglycerides 135C499 mg/dL. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. There were 8179 patients randomized in REDUCE\\\\IT followed for a median of 4.9 years, and 3408 (41.7%) of them had a prior PCI with a median follow\\\\up of 4.8 years. These patients were randomized a median of 2.9 years (11 days to 30.7 years) after PCI. Among patients treated with icosapent ethyl versus placebo, there was a 34% reduction in the primary composite end point (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58C0.76; P<0.001; number needed to treat(4.8 years)=12) and a 34% reduction in the key secondary composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56C0.79; P<0.001; NNT(4.8 years)=19) versus placebo.

Abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients are important prognostic factors of disease severity. The aim of this study was to analyze coagulation profiles of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 455 Covid-19 patients admitted at Millennium COVID-19 care and treatment center, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from July 1- October 23, 2020. Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and International normalized ratio (INR) were determined on HUMACLOT DUE PLUS? coagulation analyzer (Wiesbaden, Germany). In all statistical analysis of results, p<0.05 was defined as statistically significant. RESULT: A prolonged prothrombin time was found in 46.8% of study participants with COVID-19 and a prolonged prothrombin time and elevated INR in 53.3% of study subjects with severe and 51% of critically COVID patients. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 22.1% of COVID-19 patients. 50.5% and 51.3% of COVID-19 patients older than 55 years had thrombocytopenia and prolonged APTT respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, prolonged prothrombin time and elevated INR were detected in more than 50% of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Thrombocytopenia and prolonged APTT were dominant in COVID-19 patients older than 55 years.

Three types of doubly strapped TADAPs were prepared as nickel(II) complexes using meso-N-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-substituted TADAP and the corresponding aliphatic diacids as precursors. Theoretical calculations revealed that regardless of their oxidation states, all strapped TADAPs had essentially flat &#960;-planes. It was found that the alkyl-chain straps slightly affected the optical and electrochemical properties of the DAP rings, particularly in the oxidized forms. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the antiaromatic character of the 20&#960; TADAPs and the aromatic character of the 18&#960; TADAP dications, and it was observed that they displayed paratropic and diatropic ring-current effects, respectively, on the chemical shifts of methylene protons in the spatially separated alkyl chains. The degree of shielding and deshielding depended on the position of the methylene units; it decreased with increase in separation from the &#960;-plane and central axis of the porphyrin ring. The NMR experiments also revealed that the degree of the diatropic ring currents was clearly related to the &#960;-electron density of the porphyrin ring; the ring-current effects decreased as the charge increased from 0 to +2.

However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm. This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate cancer on MRI.

In particular, pulmonary infections acquired in the community, and pneumonias arising in the hospital setting, represent a major medical and economic problem and thus a continuous challenge to health care. For the radiologist, it is important to understand that community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonia (NP) share a number of characteristics, but should, in many respects be regarded as separate entities. CAP and NP arise in different populations, host different spectra of causative pathogens, and pose different challenges to both the clinician and the radiologist. CAP is generally seen in outpatients, is most frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydia, and its radiologic diagnosis is relatively straightforward. NP, in contrast, develops in the hospital setting, is commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and may generate substantial problems for the radiologist.

The exposed group (N = 101,900) included women who experienced the COVID-19 Level I lockdown (1/23C2/24/2020) during pregnancy, while the unexposed group (N = 493,496) included women who were pregnant during the same calendar months in 2015C2019. Cumulative exposure was calculated based on days exposed to different levels of emergency responses with different weighting. Generalized linear regression models were applied to estimate the associations of lockdown exposure with gestational length and risk of PTB (< 37 weeks). RESULTS: The exposed group had a shorter mean gestational length than the unexposed group (38.66 vs 38.74 weeks: adjusted  = ? 0.06 week [95%CI, ? 0.07, ? 0.05 week]).

Our objective was to describe adherence to cysteamine in NC patients, using electronic monitoring systems. METHODS Patients with confirmed NC, aged > 4 years and receiving oral cysteamine (short acting or delayed release formulation as standard of care) from 3 French reference centers, were included. Adherence to treatment was primarily assessed as the percentage of days with a good adherence score, adherence score rating from 0 (poor) to 2 (good). A descriptive analysis was performed after 1-year follow-up. RESULTS Seventeen patients (10 girls, median age: 13.9 (5.4-33.0) years) were included. Median age at diagnosis was 17.0 (3.0-76.9) months and age at start of cysteamine was 21.0 (15.5-116.3) months. Median daily dose of cysteamine was 1.05 (0.55-1.63) g/m2/day. Over the year, the median percentage of days with a good adherence score was 80 (1-99)% decreasing to 68 (1-99)% in patients > 11 years old. The median of average number of hours covered by treatment in a day was 22.5 (6.1-23.9) versus 14.9 (9.2-20.5) hours for delayed release versus short acting cysteamine. CONCLUSION Our data are the first describing a rather good adherence to cysteamine, decreasing in adolescents and adults. We described a potential interest of the delayed release formulation.

The screening was initiated by evaluating the 40 compounds from Carica papaya leaves for their drug-like likeness property. The selected compounds were then secondly screened using carcinogenic and toxicity filters. Further selected compounds were thirdly screened for their pharmacokinetic profile and the screening was lastly performed by docking the third selected compounds against multiple protein targets of SARS-Coronavirus-2 employing 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), endonuclease (EndoU), S1 and S2 region of spike protein. The results show that 20 of 40 compounds, which meet the requirements of drug-like likeness, carcinogenicity-toxicity filter, and pharmacokinetic profiles, can interact with the multiple protein targets of SARS-Coronavirus-2 with the order from high to low affinity as follows: S1 > 3CLpro > EndoU > RdRp > PLpro > S2.

COVID-19 has been reported to be rarely associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) severe deficiency, the hallmark of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), induces the formation of platelet, unusually large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer microthrombi. In immune-mediated TTP, ADAMTS13 adopts specifically an open conformation. The VWF/ADAMTS13 couple may contribute to the microthrombi formation in pulmonary alveolar capillaries in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical features, hemostatic laboratory parameters, VWF/ADAMTS13 axis, and ADAMTS13 conformation in critically ill COVID-19 patients at admission. METHODS: Fifty three critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled between March 18 and May 9 2020 in a monocentric hospital. RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and the male-to-female ratio was 2.8/1. We reported seven pulmonary embolisms and 15 deaths. Biological investigations showed increased fibrinogen and factor V levels, and strongly increased D-dimers correlated with mortality. No patient presented severe thrombocytopenia nor microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. An imbalance between high VWF antigen levels and normal or slightly decreased ADAMTS13 activity levels (strongly elevated VWF/ADAMTS13 ratio) was correlated with mortality. Three patients had a partial quantitative deficiency in ADAMTS13. We also reported a closed conformation of ADAMTS13 in all patients, reinforcing the specificity of an open conformation of ADAMTS13 as a hallmark of TTP. CONCLUSION: We suggest that slightly decreased or normal ADAMTS13 activity and highly elevated VWF are rather biomarkers reflecting both the strong inflammation and the endothelial damage rather than drivers of the thrombotic process of COVID-19.","output":"Imbalance of von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS13 axis is rather a biomarker of strong inflammation and endothelial damage than a cause of thrombotic process in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at a critical period in the control of the epidemic.

As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control.

Two short open reading frames (sORFs) initiated by AUGs 2 and 3 are also present. To understand translational regulation in this system, we systematically mutated AUGs 1C4 and monitored polypeptide synthesis from plasmids and recombinant viruses. This identified sORF2 as a key regulatory element with opposing effects on PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 expression. We propose a model in which AUGs 1C4 are accessed by leaky ribosomal scanning, with sORF2 repressing synthesis of downstream PB1-F2. However, sORF2 also up-regulates PB1-N40 expression, most likely by a reinitiation mechanism that permits skipping of AUG4. Surprisingly, we also found that in contrast to plasmid-driven expression, viruses with improved AUG1 initiation contexts produced less PB1 in infected cells and replicated poorly, producing virions with elevated particle:PFU ratios. Analysis of the genome content of virus particles showed reduced packaging of the mutant segment 2 vRNAs. Overall, we conclude that segment 2 mRNA translation is regulated by a combination of leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation, and that the sequences surrounding the PB1 AUG codon are multifunctional, containing overlapping signals for translation initiation and for segment-specific packaging.","output":"Overlapping signals for translational regulation and packaging of influenza A virus segment 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that clinical manifestations of childrens COVID-19 may be less severe. However, it has been described the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) which resembles other inflammatory conditions (i.e. Kawasaki disease). Patients affected by PIMS-TS showed cardiac involvement with myocardial injury, reduced left ventricle systolic function and coronary artery abnormalities. Little is known regarding cardiac involvement in pediatric patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 23 pediatric patients (13males, 56%) with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on PCR analysis of nasopharingeal swab (NPS), and asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic for COVID-19. Patients underwent standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within 2-3 month from diagnosis and after negative NPS for SARS-CoV-2. We performed offline analysis with GE EchoPAC software to measure global longitudinal strain (GLS) of the LV using 2D speckle tracking imaging. Therefore, we compared the results with a matched group of 23 controls (13males, 56%). RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar regarding age (5.9  4.1years vs. 6.4  4.4 years, p = 0.63), body surface area (0.98  0.3m2 vs. 0.8  0.4m2, p = 0.17), LV FS (37.9  5.9% vs. 36.4  8.3%, p = 0.74) and LV biplane EF (63.9  5.2% vs. 66.4  5.3%, p = 0.11). GLS analysis showed significant strain reduction of the LV mid-wall segments and of the basal anterior, posterior and septal inferior segments among cases compared to controls. Furthermore, in the case group there were 7 subjects (30%) with a strain below 16.5% in at least 3 segments. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect LV deformation in asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic children, showing a peculiar pattern with lower longitudinal strain in all mid-wall segments of LV compared to control subjects.

Diagnostics which detect active asymptomatic infection, which are suitable for monitoring and surveillance, may be of benefit to the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination campaign on the ISC. Methodology/Principal Findings: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the direct agglutination test (DAT), and the Leishmania antigen ELISA were carried out on blood and urine samples collected from 720 household and neighbouring contacts of 276 VL and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) index cases, with no symptoms or history of VL and PKDL, in endemic regions of Bangladesh between September 2016 and March 2018. Of the 720 contacts of index cases, asymptomatic infection was detected in 69 (9.6%) participants by a combination of qPCR (1.0%), LAMP (2.1%), DAT (3.9%), and Leishmania antigen ELISA (3.3%). Only 1 (0.1%) participant was detected positive by all 4 diagnostic tests. Poor agreement between tests was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistics, however the Leishmania antigen ELISA and DAT in combination capture all participants positive by more than one test.

Despite efforts including improved biosecurity and vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. Based on phylogenetic analysis of open reading frame 5 (ORF5), Korean PRRSVs are known to form not only globally circulating lineages but also country-specific lineages (Lin Kor A, B, and C). To understand the recent epidemiological status of PRRSV in Korea, a total of 1349 ORF5 sequences of Korean PRRSV isolates from 2014 to 2019 were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the maximum-likelihood method, and temporal changes in the relative prevalence of lineages were investigated. The analysis showed that PRRSV1 and PRRSV2 were both highly prevalent throughout the years examined. Among the PRRSV1 isolates, subgroup A (90.1%) and vaccine-like subgroup C (9.0%) composed most of the population. For PRRSV2 isolates, vaccine-like lineage 5 (36.3%) was dominant, followed by Lin Kor B (25.9%), Kor C (16.6%), lineage 1 (11.6%), and Kor A (9.1%). The PRRSV2 lineage 1 population increased from 2014 (1.8%) to 2019 (29.6%) in Korea due to the continual spread of sublineage 1.8 (NADC30-like) and introduction of sublineage 1.6 into the country. Additional genetic analysis, including analysis of non synonymous and synonymous mutations, revealed evidence of diversification and positive selection in immunologically important regions of the genome, suggesting that current vaccination is failing and promoting immune-mediated selection. Overall, these findings provide insights into the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of cocirculating viral lineages, and constant surveillance of PRRSV occurrence is needed.","output":"Temporal lineage dynamics of the ORF5 gene of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Korea in 2014-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aim was to explore the effects of multisensory breastmilk interventions on short-term pain of infants during newborn screening.

Understanding differences in tolerance of uncertainty is an important research area. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors associated with tolerance of uncertainty, including well-being metrics such as burnout. DESIGN: Online confidential survey. SETTING: The Massachusetts General Physicians Organization (MGPO). PARTICIPANTS: All 2172 clinically active faculty in the MGPO. MAIN MEASURES: We examined associations for tolerance of uncertainty with demographic information, personal and professional characteristics, and physician well-being metrics. KEY RESULTS: Two thousand twenty (93%) physicians responded. Multivariable analyses identified significant associations of lower tolerance of uncertainty with female gender (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03C1.48); primary care practice (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.22C2.00); years since training (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98C0.995); and lacking a trusted advisor (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03C1.53). Adjusting for demographic and professional characteristics, physicians with low tolerance of uncertainty had higher likelihood of being burned-out (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.41C3.88), were less likely to be satisfied with career (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.26C0.52), and less likely to be engaged at work (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84C0.90). CONCLUSION: At a time when concern about physician well-being is high, with much speculation about causes of burnout, we found a strong relationship between tolerance of uncertainty and physician well-being, across specialties. Particular attention likely needs to be paid to those with less experience, those in specialties with high rates of undifferentiated illness and uncertainty, such as primary care, and ensuring all physicians have access to a trusted advisor.

Although results indicate possible language impairment, only one study used domain-specific language tasks. Two out of four studies on visuospatial function did not report any impairment. Conclusion: Patients with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to experience global cognitive impairment, impairment in memory, attention and executive function, and in particular verbal fluency. Based on the current results, we recommend clinicians to evaluate the need for cognitive assessment of patients with a recent COVID-19 infection, regardless of the severity of the disease, treatment methods and length of ICU stay.

Early start of transfusion has shown improved survival. Thus, a balanced blood inventory must be available in all levels of health care to ensure early stabilization and damage control resuscitation of patients with bleeding. Whole blood has been reintroduced as a blood product for massive bleeding situations because it affords plasma, red blood cells, and platelets in a balanced ratio in a logistically advantageous way. In this article, we describe how to establish a whole blood-based blood preparedness program in a small rural hospital with limited resources. We present an implementation tool kit, which includes discussions on whole blood program strategies and the process of developing detailed procedures on donor selection, collection, storage, and transfusion management of whole blood. The importance of training and audit of the routines is highlighted, and establishment of an emergency walking blood bank is discussed. We conclude that implementation of a whole blood program is achievable in small rural hospitals and recommend that rural health care facilities at all treatment levels enable early balanced transfusion for patients with life-threatening bleeding by establishing protocols for whole blood-based preparedness.","output":"How do I implement a whole blood-based blood preparedness program in a small rural hospital?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess respiratory system impedance (Z(rs)) and spirometric parameters in children and adolescents with and without a history of preterm birth. METHODS: We evaluated a sample of 51 subjects between 11 and 14 years of age: 35 who had a history of preterm birth (preterm group) and 16 who had been born at term (full-term group). Lung function was measured by spirometry, spectral oscillometry, and intra-breath oscillometry. RESULTS: Neither spirometry nor spectral oscillometry revealed any statistically significant differences between the preterm and full-term groups. However, intra-breath oscillometry demonstrated significant differences between the two groups in terms of the change in resistance, reactance at end-inspiration, and the change in reactance (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that abnormalities in Z(rs) persist in children and adolescents with a history of preterm birth and that intra-breath oscillometry is more sensitive than is spectral oscillometry.

One alternative to reducing COVID-19 patients is to use existing drugs until a vaccine is found and ready for use. Currently, hydroxychloroquine has been widely researched as a candidate for anti-COVID-19 medicines, which has now entered the clinical trial stage. However, the solubility of hydroxychloroquine in water is so small that it impacts its low bioavailability in the human body. One way to increase hydroxychloroquine's solubility in water is through the formation of a stable inclusion complex with hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin. In this research, a molecular docking study and semiempirical quantum method were conducted to investigate the interaction between hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin and hydroxychloroquine. The molecular docking study results and semiempirical quantum method show that hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin and hydroxychloroquine form stable inclusion complex.

This study aims to describe the pooled experience of LT for patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS in Korea. METHODS: A nationwide multicenter retrospective observational study was performed with consecutive LT for severe COVID-19-related ARDS in South Korea (June 2020CJune 2021). Data were collected and compared with other LTs after bridging with ECMO from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry. RESULTS: Eleven patients with COVID-19-related ARDS underwent LT. The median age was 60.0 years [interquartile range (IQR), 57.5C62.5; six males]. All patients were supported with venovenous ECMO at LT listing and received rehabilitation before LT. Patients were transplanted at a median of 49 (IQR, 32C66) days after ECMO cannulation. Primary graft dysfunction within 72 h of LT developed in two (18.2%). One patient expired 4 days after LT due to sepsis and one patient underwent retransplantation for graft failure.

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19. Methods This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days post-diagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes. Results Of 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p<0.05). 57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p<0.05). Therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use was associated with increased thromboembolism risk (Odds ratio = 14.327, 95% CI 1.904 - 107.811, p = 0.010). Conclusions Antiplatelet choice was shown to have no impact on survival or thromboembolism development in COVID-19. Anticoagulant choice did not impact survival or thromboembolism development, aside from LMWH. Therapeutic LMWH use was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. However, it should be noted that the sample size for patients using therapeutic LMWH was small (n=4), and there may be confounding variables affecting both LMWH use and thromboembolism development. These findings should be repeated with a larger sample of patients using therapeutic LMWH with additional adjustment for cofounding variables.","output":"Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets in COVID-19: Impact on Survival and Thromboembolism Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy, both with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), on prognosis of COVID-19 older patients. METHODS: Single-center prospective study conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) of a teaching hospital, referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We evaluated all the patients  65 years, consecutively admitted to our ED for confirmed COVID-19. We compared the clinical outcome of those who were on chronic OAC at ED admission with those who did not, using a propensity score matched paired cohort of controls. The primary study endpoint was all-cause in-hospital death. Patients were matched for age, sex, clinical comorbidities, and clinical severity at presentation (based on NEWS  6). Study parameters were assessed for association to all-cause in-hospital death by a multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify independent risk factor for survival. RESULTS: Although overall mortality was slightly higher for anticoagulated patients compared to controls (63.3% vs 43.5%, p = 0.012), the multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not significant (HR = 1.56 [0.78C3.12]; p = 0.208). Both DOACs (HR 1.46 [0.73C2.92]; p = 0.283) and VKAs (HR 1.14 [0.48C2.73]; p = 0.761) alone did not affect overall survival in our cohort.

Eight weeks before the first COVID-19 pandemic closure, the patient, an 8-year-old female neutered cross breed dog weighing 6 kg, was presented for nonstop barking when separated from her owners, 8 hours a day, 5 days each week. Before the first consultation, 4 years of training based on desensitization without medication helped the patient but never lowered the barking beyond two hours a day, which remains way too high to provide a correct quality of life to this dog. The patient welfare was at stake, and the neighborhood complains were growing. The patient was prescribed fluoxetine at 20 mg (3.3 mg/kg) PO q24 h. and trazodone PRN before separation at 25 mg (4.2 mg/kg) PO. A behavioral modification plan based on extinction and calm reinforcement was prescribed. Eight weeks after the treatment onset, just before the first COVID-19 pandemic closure, the dog improved significantly, lowered daily barking up to 15 minutes. During all the successive closures (i.e., one year), the dog was never left alone. When the closures ended, the barking relapsed, straight at the first separation event, reaching 1 to 2 hours daily, even though the fluoxetine had never been interrupted. Therefore, gabapentin was prescribed PRN before separation at 100 mg (16.6 mg/kg) in place of trazodone that triggered excitation in the patient when it was previously tried. The behavioral plan was completed with additional conditioning learning before sep-aration. The dog improved quickly to a short tolerable time of barking (i.e., 5 to 10 minutes). This outcome remains stable by the time the paper is written i.e., 3 months after the end of the closure. The patients evolution emphasizes two important topics in the treatment of separation-related disorder: firstly, medication is needed for most cases to lower the level of emotional reaction, and secondly, interruption in the exposition to the fearful context may have rebound effects when the context will be encountered again. The long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown on both human and dogs welfare.

The pandemic's impact on people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that the UK-wide lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe COPD exacerbations. We provide the first national level analyses of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on severe COPD exacerbations resulting in emergency hospital admissions and/or leading to death as well as those recorded in primary care or emergency departments. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we accessed weekly counts of emergency hospital admissions and deaths due to COPD over the first 30 weeks of 2020 and compared these to the national averages over the preceding 5 years. For both Scotland and Wales, we undertook interrupted time-series analyses to model the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with 48% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for COPD in both countries (incidence rate ratio, IRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.58), relative to the 5-year averages. There was no statistically significant change in deaths due to COPD (pooled IRR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33). In Wales, lockdown was associated with 39% reduction in primary care consultations for acute exacerbation of COPD (IRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) and 46% reduction in COPD-related emergency department attendances (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The UK-wide lockdown was associated with the most substantial reductions in COPD exacerbations ever seen across Scotland and Wales, with no corresponding increase in COPD deaths. This may have resulted from reduced transmission of respiratory infections, reduced exposure to outdoor air pollution and/or improved COPD self-management.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the incidence and mortality of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: national interrupted time series analyses for Scotland and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Singapore was one of the earliest countries affected by COVID-19, outside China.

They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported. RESULTS: In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis. DISCUSSION: With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis.

Utilizing data from mobile devices and county-level demographic data, we evaluated the impact of policy changes on population mobility and explored whether demographic characteristics explained variability in responsiveness to policy changes. For each Californian county, we calculated the proportion of people staying home and the average number of daily trips taken per 100 persons, across different trip distances and compared this to pre-COVID-19 levels. We found that overall mobility decreased when counties moved to a more restrictive tier and increased when moving to a less restrictive tier, as the policy intended. When placed in a more restrictive tier, the greatest decrease in mobility was observed for shorter and medium-range trips, while there was an unexpected increase in the longer trips. The mobility response varied by geographic region, as well as county-level median income, gross domestic product, the prevalence of farms, and recent election results.

An aliquot of stock virus (5.6  10(5) TCID50/mL) and each serial PEDV dilution were mixed into 4.5-kg batches of feed to create 9 PEDV-inoculated feed doses; 1 virus-negative dose of culture medium in feed was also created. Pigs were challenge exposed via oral administration of PEDV-inoculated feed, and fecal swab specimens were collected. All pigs were euthanized 7 days after challenge exposure; fresh tissues were collected and used for PCR assay, histologic examination, and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS The PCR cycle threshold (Ct) decreased by approximately 10 when PEDV was added to feed, compared with results for equivalent PEDV diluted in tissue culture medium. Pigs became infected with PEDV when challenge exposed with the 4 highest concentrations (lowest concentration to cause infection, 5.6  10(1) TCID50/g; Ct = 27 in tissue culture medium and 37 in feed). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In this study, PEDV in feed with detectable Ct values of 27 to 37 was infective. The Ct was 37 for the lowest infective PEDV dose in feed, which may be above the limit of detection established for PEDV PCR assays used by some diagnostic laboratories. Overall, results indicated 5.6  10(1) TCID50/g was the minimum PEDV dose in feed that can lead to infection in 10-day-old pigs under the conditions of this study.","output":"Evaluation of the minimum infectious dose of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in virus-inoculated feed."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) interesting for automated image segmentation, analysis and classification, among others and has already been described for various fields of ophthalmology.

IBD is a common and troublesome disease that still lacks effective therapy and imaging options. As an attempt to improve the disease treatment, we tested &#945;MSH for the targeting of nanoliposomes to IBD sites. &#945;MSH, an endogenous tridecapeptide, binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. MC1-R is found on macrophages, neutrophils and the renal tubule system. We formulated and tested a liposomal nanoparticle involving &#945;MSH in order to achieve a specific targeting to the inflamed intestines. METHODS: NDP-&#945;MSH peptide conjugated to Alexa Fluor&#8482; 680 was linked to the liposomal membrane via NSuccinyl PE and additionally loaded into the lumen of the liposomes. Liposomes without the &#945;MSH-conjugate and free NDP-&#945;MSH were used as a control. The liposomes were also loaded with ICG to track them. The liposomes were tested in DSS treated mice, which had received DSS via drinking water order to develop a model IBD. Inflammation severity was assessed by the Disease Activity Index (DAI) score and ex vivo histological CD68 staining of samples taken from different parts of the intestine. The liposome targeting was analyzed by analyzing the ICG and ALEXA 680 fluorescence in the intestine compared to the biodistribution. RESULTS: NPD-&#945;MSH was successfully labeled with Alexa and retained its biological activity. Liposomes were identified in expected regions in the inflamed bowel regions and in the kidneys, where MC1-R is abundant. In vivo liposome targeting correlated with the macrophage concentration at the site of the inflammation supporting the active targeting of the liposomes through &#945;MSH. The liposomal &#945;MSH was well tolerated by animals. CONCLUSION: This study opens up the possibility to further develop an &#945;MSH targeted theranostic delivery to different clinically relevant applications in IBD inflammation but also opens possibilities for use in other inflammations like lung inflammation in Covid 19.","output":"Alpha-MSH Targeted Liposomal Nanoparticle for Imaging in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play significant roles in various cancer types However, the functions of RBPs have not been clarified in renal papillary cell carcinoma (pRCC) In this study, we identified 31 downregulated and 89 upregulated differentially expressed RBPs on the basis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and performed functional enrichment analyses Subsequently, through univariate Cox, random survival forest, and multivariate Cox regression analysis, six RBPs of SNRPN, RRS1, INTS8, RBPMS2, IGF2BP3, and PIH1D2 were screened out, and the prognostic model was then established Further analyses revealed that the high-risk group had poor overall survival The area under the curve values were 0 87 and 0 75 at 3 years and 0 78 and 0 69 at 5 years in the training set and test set, respectively We then plotted a nomogram on the basis of the six RBPs and tumor stage with the substantiation in the TCGA cohort Moreover, we selected two intersectant RBPs and evaluate their biological effects by GSEA and predicted three drugs, including STOCK1N-28457, pyrimethamine, and trapidil by using the Connectivity Map Our research provided a novel insight into pRCC and improved the determination of prognosis and individualized therapeutic strategies","output":"Integrated Analysis of the Prognosis-Associated RNA-Binding Protein Genes and Candidate Drugs in Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Political and managerial reforms affect the health sector by translating into governance tensions.

METHODS: We conduct a contrasting case study exploring the cases of two French healthcare organisations, one private for-profit (clinic) and one public not-for-profit (cancer treatment centre). Our analyses are mainly based on the content analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews conducted with staff (nurses, doctors, management and administrative staff) of these two organisations. RESULTS: Our results show that these tensions can be distinguished into three categories (tensions on professional values, standards and practices) which are expressed differently depending on the type of healthcare organisation and its main management characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, in the for-profit organisation, the most intense tensions concern professional standards, whereas they concern professional practices in the not-for-profit organisation.

MOCs often use a technology called pressure swing adsorption (PSA), which relies on nitrogen-selective adsorbents for producing oxygen from ambient air. MOCs are often designed for fixed product specifications, thereby limiting their use in meeting varying product specifications caused by a change in patients medical condition or activity. To address this limitation, we design and optimize flexible single-bed MOC systems that are capable of meeting varying product specification requirements. Specifically, we employ a simulation-based optimization framework for optimizing flexible PSA- and pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA)-based MOC systems. Detailed optimization studies are performed to benchmark the performance limits of LiX, LiLSX and 5A zeolite adsorbents. The results indicate that LiLSX outperforms both LiX and 5A, and can produce 90% pure oxygen at 21.7 L/min. Moreover, the LiLSX-based flexible PVSA system can manufacture varying levels of oxygen purity and flow rate in the range 93C95.7% and 1C15 L/min, respectively.

Therefore, we simulated fiberoptic endotracheal intubation on a mannequin representing the patient, using an ultrathin flexible gastrointestinal endoscope as an alternative to the bronchoscope, in order to maintain distance from the patient during the procedure. We performed this procedure 10 times and measured the time required; the median procedure time was 6.4 s (interquartile range, 5.7-8.1 s). The advantage of this method is the short procedure time and distance maintained from the patients. The flexible tip-steerable control and length of the gastrointestinal endoscope contributed to shortening the procedure time and maintaining distance from the patients. In addition, this method can handle difficult airways without risk of misplacement of the endotracheal tube.

Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits. Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS. Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness.

Here, based on known physical properties of such 3-D instabilities, we propose a simple, energy-conserving model describing this situation. It consists of a 2D point-vortex flow coupled to localized 3D perturbations (ergophages), such that ergophages can gain energy by altering vortex-vortex distances through an induced divergent velocity field, thus decreasing point-vortex energy. We investigate the model in three distinct stages of evolution: (i) The linear regime, where the ergophage amplitude grows or decays exponentially on average, with a randomly fluctuating instantaneous growth rate. The growth rate has a small auto-correlation time, and follows a probability distribution featuring a power-law tail with exponent between -2 and -5/3 (up to a cut-off), depending on the point-vortex base flow. Consequently, the logarithmic ergophage amplitude performs a free L\\\\'evy flight. (ii) The passive-nonlinear regime of the model, where the 2D flow evolves independently of the ergophage amplitudes, which saturate by non-linear self-interactions without affecting the 2D flow. In this regime the system exhibits a new type of on-off intermittency that we name L\\\\'evy on-off intermittency, and which we study in a companion paper. We compute the bifurcation diagram for the mean and variance of the perturbation amplitude, as well as the probability density of the perturbation amplitude. (iii) Finally, we characterize the the fully nonlinear regime, where ergophages feed back on the 2D flow, and study how the vortex temperature is altered by the interaction with ergophages.

METHODS: We conducted an epidemiologic outbreak investigation, including case finding and contact tracing and screening. MERS-CoV cases were categorized as suspected, probable, and confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Of the 130 suspected cases, 81 (62%) were confirmed and 49 (38%) were probable. These included 87 patients (67%) and 43 healthcare workers (33%). Older age (mean [SD], 64.4 [18.3] vs 40.1 [11.3] years, P<.001), symptoms (97% vs 58%, P<.001), and comorbidity (99% vs 42%, P<.001) were more common in patients than healthcare workers. Almost all patients (97%) were hospitalized whereas most healthcare workers (72%) were home isolated.

Preliminary evidence suggests that preterm births dropped dramatically following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We undertook a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on 9, 15, and 23 March 2020 on the incidence of preterm birth. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-2020) and cross-validated these against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were conducted according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socio-economic status. Results Data on 1,599,549 singleton newborns were available, including 56,720 post-implementation births. Consistent reductions in preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding implementation of the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures: +/- 2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.91), p=0.002; +/- 3 months (n=796,531): 0.85 (0.73-0.98), p=0.028; +/- 4 months (n=1,066,872): 0.84 (0.73-0.97), p=0.023. Decreases observed following the 15 March measures were of smaller magnitude and not statistically significant. No changes were observed after 23 March. Preterm birth reductions after 9 March were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to high-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods, but effect modification was not statistically significant. Conclusion In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a 15-23% drop in preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations in other countries. It is now of pivotal importance that integration of comparable data from across the globe is undertaken to further substantiate these findings and start exploring the underlying mechanisms.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the incidence of preterm birth: a national quasi-experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The KI and WU polyomaviruses were found in 11 (2.7%) and 17 (4.2%) of 406 nasopharyngeal aspirates, respectively, from children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI).

The aim of this study is to review the available literature concerning safety and efficacy of vaccines in MG. In addition, we also conducted a retrospective research of MG exacerbations and new onset MG after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a large cohort of patients. METHODS: A study of the available literature regarding vaccines and MG was carried out through research in the online database Pubmed. We also retrospectively collected data from 80 MG patients, who were followed at the Treviso Hospital and completed an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination cycle. For each patient, we recorded MG exacerbations between first and second doses and within a window period of 1 day C 6 weeks after the second dose. RESULTS: We found 26 relevant articles about influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other vaccines. No clear associations between most vaccines and MG exacerbations were found. Moreover, cases of new onset post-vaccine MG are mostly anecdotal, except for Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine. Concerning our cohort, 4/80 (5%) MG patients experienced an exacerbation within the post-vaccine window period. In addition, we report a case of new onset post-vaccine MG. DISCUSSION: Inactivated and subunit vaccines are safe and effective in MG. Although some of them, such as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, might uncommonly cause MG exacerbations, data from our review suggest that benefits still outweigh by far the potential risks, thus they should be recommended to these patients. Nevertheless, large prospective studies are needed for further investigations.","output":"Vaccines and myasthenia gravis: a comprehensive review and retrospective study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a large cohort of myasthenic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on clinical presentation, pathophysiology, high infectivity, high cardiovascular involvement, and therapeutic agents with cardiovascular toxicity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), regular cardiovascular treatment is being changing greatly.

Fibrinolytic therapy can be considered a reasonable option for the relatively stable ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patient with suspected or known COVID-19. However, primary percutaneous coronary intervention is still the standard of care in patients with definite STEMI if personal protective equipment is available and cardiac catheterization laboratory has a good infection control. In patients with elevated cardiac enzymes, it is very important to differentiate patients with Type 2 myocardial infarction or myocarditis from those with true acute coronary syndromes because invasive percutaneous intervention management in the former may be unnecessary, especially if they are hemodynamically stable.

However, the current developed vaccines or drugs may be not effective in preventing the pandemic of COVID-19 due to the mutations of coronavirus and the severe side effects of the newly developed vaccines. Chinese herbal medicines and their active components play important antiviral activities. Corilagin exhibited antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, whether it blocks the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 has not been elucidated. PURPOSE: To characterize an active compound, corilagin derived from Phyllanthus urinaria as potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors for its possible preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products. METHODS: Computational docking coupled with bio-layer interferometry, BLI were adopted to screen more than 1800 natural compounds for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD inhibitors. Corilagin was confirmed to have a strong binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2-RBD or human ACE2 (hACE2) protein by the BLI, ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of viral infection of corilagin was assessed by in vitro pseudovirus system. Finally, the toxicity of corilagin was examined by using MTT assay and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) studies in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Corilagin preferentially binds to a pocket that contains residues Cys 336 to Phe 374 of spike-RBD with a relatively low binding energy of -9.4 kcal/mol. BLI assay further confirmed that corilagin exhibits a relatively strong binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 protein. In addition, corilagin dose-dependently blocks SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding and abolishes the infectious property of RBD-pseudotyped lentivirus in hACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, which mimicked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus in human host cells. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that up to 300 mg/kg/day of corilagin was safe in C57BL/6 mice. Our findings suggest that corilagin could be a safe and potential antiviral agent against the COVID-19 acting through the blockade of the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD to hACE2 receptors.

Private car driving has for a long time been the main mode of transport for retail and service trips, and grocery shopping trips represent over 60% of the retail and service travels. Despite the growing number of studies addressing accessibility to daily destinations, to the best of the authors knowledge there are no studies examining these issues over time. METHODS: This paper aims to investigate changes in accessibility to grocery stores over time and use two counties in Norway as examples. Based on GIS data at a detailed level, distances from dwellings to nearest grocery store has been examined. FINDINGS: The results from the spatial analyses reveal significant changes from 1980 to 2019: The share of the population living within 500-m from a grocery store has decreased from 55% to 34% in one of the counties examined and from 36% to 19% in the other. This indicates that the share of people living within walking distance to a local grocery store has nearly halved. With such changes in accessibility to grocery stores, increased car driving for grocery shopping should not come as a surprise.

In the present opinion paper, we discuss the role of hyperaldosteronism in the increasing risk of cardiac complications in COVID-19 older patients. In particular, we focus on the immunoregulatory activity of aldosterone, as the last mediator of the Renin Angiotensin System cascade, in activating the innate and adaptive immune response related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly. Aldosterone may stimulate dendritic cells and the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages in the endothelium of coronary vessels, favoring the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and T-cells response.

This was performed to mimic the probable cumulative epidemic trajectories and predict future daily incidence by fitting the data to existing daily incidence and the estimated R(0) by a model based on the assumption that daily incidence follows Poisson distribution. The maximum-likelihood (ML) value of R(0) was 2.242 for COVID-19 outbreak, as on June 2020. The median with 95% CI of R(0) values was 2.242 (1.50C3.00) estimated by bootstrap resampling method.

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC(50)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (C(max ): EC(50 )roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. METHODS: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5C14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1C4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. RESULTS: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. CONCLUSION: Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated.

This condition is caused by damage to the small nerve fibers and its assessment is challenging, due to the lack of simple and objective diagnostic techniques. The present study aimed to develop a contactless photoplethysmography system using simple instrumentation, for objective and non-invasive assessment of small cutaneous sensory nerve fiber function. The approach is based on the use of contactless photoplethysmography for the characterization of skin flowmotions and topical heating evoked vasomotor responses. The feasibility of the technique was evaluated on volunteers (n = 14) using skin topical anesthesia, which is able to produce temporary alterations of cutaneous nerve fibers function. In the treated skin region in comparison to intact skin: neurogenic and endothelial component of flowmotions decreased by ~61% and 41%, the local heating evoked flare area decreased by ~44%, vasomotor response trend peak and nadir were substantially reduced. The results indicate for the potential of the remote photoplethysmography in the assessment of the cutaneous nerve fiber function. It is believed that in the future this technique could be used in the clinics as an affordable alternative to laser Doppler imaging technique.","output":"Remote Photoplethysmography for Evaluation of Cutaneous Sensory Nerve Fiber Function ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a heavy impact on the world economy, which arouses growing concerns about potential systemic risk, taking place in countries and regions. At this critical moment, it makes sense to interpret the systemic risk from the perspective of the financial crisis framework. By combing the latest research on systemic risks, we may arrive at some precautions relating to the current events. This literature review verifies the origin of systemic risk research. By comparing the retrieved and screened systemic literature with the relevant research on the financial crisis, more focus on the micro-foundations of systemic risk has been discovered. Besides, the measurement methods of systemic risks and the introduction of interdisciplinary methods have made the research in this field particularly active. This paper synthesizes the previous research conclusions to find the appropriate definition of systemic risk and combs the research literature of systemic risk from two lines: Firstly, conducting the division according to the sub-branch fields within the financial discipline and the relevant interdisciplinary research methods, which is helpful for scholars within and outside the discipline to have a more systematic understanding of the research in this field.

During the pandemic, whole genome sequencing has played an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Although an unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes have been submitted in GISAID and NCBI, data from Pakistan is scarce. We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan. The oropharyngeal swabs of patients that were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR at National Institute of Health, Pakistan, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc., MA, US) and Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US). Based on whole-genome analysis, three Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered into the 20A (GH) clade along with the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The two 19B (S)-clade strains were closely related to viruses from India and Oman. Overall, twenty-nine amino acid mutations were detected in the current study genome sequences, including fifteen missense and four novel mutations. Notably, we have found a D614G (aspartic acid to glycine) mutation in spike protein of the sequences from the GH clade. The G614 variant carrying the characteristic D614G mutation has been shown to be more infectious that lead to its rapid spread worldwide. This report highlights the detection of GH and S clade strains and G614 variant from Pakistan warranting large-scale whole-genome sequencing of strains prevalent in different regions to understand virus evolution and to explore their genetic diversity.","output":"Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 reveals the detection of G614 variant in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disproportionately affects African Americans, and they tend to experience more severe course and adverse outcomes. Using a simple and validated instrument of depression screening, we evaluated the incidence and severity of major depression among African American patients within 90 days of recovery from severe COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS: African American patients hospitalized and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were screened for depression within 90 days of hospital discharge using the validated patient health questionnaires (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age was 52.5 years [IQR 44-65] and 65% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (66%) and diabetes mellitus (51%). Forty-four percent of the patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on their PHQ-9 questionnaire responses. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), in patients > 75 years (66%) and those with multiple comorbidities (45%). Eighteen percent of the patients had moderate depression, while 15% and 22% had moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Only 26% (n=7/27) of eligible patients were receiving treatment for depression at the time of this survey.

Given the paucity of research exploring how undocumented migrants are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we set out to explore the association between being an undocumented migrant and a range of social and mental health measures. MethodsOur study draws on three complementary surveys conducted among migrants in France between April 1st and June 7th 2020 (APART TOGETHER, MAKASI, ECHO; n = 716). We tested associations between eight outcome measures, covering health literacy, prevention behaviours, perceptions of government responses, livelihoods and mental health (PHQ-9 score), and the participants legal status as either undocumented or documented. We modelled the probability of food insecurity increase, job loss, depression, and responses to SARS-COV-2 symptoms with logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender and legal status. ResultsUndocumented migrants had a higher probability of experiencing food insecurity increase (aORs=10.40 [3.59, 30.16], and 2.19 [1.39, 3.50] in APART TOGETHER and ECHO), a higher probability of depression (aOR=2.65 [1.01, 6.97] in MAKASI). In all three surveys, undocumented migrants were more likely to lose their job (aORs=6.51 [1.18, 36.00], 8.36 [1.08, 64.70] and 3.96 [1.79, 9.16] in APART TOGETHER, MAKASI and ECHO respectively).

To assess the economic impact of not meeting the target until 2045, we estimated full-income losses in 120 countries, including those due to excess deaths resulting from COVID-19-related disruptions to tuberculosis services, for the period 2020C50. METHODS: Annual mortality risk changes at each age in each year from 2020 to 2050 were estimated for 120 countries. This risk change was then converted to full-income risk by calculating a population-level mortality risk change and multiplying it by the value of a statistical life-year in each country and year. As a comparator, we assumed that current rates of tuberculosis continue to decline through the period of analysis. We calculated the full-income losses, and mean life expectancy losses per person, at birth and at age 35 years, under scenarios in which the SDG targets are met in 2030 and in 2045. We defined the cost of inaction as the difference in full-income losses and tuberculosis mortality between these two scenarios. FINDINGS: From 2020 to 2050, based on the current annual decrease in tuberculosis deaths of 2%, 318 million tuberculosis deaths (95% uncertainty interval 252 millionC395 million) are estimated to occur, corresponding to an economic loss of US$175 trillion (149 trillionC204 trillion). If the SDG tuberculosis mortality target is met in 2030, 238 million tuberculosis deaths (189 millionC295 million) and $131 trillion (112 trillionC153 trillion) in economic losses can be avoided. If the target is met in 2045, 181 million tuberculosis deaths (143 millionC224 million) and $102 trillion (87 trillionC118 trillion) can be avoided. The cost of inaction of not meeting the SDG tuberculosis mortality target until 2045 (vs 2030) is, therefore, 57 million tuberculosis deaths (51 millionC81 million) and $30 trillion (25 trillionC35 trillion) in economic losses. COVID-19-related disruptions add $2903 billion (2602 billionC5701 billion) to this cost. INTERPRETATION: Failure to achieve the SDG tuberculosis mortality target by 2030 will lead to profound economic and health losses. The effects of delay will be greatest in sub-Saharan Africa. Affected countries, donor nations, and the private sector should redouble efforts to finance tuberculosis programmes and research because the economic dividend of such strategies is likely to be substantial.

METHODS: The MeSH terms Nursing homes and COVID-19 were searched in MEDLINE Ovid, and English language articles were retrieved that were published between 1 March 2020 and 31 January 2021. Article titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers, and the results of included articles were grouped by themes. RESULTS: The search retrieved 348 articles, of which 76 were included in the thematic review. 8 articles related to COVID-19 disease characteristics (e.g. asymptomatic transmission), 24 to resident-related factors (e.g. comorbidities, nutrition, cognition), 13 to facility characteristics (e.g. physical space, occupancy, for-profit status), 21 to staffing (e.g. staffing levels, staff-to-resident ratio, staff multi-employment), and 10 to external factors (e.g. availability of personal protective equipment, prevailing health and social care policies). In terms of responses, identified themes included widespread testing, isolation and cohorting of residents, staff protection and support, promotion of residents well-being, and technological innovations. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 exerted severe challenges on the nursing home population and its staff. Both internal and external factors predisposed nursing homes to an increased propensity of spread. Numerous strategies were employed to attempt to mitigate the negative impacts.

The protocol of this scoping review was prospectively registered on 10th May 2020 in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/nfuh9). METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and pre-print repositories (bioRxiv and medRxiv) for simulation, pre-clinical and clinical studies on reverse CPR until 31st May 2020. RESULTS: We included 1 study on manikins, 31 case reports (29 during surgery requiring prone position) and 2 nonrandomized studies describing reverse CPR. No studies were found regarding reverse CPR in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the algorithms provided by the guidelines on basic and advanced life support remain valid in cardiac arrest in prone position, differences exist in the methods of performing CPR. There is no clear evidence of superiority in terms of effectiveness of reverse compared to supine CPR in patients with cardiac arrest occurring in prone position. The quality of evidence is low and knowledge gaps (e.g. protocols, training of healthcare personnel, devices for skill acquisition) should be fulfilled by further research.

METHODS: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of proportions using studies of adults hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or influenza pneumonia and followed up within 12 months. Searches performed in MEDLINE and Embase. Primary outcomes were proportion of radiological sequelae on CT scans; restrictive impairment; impaired gas transfer. Heterogeneity was explored in meta-regression. RESULTS: Ninety-five studies (98.9% observational) were included in qualitative synthesis, 70 were suitable for meta-analysis including 60 SARS-CoV-2 studies with a median follow-up of 3 months. In SARS-CoV-2, the overall estimated proportion of inflammatory sequelae was 50% during follow-up (0.50; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58; I(2)=95%), fibrotic sequelae were estimated in 29% (0.29; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.37; I(2)=94.1%). Follow-up time was significantly associated with estimates of inflammatory sequelae (?0.036; 95% CI ?0.068 to C0.004; p=0.029), associations with fibrotic sequelae did not reach significance (?0.021; 95% CI ?0.051 to 0.009; p=0.176).

However, current cortisol monitoring methods require expert personnel, large and complex machines, and long time for data analysis. Here, we present a flexible and wearable cortisol aptasensor for simple and rapid cortisol real-time monitoring. The sensing channel was produced by electrospinning conducting polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (NFs) and subsequent vapor deposition of carboxylated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The conjugation of the cortisol aptamer on the PEDOT-PAN NFs provided the critical sensing mechanism for the target molecule.

The sensor performance showed a detection limit of 10 pM (<5 s) and high selectivity in the presence of interference materials at 100 times higher concentrations. The practical usage and real-time monitoring of the cortisol aptasensor with a liquid-ion gated FET system was demonstrated by successful transfer to the swab and the skin. In addition, the real-time monitoring of actual sweat by applying the cortisol aptasensor was also successful since the aptasensor was able to detect cortisol approximately 1 nM from actual sweat in a few minutes.

POPULATION STUDIED: We purposefully sampled from community and children's hospitals serving pediatric patients in the 6 U.S. states with the highest COVID\\\\19 hospitalization rates at the onset of the pandemic (NY, NJ, DC, MA, CT, LA). We recruited 2 front\\\\line clinicians per site (mix of administrators, nurses, physicians). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty\\\\four participants from 12 hospitals were interviewed. The most commonly encountered themes are detailed in Table 1. Changes in healthcare delivery practices potentially impacting quality and safety of inpatient pediatric care included: 1) limits on family and caregiver visitation, which may have hindered gathering important details for diagnosis and engaging in shared\\\\decision making about management; 2) personal protective equipment and isolation practices, which may have compromised effective communication with caregivers and interpreters; 3) changes in quality improvement (QI) infrastructure and activities, with potential decreases in monitoring and safety efforts; 4) difficulties defining and providing high\\\\quality care for children with COVID\\\\19 and multi\\\\system inflammatory syndrome in children, both novel diagnoses; and 5) potential increases in safety events due to decreased direct contact with patients and monitoring (e.g., wound infections, central line\\\\associated bloodstream infections and catheter\\\\associated urinary tract infections).

Main outcome measures Sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics, COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and the scores of three validated scales which measured vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-related beliefs generally and specific to the participants' disease, including the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale and the Disease Influenced Vaccine Acceptance Scale. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the associations between scale scores and vaccine uptake. Results Of all participants, 81.5% reported having at least one COVID-19 vaccine. Unvaccinated status was associated with younger age, female sex, lower education and income, English as a second language, and residence in regional areas (all p<0.05). Unvaccinated participants were more likely to report greater vaccine hesitancy and more negative perceptions toward vaccines (all p<0.05).

RESULTS: During MCO, 41.2% of the respondents perceived that their eating patterns were healthier, but 36.3% reduced their physical activities, and 25.7% had a poorer sleep quality. Further, the proportion of adults who reported having lose weight (32.2%) was almost similar to those who reported having gained weight (30.7%). Lifestyle behaviours including less frequent practice of healthy cooking methods and lunch skipping were associated with weight gain, while less frequent consumption of high fat foods, more frequent physical activity, and good sleep latency were associated with lower risk of weight gain. In contrast, practicing healthy eating concept, skipped lunch, and more frequent physical activity were significantly associated with weight loss. CONCLUSION: Lifestyle behaviours were associated with body weight changes during MCO. While the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is necessary to prevent further spread of the disease, promoting healthy lifestyle practices during lockdown should be implemented for a healthy weight and better health.","output":"The impact of Movement Control Order during the COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle behaviours and body weight changes: Findings from the MyNutriLifeCOVID-19 online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has a major effect on nursing education in Indonesia, it needs for adaptation of the curriculum to achieve competent nursing graduates meet national and international standards.

While resuscitation with 40C60 mL/kg intravenous fluid boluses remains a cornerstone of initial resuscitation, an increasing body of evidence indicates potential for harm related to high volume fluid administration. We hypothesize that a protocol on early use of inotropes in children with septic shock is feasible and will lead to less fluid bolus use compared to standard fluid resuscitation. Here, we describe the protocol of the Early Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Inotropes C A Randomised Controlled Pilot Study in the Emergency Department (RESPOND ED). Methods and analysis: The RESPOND ED study is an open label randomised controlled, two arm, multicentre pilot study conducted at four specialised paediatric Emergency Departments. Forty children aged between 28 days and 18 years treated for presumed septic shock will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to early inotropes vs. standard fluid resuscitation. Early inotrope treatment is defined as the commencement of a continuous intravenous adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation. Standard fluid resuscitation is defined as delivery of 40 to 60 mL/kg fluid bolus resuscitation prior to commencement of inotropes. In addition to feasibility outcomes, survival free of organ dysfunction censored at 28 days will be assessed as the main clinical outcome. The study cohort will be followed up at 28 days, and at 6 months post enrolment to assess quality of life and functional status. Biobanking nested in the study cohort will be performed to enable ancillary biomarker studies.

Such a study should be helpful to access the effectiveness of measures conducted to suppress the pandemic at a local scale. METHODS: We have performed extrapolation of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the first stable set of data exploiting exponential growth (linear in logarithmic scale). Based on obtained coefficients it is performed prediction of a number of cases until the end of March. After initial exponential growth, we have changed predictive model to the generalized gamma function. Obtained results are compared with the number of infections and the prediction for the remainder of the outbreak is given. FINDINGS: We have found that the daily growth rate was above 21.5% at the beginning of the period, increased slightly after the introduction of the State of Emergency and the first set of strict epidemical control measures. It took about 13 days after the first set of strict measures to smooth daily growth. It seems that early government measures had an only moderate impact to reduce growth due to the social behavior of citizens and influx of diaspora returning to Serbia from highly affected areas, i.e., the exponential growth of infected persons is kept but with a reduced slope of about 14-15%. Anyway, it is demonstrated that period required that any measure has effect is up to 15 days after introduction, firstly to exponential growth with a smaller rate and after to smooth function representing the number of infected persons below exponential growth rate. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained results are consistent with findings from other countries, i.e., initial exponential growth slows down within the presumed incubation period of 2 weeks after adopting lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical epidemiological measures. However, it is also shown that the exponential growth can continue after this period with a smaller slope. Therefore, quarantine and other social distancing measures should be adopted as soon as possible in a case of any similar outbreak since alternatives mean prolonged epidemical situation and growing costs in human life, pressure on the health system, economy, etc. For modeling the remainder of the outbreak generalized gamma function is used showing accurate results but requiring more samples and pre-processing (data filtering) concerning exponential part of the outbreak.

We aimed to document patterns in hospital activity by psychiatric disorder and how these have changed over the last 22 years. METHODS: In this observational time series analysis, we used routinely collected data on all NHS hospitals in England from 1998/99 to 2019/20. Trends in hospital admissions and bed days for psychiatric disorders were smoothed using negative binomial regression models with year as the exposure and rates (per 1000 person-years) as the outcome. When linear trends were not appropriate, we fitted segmented negative binomial regression models with one change-point. We stratified by gender and age group [children (0C14 years); adults (15 years +)]. RESULTS: Hospital admission rates and bed days for all psychiatric disorders decreased by 28.4 and 38.3%, respectively. Trends were not uniform across psychiatric disorders or age groups. Admission rates mainly decreased over time, except for anxiety and eating disorders which doubled over the 22-year period, significantly increasing by 2.9% (AAPC = 2.88; 95% CI: 2.61C3.16; p < 0.001) and 3.4% (AAPC = 3.44; 95% CI: 3.04C3.85; p < 0.001) each year. Inpatient hospital activity among children showed more increasing and pronounced trends than adults, including an increase of 212.9% for depression, despite a 63.8% reduction for adults with depression during the same period. CONCLUSION: In the last 22 years, there have been overall reductions in hospital activity for psychiatric disorders.

Initially, four cells-two  cells and their sisters, the ? cells-have the potential to be the AC. The ? cells rapidly lose AC potential and invariably become ventral uterine precursor cells (VUs), while the two  cells interact via LIN-12/Notch in the \\"AC/VU decision\\" to resolve which will be the AC and which will become another VU. HLH-2 protein stability is dynamically regulated in cells with AC potential; initially present in all four cells, HLH-2 is degraded in presumptive VUs while remaining stable in the sole AC. Here, we demonstrate that stability of HLH-2 protein is regulated by the activity of lin-12/Notch in both  and ? cells, providing evidence that activation of LIN-12 in an  cell promotes degradation of HLH-2 as part of a negative feedback loop during the AC/VU decision in  cells, and that ectopic stabilization of HLH-2 promotes AC fate in ? cells. We also performed an RNAi screen of 232 ubiquitin-related genes and identified seven genes that contribute to HLH-2 degradation in VUs. When HLH-2 is stabilized by RNAi-depletion of ubiquitin ligases in a lin-12(+) background, there are no supernumerary ACs, suggesting that LIN-12 activation does not oppose hlh-2 activity solely by causing HLH-2 protein degradation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hlh-2 transcription is negatively regulated in ? cells independent of lin-12 activity. Together, our results indicate that hlh-2 activity is regulated at multiple levels to restrict the AC fate to a single cell.","output":"Influences of HLH-2 stability on anchor cell fate specification during Caenorhabditis elegans gonadogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to quantify protein-ligand interactions in an accurate and high-throughput manner is important in diverse areas of biology and medicine.

The indication for treatment was age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 60 eyes (19.8%), while 162 eyes (53.5%) had Diabetic Macular Edema, 71 eyes (23.4%) had Retinal Vein Occlusion and 10 eyes (3.3%) had other diagnosis. The visual acuity in the treatment na?ve eyes (Group A, n = 168) was significantly worse (P <0.001) than those who presented for retreatment (Group B, n = 135). In Group B, there was a significant decline in vision for the entire cohort (P = 0.009) and those with AMD (P = 0.036). Those in Group B presented at a mean interval of 19.1  10.6 (range, 4-64) weeks for retreatment. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in patients receiving anti-VEGF injections. The visual acuity is worse in both treatment na?ve as well as those requiring retreatment. This could have long-term impact on vision of patients requiring this vision preserving treatment.","output":"Profile of patients receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections during COVID-19-related lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Digital medicine describes a field concerned with the use of technologies as tools for measurement, and intervention in the service of human health. Digital medicine products are driven by high-quality hardware and software that support the practice of medicine broadly, including treatment, recovery, disease prevention, and health promotion for individuals and across populations. Digital medicine products can be used independently or in concert with pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, or other products to optimize patient care and health outcomes. Digital medicine empowers patients and healthcare providers with intelligent and accessible tools to address a wide range of conditions through high-quality, safe, and effective measurements and data-driven interventions. As a discipline, digital medicine encapsulates both broad professional expertise and responsibilities concerning the use of these digital tools. Digital medicine focuses on evidence-generation to support the use of these technologies.

In the conditions mentioned, many people are on long-term treatment with agents including hydroxychloroquine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitor drugs, other biologic agents such as monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and Janus kinase inhibitors including baricitinib and tofacitinib, which are used to control inflammatory responses in their respective auto-immune condition. There is emerging data that immunomodulatory drugs could be protective at reducing certain features of SARS-CoV-2 and improving recovery. In addition, it is important to understand if subjects being treated with the immunomodulatory agents described have a less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they are deemed some protection from their immunomodulatory treatment, or if they develop infections similar to non-immunocompromised patients. There is a huge unmet clinical need to advise patients responsibly about whether they should remain on their immunomodulatory treatment or not in light of Covid-19 infection.

To achieve this, we used a time to event analysis to arrive at factors that could alter the length of hospital stay, aiding in planning additional beds for any future rise in cases. METHODS: Information about COVID-19 patients was collected between June and August 2020. The response variable was the time from admission to discharge of patients. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the factors that were associated with the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 730 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 675 (92.5%) recovered and 55 (7.5%) were considered to be right-censored, that is, the patient died or was discharged against medical advice. The median length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized was found to be 7 days by the Kaplan Meier curve. The covariates that prolonged the length of hospital stay were found to be abnormalities in oxygen saturation (HR = 0.446, P < .001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 0.742, P = .003), levels of D-dimer (HR = 0.60, P = .002), lactate dehydrogenase (HR = 0.717, P = .002), and ferritin (HR = 0.763, P = .037). Also, patients who had more than 2 chronic diseases had a significantly longer length of stay (HR = 0.586, P = .008) compared to those with no comorbidities.

Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic? For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity [Formula: see text] of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with [Formula: see text] could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy.

The present study aimed to explore the kinetics of IL-6 levels, validate this association in COVID-19 patients, and report preliminary data on the efficacy of IL-6 receptor blockade. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institutional study of 901 consecutive confirmed cases. Serum IL-6 concentrations were tested on admission and/or during hospital stay. Tocilizumab was given to 16 patients with elevated IL-6 concentration. RESULTS: 366 patients were defined as common cases, 411 patients as severe, and 124 patients as critical according to the Chinese guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The median concentration of IL-6 was < 1.5 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50C2.15), 1.85 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50C5.21), and 21.55 pg/ml (IQR 6.47C94.66) for the common, severe, and critical groups respectively (P < 0.001). The follow-up kinetics revealed serum IL-6 remained high in critical patients even when cured. An IL-6 concentration higher than 37.65 pg/ml was predictive of in-hospital death (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.95C0.99], P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 95.7%. In the 16 patients who received tocilizumab, IL-6 concentrations were significantly increased after administration, and survival outcome was not significantly different from that of propensity-score matched counterparts (n = 53, P = 0.12).

METHODS: On February 28, 2020, contingency plans were implemented at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, the decision to refrain from reallocating the Stroke Team and Stroke Unit to the care of patients with COVID-19. From March 1 to March 31, 2020, we measured the number of emergency calls to the Emergency Medical System in Catalonia (7.5 million inhabitants), and the Stroke Codes dispatched to Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. We recorded all stroke admissions, and the adequacy of acute care measures, including the number of thrombectomies, workflow metrics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes. Data were compared with March 2019 using parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate. RESULTS: At Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, 1232 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in March 2020, demanding 60% of the hospital bed capacity. Relative to March 2019, the Emergency Medical System had a 330% mean increment in the number of calls (158 005 versus 679 569), but fewer Stroke Code activations (517 versus 426). Stroke admissions (108 versus 83) and the number of thrombectomies (21 versus 16) declined at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, particularly after lockdown of the population. Younger age was found in stroke admissions during the pandemic (median [interquartile range] 69 [64C73] versus 75 [73C80] years, P=0.009). In-hospital, there were no differences in workflow metrics, angiographic results, complications, or outcomes at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced by a quarter the stroke admissions and thrombectomies performed at a Comprehensive Stroke Center but did not affect the quality of care metrics. During the lockdown, there was an overload of emergency calls but fewer Stroke Code activations, particularly in elderly patients.

METHOD: In October 2020 the trust appointed four EGS Consultants forming a dedicated acute general surgical service. Emphasis was placed on creating ambulatory pathways and those patients safe to be managed at home but requiring surgical intervention are placed on a day case RAT list. COVID-19 has restricted the broad use of this service for all emergency admissions but biliary pathology continues to be amenable to these pathways. Data was collected retrospectively using in-house coding and electronic patient database systems. RESULTS: 34 day case laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in the first 10 weeks.

The primary aim was to explore the feasibility of conducting a pulmonary rehabilitation program in patients with coronavirus disease-19 pneumonia surviving intensive care. The secondary aim was to study the impact of a hospital-based 6-week pulmonary rehabilitation program on exercise capacity, quality of life, and psychological parameters in these patients. This study was conducted at the Center for Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Department of Pulmonary Medicine of the institute. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Among them, 14 patients who completed the desired 12 sessions over 6 weeks constituted the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 13 patients who either did not consent or defaulted within the first 2 weeks were considered as controls. Both groups had assessments at 0 and 6 weeks that included a 6-Minute Walk Test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, mMRC Dyspnea Scale, Baseline Dyspnea Index, and Transitional Dyspnea Index, Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 score. RESULTS Significant improvement in dyspnea by mMRC (P = .01) and exercise capacity as measured by 6-Minute Walk Test (P <.001) and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (P = .025) was seen in the pulmonary rehabilitation group as compared to the control group.

They may occur transiently in gene creation and are of biotechnological interest. We have examined the possibility to encode an arbitrary pair of protein domains as a dual gene, with the shorter coding sequence completely embedded in the longer one. For 500  500 domain pairs (X, Y), we computationally designed homologous pairs (X, Y) coded this way, using an algorithm that provably maximizes the sequence similarity between (X, Y) and (X, Y). Three schemes were considered, with X and Y coded on the same or complementary strands. For 16% of the pairs, an overlapping coding exists where the level of homology of X, Y to the natural proteins represents an E-value of 10(?10) or better. Thus, for an arbitrary domain pair, it is surprisingly easy to design homologous sequences that can be encoded as a fully-overlapping gene pair. The algorithm is general and was used to design 200 triple genes, with three proteins encoded by the same DNA segment. The ease of design suggests overlapping genes may have occurred frequently in evolution and could be readily used to compress or constrain artificial genomes.","output":"Computational design of fully overlapping coding schemes for protein pairs and triplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severity and fatality of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection are not the same in the infected population. The host immune response and Immune-stimulating factors appear to play a role in COVID-19 infection outcome. insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) affects the immune system by controlling the endocrine system. Recently, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis has been considered. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference between circulating IGF-1 and inflammatory cytokines concentration among COVID-19 patients, infected patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (n = 40; 35  5 y) and patients with mild cases of COVID-19 (n = 40; 35  5 y) were screened prior to participation in the study. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender and preexisting inflammatory state. Collected samples were evaluated by ELISA for IGF-1 and IL-6. RESULTS: The study outcomes included a significant decrease in IGF-1 and an increase in IL-6 serum concentration, as an inflammatory marker, for infected patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (P  0.001). Finally, there was a significant increase in the IGF-1 and a decrease in the IL-6 serum concentration of hospitalized patients. DISCUSSION: it appears that inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) serum concentration in the severe form of corona virus-based infections causes reduced defenses because of suppressed IGF-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that lower IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a Severe form of COVID-19 disease. It seems, IGF-1 supplementation or anti-inflammatory treatment rescued the severe form of COVID-19 infection.

The present study aims at investigating how did the leadership use prosocial empathic skills during this pandemic to manage the mental well-being of their respective employees, so that they are motivated and engaged for meaningful performance. The major themes that emerged from the structured interviews of the apex leadership were (1) compassionate empathic behaviour impacts the employee motivation and performance; (2) open, honest and timely vertical communication promotes trust and bonding; (3) support for employee autonomy impacts their well-being; (4) encouraging competence and self-efficacy in employees; (5) promoting positive and healthy relationships by displaying compassionate empathy positively impacts mental health and thereby employee performance during crisis. Right from providing unified Communication platform, to displaying empathic leadership, the apex leadership unanimously believes that people are their best assets and if managed well in the crisis can help them stem the storm successfully.

METHODS: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August 2020 in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods. Participants were selected at random to provide blood for Elecsys immunoassay for detection of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibodies. A Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district. RESULTS: In total, 3005 participants from 623 households were enrolled in this study. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-13.1] and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4-21.7) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively, compared with 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0-1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3-17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low- and high-transmission areas, respectively. The conditional risk of infection was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41 (95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low- and high-transmission neighbourhoods, respectively, in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. The infection fatality rate was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This clinical retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All patient data were obtained from the patient files and anesthesia follow-up forms. Demographic datas, intraoperative fluids, blood products requirement and blood gas parameters were recorded. RESULTS A total 15 of 103 patients data were lack, the remaining 88 patients were evaluated. Combination of crystalloid and colloid was used for intravenous fluid management. About 11% of patients required transfusion during surgery. The mean pH and pO2 values of the patients were observed to decrease whereas pCO2 and lactate values increased. DISCUSSION Radical Prostatectomy can be performed either using open technique as a traditional approach or laparoscopic or robot-assisted technique as a minimally invasive approach. Today, minimally invasive approaches have replaced traditional open prostatectomy. Anaesthesia management of these minimally invasive techniques is very different and challenging from open technique in many aspects. CONCLUSION Although minimally invasive techniques have good surgical outcomes such as less blood loss, smaller surgical incision, and shorter hospitalization, these techniques bring new problems that anesthesiologists have to deal with. Increased RARP operations has led to the anesthesiologists more likely to encounter perioperative problems.

In this study, an environmental-friendly, economical, non-toxic, and practical finishing on medical textiles with potent virucidal activity was proposed with the combined concepts of a new green synthesis of TiO(2)@Ag core-shell nanostructures using ascorbic acid reduction and UV-curing process. In order to evaluate efficiency of virucidal activity, effects of the amount of TiO(2)@Ag NPs and contact time were determined against the coronavirus following ISO 18184:2019 standard. The finishing agent exhibited an excellent 99.9% virucidal efficacy. The stability of virucidal activity and mechanical properties were determined under repeated washing. The finished fabrics had the ability to retain their virucidal activity and tensile strength through 20 washes.

The aim is to provide to interested scientists from different fields, including chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and medicine, an overview over the basic properties of surfactants and (corona)viruses, which are relevant to understanding the interactions between the two. Various types of interactions between surfactant and virus are important, and they act on different components of a virus such as the lipid envelope, membrane (envelope) proteins and nucleo-capsid proteins. Accordingly, this cannot be a detailed account of all relevant aspects, but instead a summary that bridges between the different disciplines. We describe concepts and cover a selection of the relevant literature as an incentive for diving deeper into the relevant material. Our focus is on more recent developments around the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, applications of surfactants against the virus, and on the potential future use of surfactants for pandemic relief. However, we also cover the most important aspects of the historical development of using surfactants in combatting virus infections. We conclude that surfactants are already playing very important roles in various directions of defence against viruses, either directly, as in disinfection, or as carrier components of drug delivery systems for prophylaxis or treatment. By designing tailor-made surfactants and, consequently, advanced formulations, one can expect a more and more effective use of surfactants, either directly as antiviral compounds or as part of more complex formulations.","output":"\\"Surfactants - compounds for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have developed deep learning models to classify COVID-19 induced pneumonia.

The ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure has been used to secure the fetal airway and minimize neonatal hypoxia, but is associated with increased maternal morbidity. CASE PRESENTATION A 16-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) was referred to our hospital at 31 weeks gestation with fetal anomalies, including echogenic lungs, tracheobronchial dilation and flattened diaphragms. At 32 weeks, fetoscopic evaluation identified laryngeal stenosis, which was subsequently treated with balloon dilation and stent placement. The patient developed symptomatic and regular preterm contractions at post-operative day 7 with persistent sonographic signs of CHAOS, which prompted a repeat fetoscopy with confirmation of a patent fetal airway followed by Cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia. Attempts to intubate through the tracheal stent were limited and resulted in removal of the stent. A neonatal airway was successfully established with rigid bronchoscopy. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy confirmed laryngeal stenosis with a small tracheoesophageal fistula immediately inferior to the laryngeal stenosis and significant tracheomalacia. A tracheostomy was then immediately performed for anticipated long term airway and pulmonary management. The procedures were well tolerated by both mom and baby. The baby demonstrated spontaneous healing of the tracheoesophageal fistula by day of life 7 with discharge home with ventilator support at three months of life. CONCLUSION Use of repeated fetoscopy in order to relieve fetal upper airway obstruction offers the potential to minimize neonatal hypoxia, while concurrently decreasing maternal morbidity by avoiding an EXIT procedure. Use of the tracheal stent in CHAOS requires further investigation. The long-term reconstruction and respiratory support of children with CHAOS remain challenging.","output":"Fetoscopic balloon dilation and stent placement of congenital high airway obstruction syndrome leading to successful Caesarian delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a clear need for high-throughput, multiplexed, and sensitive assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses as well as their emerging variants.

Using dynamic stimuli with increasing temporal delay (SOA) between the onset of the first and second element in a symmetric pair, we investigated how four different luminance-polarity conditions affected the temporal integration of symmetric patterns. All four luminance polarity conditions showed similar upper temporal limits of approximately 60 ms. However psychophysical performance over all delay durations showed significantly higher symmetry thresholds for unmatched-polarity patterns at short delays, but also significantly less sensitivity to increasing temporal delay relative to matched-polarity patterns. These varying temporal windows are consistent with the involvement of a fast, sensitive first-order mechanism for matched-polarity patterns, and a slower, more robust second-order mechanism for unmatched-polarity patterns. Temporal integration windows for unmatched-polarity patterns were not consistent with performance expected from attentional mechanisms alone, and instead supports the involvement of second-order mechanisms that combines information from ON and OFF channels.","output":"The temporal integration windows for visual mirror symmetry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a public health crisis of global proportion. In psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents, evidence is not yet available on susceptibility to infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and data about the perception of COVID-19 and its impact on these patients are lacking. AIMS: The aim of this observational, spontaneous study was the evaluation of the impact of anti COVID-19 measures in \\"fragile population\\" such as patients with a chronic inflammatory disease. Thus, we evaluated the impact of perceived risk on quality of life of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, in our outpatient clinic, and how their perceptions changed before and after the adoption of Covid-19 emergency measures following the Italian Ministerial Decree in March 9, 2020. METHODS: Using a series of questions, our study surveyed adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving treatment with biologic agents (na?=a?591), before and after the adoption of COVID-19 emergency measures. RESULTS: Most patients (97%) had been sufficiently informed by healthcare staff about COVID-19 spread. A significant change was observed in social activity reduction before and after the adoption of the measures (18% vs. 90% of patients; Pa?<a?0.0001). Similarly, patients were more likely to suspend ongoing therapy after the measures were adopted than before (87% vs. 34% of patients; Pa?<a?0.0001). Following the measures, older patients were significantly more inclined to suspend therapy and reduce social activities than younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Government COVID-19 emergency measures further curtailed already reduced social activities in psoriatic patients, and led to a greater inclination to suspend biologic therapy, more so in older patients, despite there being no evidence to support this suspension.

In the constant effort to improve the outcome of complex aneurysm treatment, flow-diverting stents (FDSs) have emerged in recent years as the preferred treatment. Instead of directly obstructing the flow of blood into the aneurysmal sac, as is the case for stent- and balloon-assisted coiling, FDSs are placed in the parent blood vessel to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm itself. Subsequent to the diverting away of blood from the aneurysm, a thrombotic cascade ensues that ultimately results in the closure of the aneurysm while the parent vessel's perforators are preserved.

As adult patients have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, pediatric practitioners world-wide have stepped forward to support their adult colleagues. In general, standalone pediatric hospitals expanded their capacity to centralize pediatric critical care, decanting patients from other institutions. There are few units that ran a hybrid model, managing both adult and pediatric patients with the same PICU staff. In this report, we describe the hybrid model implemented at our respective institutions with shared experiences, pitfalls, challenges, and adjustments required in caring for both young and older patients. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Two PICUs in urban tertiary hospitals in London and New York. PATIENTS Adult and pediatric patients admitted to the PICU in roughly a 6-week period during the coronavirus disease 2019 surge. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The PICU at King's College Hospital admitted 23 non-coronavirus disease adult patients, while whereas the PICU at Morgan Stanley's Children Hospital in New York admitted 46 adults, 30 of whom were coronavirus disease positive. The median age of adult patients at King's College Hospital was higher than those admitted in New York, 53 years (19-77 yr) and 24.4 years (18-52 yr), respectively. Catering to the different physical, emotional, and social needs of both children and adults by the same PICU team was challenging. One important consideration in both locations was the continued care of patients with severe non-coronavirus disease-related illnesses such as neurosurgical emergencies, trauma, and septic shock. Furthermore, retention of critical specialists such as transplant services allowed for nine and four solid organ transplants to occur in London and New York, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This hybrid model successfully allowed for the expansion into adult critical care while maintaining essential services for critically ill children.

METHODS We used EQ-5D-Y DCE and C-TTO data collected in Spain following the protocol and adopted a staged approach for our modeling exercise. First, we selected the best performing DCE latent class model and evaluated models from 2 to 10 classes. We selected the preferred model based on best goodness of fit in terms of the Bayesian information criterion. We considered 2 anchoring approaches to estimate utility values: (1) pits state anchoring and (2) hybrid models (using all available C-TTO responses).

The results reveal some crucial characteristics of the apps. First, type-Q response is successful in achieving containment; however, type-T response has a limited curve-flattening effect. Second, type-Q response performs better than type-T response because it involves quarantine of those who are infected but have not become infectious yet, and the current testing technology cannot detect the virus in these individuals. Third, if the download rate of the apps is extremely high, type-Q response can achieve virus containment with a small number of quarantined people and thereby high efficiency. Finally, given a fixed download rate, increasing the number of tests per day enhances the effectiveness of the apps, although the degree of improved effectiveness is not proportional to the change in the number of tests.","output":"Modeling the effects of contact-tracing apps on the spread of the coronavirus disease: Mechanisms, conditions, and efficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to increase patient safety and satisfaction, a critical concern for health providers, require periodic evaluation of all factors involved in the provision of GI endoscopy services.

A very high level of binding occurred in the meninges, choroid plexus, pineal gland, paraventricular nucleus and pituitary gland. Moderate to high labeling was also observed in the cortex, caudateCputamen, subthalamic nucleus, central periaqueductal gray, thalamus, as well as in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord, which are known to contain a high concentration of enkephalins, opioid receptors and neutral endopeptidase. This co-localization confirms the physiological implication of aminopeptidase N in the inactivation of enkephalins accounting for the requirement of dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N to observe highly significant morphine-like effects induced by the protected endogenous opioid peptides. Aminopeptidase N was also visualized in moderate to high levels in other brain structures such as the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, hypothalamus (dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei), raphe nucleus, pontine nucleus, inferior olive, and in high concentration in the granular layer of cerebellum. In summary, aminopeptidase N has been visualized for the first time in numerous brain areas using the selective inhibitor [(125)I]RB 129. This iodinated probe could allow the ex vivo and in vivo localization of aminopeptidase N in various tissues to be investigated and may also be used to evaluate quantitative changes in aminopeptidase N expression in pathological situations.

Methods RT-qPCR assays and molecular sequencing methods were used to identify HRV and HEV strains in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 309 hospitalized pediatric patients with microbiologically unexplained ARTIs and in 210 hospitalized pediatric patients without respiratory symptoms from September 2009 to June 2010 in France. Results Among the 309 ARTI cases, 15 HEV and 172 HRV strains were identified whereas only 1 HEV and 37 HRV strains were observed in control patients (187 vs. 38: P < 10?3). HRV strains were identified in 150 of the 164 lower ARTIs whereas HEV strains were identified in only 14 of these cases. Among bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases (n = 133), HEV infected cases were older (Median age (months) 36 vs. 11, P = 0.003) and were more frequently associated with a respiratory distress (P = 0.01) and a need for oxygen supply at the time of admission (P = 0.01) than cases infected by HRV strains.

Since a broad spectrum of patients present to primary health-care services, testing for patients with noninfluenza-like illness and atypical presentations is debatable. Hence, there is an urgent need for documenting the early presenting symptoms of COVID-19 among patients seeking medical care in primary health-care settings.Aim:In this study, we aim to document the early symptoms of patients with COVID-19 and the proportion of asymptomatic infection in family medicine centers in South India.Design:This is a retrospective study of the early symptoms of patients who tested positive between June and December 2020. The data and clinical notes of patients were retrieved from the hospital information system.Setting:This study was undertaken by the Department of Family Medicine (DFM) in a private not-for-profit academic institution in South India. The DFM provides primary and secondary health-care services to nearly 1,50,000 patients from the local urban communities.Results:A total of 330 patients were tested for COVID-19 and the study included 94 patients who tested positive. Around 37% participants were asymptomatic. The commonest symptom was fever (58.6%), followed by tiredness/myalgia (48.3%), loss of taste or smell or appetite (43.1%), and cough or cold (37.9%).

Different degrees of liver injury or liver dysfunctions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, currently, it remains unclear to what extent liver diseases should be considered as significant risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Moreover, the mechanisms involved in liver injury in severe COVID-19 infection are not yet well understood. AREA COVERED This review summarizes the current evidence on liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and the effects of pre-existing liver disease on the disease severity. This review also illustrates the possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver injury, as well as provides recommendations to prevent liver damage in COVID-19 infection. EXPERT OPINION The elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin are common in more severe patients than non-severe or mild COVID-19 patients. Patients with pre-existing medical conditions including chronic hepatic diseases are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection. The drug's effects, possible viral inclusion in liver cells, systemic inflammation and hypoxia are potential causes of liver injury in severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, further studies are needed focusing on the pre-existing hepatic diseases on prevention, treatment and outcome of COVID-19.","output":"Liver injury in severe COVID-19 infection: current insights and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there have been changes to NHS services to limit unnecessary patient hospital visits and comply with new social restriction rules. One of these changes has been the introduction of virtual consultations in outpatient clinics to replace traditional face to face appointments. Methods A retrospective analysis of patient feedback from adult outpatient virtual appointments in a 4-month period was collated and reviewed (May-September 2020). After an appointment, patients were sent a text message asking for feedback. The text consisted of one main question asking patients to rate their experience and a comment section. The data from this brief patient survey was obtained for all rheumatology patient responses. At the end of the text there was a link for a more comprehensive online survey which patients could fill out if they wish to provide more detailed feedback. Responses to this survey encompasses all adult outpatient specialities including musculoskeletal services. Results There were 269 responses to the detailed patient survey from various adult outpatient clinics. The most common type of virtual consultation was telephone which was the case in 79%, of which 91% of patients stated the caller was polite and 89% felt they had an opportunity to ask questions. When asked what their overall view 43% of patients stated they would not mind conducting all future appointments via telephone, 23.5% felt that in the current situation a telephone consultation was acceptable but would have preferred a face to face and 7% were completely unsatisfied. From the musculoskeletal group there were 36 responses (20 orthopaedic, 15 rheumatology and 1 musculoskeletal). 92% of patients stated they were given the opportunity to ask questions and 86% were satisfied with the advice given to them. 33% (n = 12) stated they would not mind having virtual consultations in the future even after the pandemic, but 28% stated they would have preferred a face to face consultation. There were 784 responses to the shorter patient survey via text message from rheumatology patients. When asked to rate their experience 94% (n = 739) of patients stated it was either good or very good, and only 1% said it was poor or very poor. There were largely positive comments in the feedback. Most frequent points were patients felt listened to, communication was good and virtual consultations were less stressful. Conclusion At present the use of virtual clinics seems to be well received by patients and most importantly their quality of care is not compromised. From a patients perspective there are many benefits and cumulative feedback so far suggests that majority of the patients are willing to adapt to this new approach to outpatient appointments both now and post-COVID-19.

MethodsAn on-line cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece during August 2021. We collected socio-demographic data of HCWs and we measured attitudes towards vaccination and COVID-19, knowledge and trust. We used a convenience sample since we distributed the questionnaire through social media and e-mails. ResultsStudy population included 855 HCWs. The majority of HCWs were vaccinated against the COVID-19 (91.5%). According to multivariate analysis, females, HCWs without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and HCWs with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, increased self-perceived knowledge regarding COVID-19 and increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines and government regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, HCWs with more concerns about the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination were more reluctant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.

Increased levels of circulating neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuronal injury, have been observed in severe COVID\\\\19 patients. We investigated whether NfL provides non\\\\redundant clinical value to previously identified predictors of COVID\\\\19 mortality. METHODS: We measured serum or plasma NfL concentrations in a blinded fashion in 3 cohorts totaling 338 COVID\\\\19 patients. RESULTS: In cohort 1, we found significantly elevated NfL levels only in critically ill COVID\\\\19 patients. Longitudinal cohort 2 data showed that NfL is elevated late in the course of the disease, following the two other prognostic markers of COVID\\\\19: decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant correlations between ALC and LDH abnormalities and subsequent rise of NfL implicate that the multi\\\\organ failure is the most likely cause of neuronal injury in severe COVID\\\\19 patients. The addition of NfL to age and gender in cohort 1 significantly improved the accuracy of mortality prediction and these improvements were validated in cohorts 2 and 3. INTERPRETATION: A substantial increase in serum/plasma NfL reproducibly enhanced COVID\\\\19 mortality prediction. Combined with other prognostic markers, such as ALC and LDH that are routinely measured in ICU patients, NfL measurements might be useful to identify the patients at a high risk of COVID\\\\19\\\\associated mortality, who might still benefit from escalated care.","output":"Prognostic value of serum/plasma neurofilament light chain for COVID\\\\19\\\\associated mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination roll-out strategies is essential for a rapid recovery.

Thus, we developed a new method for the discovery of unknown viruses based on the cDNA - random amplified polymorphic DNA (cDNA-RAPD) technique. Getah virus, belonging to the family Togaviridae in the genus Alphavirus, is a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus that was identified using the Virus-Discovery-cDNA RAPD (VIDISCR) method. RESULTS: A novel Getah virus was identified by VIDISCR from suckling mice exposed to mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) collected in Yunnan Province, China. The non-structural protein gene, nsP3, the structural protein gene, the capsid protein gene, and the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the novel Getah virus isolate were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence identities of each gene were determined to be 97.1C99.3%, 94.9C99.4%, and 93.6C99.9%, respectively, when compared with the genomes of 10 other representative strains of Getah virus. CONCLUSIONS: The VIDISCR method was able to identify known virus isolates and a novel isolate of Getah virus from infected mice.

This is the first trans-national study exploring the qualitative experiences and challenges of using social media while in lockdown or shelter-in-place during the current pandemic. Methods: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional online survey conducted in Norway, the UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. The manuscript reports on the qualitative free-text component of the study asking about the challenges of social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, USA and Australia. A total of 1991 responses were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. Results: Three overarching themes identified were: Emotional/Mental Health, Information and Being Connected. Participants experienced that using social media during the pandemic amplified anxiety, depression, fear, panic, anger, frustration and loneliness. They felt that there was information overload and social media was full of misleading or polarized opinions which were difficult to switch off. Nonetheless, participants also thought that there was an urge for connection and learning, which was positive and stressful at the same time. Conclusion: Using social media while in a shelter-in-place or lockdown could have a negative impact on the emotional and mental health of some of the population. To support policy and practice in strengthening mental health care in the community, social media could be used to deliver practical advice on coping and stress management. Communication with the public should be strengthened by unambiguous and clear messages and clear communication pathways.

These enzymes catalyse S-acylation in a two-step process involving auto-acylation of the cysteine residue in the catalytic DHHC motif followed by transfer of the acyl chain to a substrate cysteine. S-acylation is essential for many fundamental physiological processes, and there is growing interest in zDHHC enzymes as novel drug targets for a range of disorders. However, there is currently a lack of chemical modulators of S-acylation either for use as tool compounds or for potential development for therapeutic purposes. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel FRET-based high throughput assay for the discovery of compounds that interfere with auto-acylation of zDHHC2, an enzyme that is implicated in neuronal S-acylation pathways. A screen of >350,000 compounds identified two related tetrazole containing compounds (TTZ-1 and -2) that inhibited both zDHHC2 auto-acylation and substrate S-acylation in cell-free systems. Furthermore, these compounds were also active in HEK293T cells, where they inhibited substrate S-acylation mediated by different zDHHC enzymes, with some apparent isoform selectivity. Resynthesis of the hit compounds confirmed their activity, providing sufficient quantities of material for further investigations. The assays developed herein provide novel strategies to screen for zDHHC inhibitors, and the identified compounds add to the chemical toolbox for interrogating the cellular activities of S-acylation and zDHHC enzymes.","output":"Development of a novel high-throughput screen for the identification of new inhibitors of protein S-acylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically changed the way of living of billions of people in a very short time frame. In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities that are carried out on-line. The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are also included. The analysis of a large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network can be significant, especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed that the standard deviation of the average additional delay C the additional time with respect to the minimum delay of the paths in the region C during lockdown is  3 ? 4 times as much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, in Italy, packet loss is  2 ? 3 times as much as before the pandemic.

To date, measurement of this distress has largely been by means of validated assessment tools. We believe that qualitative data may provide a richer view of staff experiences during this pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study using online and written questionnaires to all ICU staff which consisted of validated tools to measure psychological distress (quantitative findings) and open-ended questions with free-text boxes (qualitative findings). Here, we report our qualitative findings. We asked four questions to explore causes of stress, need for supports and barriers to accessing supports. A conventional content analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 269 of the 408 respondents (65.9%) gave at least one response to a free-text question. Seven overarching themes were found, which contribute to our proposed model for occupational stress amongst critical care staff. The work environment played an important role in influencing the perceived psychological impact on healthcare workers. Extra-organisational factors, which we termed the home-work interface and uncertainty about the future, manifested as anticipatory anxiety, had a proportionally larger influence on worker well-being than would be expected in non-pandemic conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings have important implications for appropriate allocation of resources and ensuring well-being of the ICU multidisciplinary team for this and future pandemics.","output":"A model for occupational stress amongst paediatric and adult critical care staff during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide range of RNA viruses use programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshifting for the production of viral fusion proteins. Inspection of the overlap regions between ORF1a and ORF1b of the SARS-CoV genome revealed that, similar to all coronaviruses, a programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshift could be used by the virus to produce a fusion protein. Computational analyses of the frameshift signal predicted the presence of an mRNA pseudoknot containing three double-stranded RNA stem structures rather than two. Phylogenetic analyses showed the conservation of potential three-stemmed pseudoknots in the frameshift signals of all other coronaviruses in the GenBank database. Though the presence of the three-stemmed structure is supported by nuclease mapping and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance studies, our findings suggest that interactions between the stem structures may result in local distortions in the A-form RNA. These distortions are particularly evident in the vicinity of predicted A-bulges in stems 2 and 3. In vitro and in vivo frameshifting assays showed that the SARS-CoV frameshift signal is functionally similar to other viral frameshift signals: it promotes efficient frameshifting in all of the standard assay systems, and it is sensitive to a drug and a genetic mutation that are known to affect frameshifting efficiency of a yeast virus. Mutagenesis studies reveal that both the specific sequences and structures of stems 2 and 3 are important for efficient frameshifting. We have identified a new RNA structural motif that is capable of promoting efficient programmed ribosomal frameshifting. The high degree of conservation of three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot structures among the coronaviruses suggests that this presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics.","output":"A Three-Stemmed mRNA Pseudoknot in the SARS Coronavirus Frameshift Signal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parents of children with intellectual disability (ID) suffer from comparatively emotional insecurity compared to parents of children without ID, especially during periods of crisis, such as the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.

We describe hypertension knowledge and beliefs, treatment patterns, and reported reasons for treatment non-use among adults with diagnosed hypertension in Chennai, India. METHODS: We collected data on 833 adults ages 30+ with physician diagnosed hypertension using a door-to-door household survey within randomly selected wards of Chennai. We described the proportion of individuals who were not taking daily medications and their reported reasons for not doing so. Next, we described individuals knowledge of hypertension consequences and how to control blood pressure (BP) and assessed the association between knowledge and daily treatment use. RESULTS: Over one quarter (28% (95% CI 25% to 31%)) of diagnosed individuals reported not taking daily treatment. The largest proportion (18% (95% CI 16% to 21%)) were individuals who had discontinued prior treatment use. The primary reason individuals reported for non-daily use was that their BP had returned to normal. Just 23% (95% CI 20% to 26%) of individuals listed BP medications as the most effective way to reduce BP; however, these individuals were 11% points (95% CI 4% to 19%) more likely to take daily medications. Conversely, 43% (95% CI 40% to 47%) of individuals believed that BP medications should be stopped from time to time and these individuals were 15% points (95% CI ?0.21 to C0.09) less likely to take daily treatment. While awareness of the consequences of hypertension was poor, we found no evidence that it was associated with taking daily medications. CONCLUSIONS: There were large gaps in consistency of BP medication use which were strongly associated with knowledge about BP medications. Further research is needed to identify whether addressing beliefs can improve daily treatment use among individuals with diagnosed hypertension.","output":"Hypertension knowledge and treatment initiation, adherence, and discontinuation among adults in Chennai, India: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-B reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone.

Lockdowns may have exacerbated existing mental health concerns among tertiary students, who experience higher levels of mental health concerns compared to the wider community. This study aimed to investigate the association between modifiable lifestyle factors and wellbeing of students at a Melbourne-based tertiary education institution during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: This quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted across campuses in Melbourne and Sydney. Data was collected via online questionnaire during the 7th week of a second-wave lockdown. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic variables (n = 239). Linear regression models were estimated to determine multivariate associations between lifestyle variables and psychological distress. RESULTS: Participants were on average 30.98 years old (SD = 9.78), predominantly female, domestic students, undergraduate, not the first member of their family to attend university and living out of family home. Mindfulness, diet quality, sleep quality and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were all inversely correlated with psychological distress. Unadjusted and adjusted models show that mindfulness, sleep quality, and MVPA were all independently inversely related to psychological distress. Greater mindfulness, sleep quality and engagement in MVPA were associated with lower psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdowns. LIMITATIONS: As this study is cross-sectional and we cannot rule out reverse causality. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential for lifestyle focused mental-health promotion delivered through tertiary education institutions to support students in times of crisis as well as more generally.","output":"Lifestyle behaviours and mental health and wellbeing of tertiary students during COVID-19 lockdown in Australia: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to compare the welfare of dairy cows kept in two traditional husbandry systems (semi-intensive and intensive farming) in south-eastern Sicily.

Methods In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 5 infants, who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology in Wuhan Children's hospital from 31 th January to 25 th February 2020, were collected. Bedside pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, and the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. Results Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation. The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case. The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the sametime.

Very few alternatives to amputation are available, mainly the resection of a part or the totality of the calcaneal bone. Calcanectomies were advanced as limb-sparing procedures in patients with heel osteomyelitis. However, there is a lack of pooled quantitative evidence on their efficacy and complications. OBJECTIVES The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the primary outcome of healing rates following partial (PC) and total calcanectomies (TC) in treating calcaneal osteomyelitis due to diabetic heel ulcers. Additionally, secondary outcomes such as secondary TC following PC, secondary below knee amputation (BKA), mortality and the change in the ambulation status were analyzed. METHODS Medline, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched since inception. All types of study design were included. Single case report studies and studies reporting osteomyelitis due to other etiologies than DFU were excluded. RESULTS Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria comprising 295 patients with 300 calcanectomies (270 PC and 30 TC). With a mean follow-up period of 29.317.7 months, the weighted results were as follows: a) the osteomyelitis healing rate was of 80% (95% CI=0.728 to 0.861, I2=48.3%), b) the rate of secondary total calcanectomy was of 5.4% (95% CI=0.022 to 0.097, I2=7.5%), c) the rate of secondary BKA was of 17.1% (95% CI=0.111 to 0.241, I2=50.6%) with no difference between subgroups of TC and PC, and d) the combined mortality rate of both calcanectomies was of 13.4% (95% CI=0.064 to 0.224, I2=73.6%); however, significant higher mortality was found following TC compared to PC (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Partial and total calcanectomies were found to yield very good healing rates with acceptable complication frequencies. When compared to the reported outcomes of below and above-knee amputations in the literature, calcanectomies could be fairly considered as good alternatives to above ankle amputations.","output":"Outcomes of partial and total calcanectomies for the treatment of diabetic heel ulcers complicated with osteomyelitis.

Particularly, we wonder if these shortcomings could (partly) be the consequence of the inability of neural IR models to perform lexical matching off-the-shelf. In this work, we propose a measure of discrepancy between the lexical matching performed by any (neural) model and an 'ideal' one. Based on this, we study the behavior of different state-of-the-art neural IR models, focusing on whether they are able to perform lexical matching when it's actually useful, i.e. for important terms.

METHODS Fifteen semiprofessional players completed a 90-min simulated soccer match. Before, immediately after, and at 24, 48, and 72 h, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Perceived fatigue and muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation during isometric knee extensor contractions and at rest were measured to assess central (voluntary activation) and peripheral (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) fatigue, and responses to single and paired magnetic stimuli were assessed to quantify corticospinal excitability and short intracortical inhibition, respectively. Countermovement jump, reactive strength index, and sprint performance were assessed to profile the recovery of physical function. RESULTS Simulated match play elicited decrements in MVC that remained unresolved at 72 h (P = 0.01). Central fatigue was prominent immediately postexercise (-9% reduction in voluntary activation) and remained depressed at 48 h (-2%, P = 0.03). Qtw,pot declined by 14% postexercise, remained similarly depressed at 24 h, and had not fully recovered 72 h after (-5%, P = 0.01). Corticospinal excitability was reduced at 24 h (P = 0.047) only, and no change in short intracortical inhibition was observed. Measures of jump performance and self-reported fatigue followed a similar time course recovery to neuromuscular fatigue. CONCLUSION Central processes contribute significantly to the neuromuscular fatigue experienced in the days after soccer match play, but the magnitude and slower recovery of peripheral fatigue indicates that it is the resolution of muscle function that primarily explains the recovery of neuromuscular fatigue after soccer match play.","output":"Etiology and Recovery of Neuromuscular Fatigue after Simulated Soccer Match Play."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been proposed that teachers, like healthcare workers, constitute a strategic target for COVID-19 vaccine programs as immunization is a key element in protecting both them and their pupils.

Associations between vaccine uptake among teachers and their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination were assessed through multivariate logistic regression. 6152 participants completed both baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 4502 (73.2%) reported their intention at baseline to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, if available; at follow-up, 3894 (86.5%) of the same 4502 reported having received the vaccination. A significant association was revealed between vaccine uptake and perceived severity, self-efficacy, and social norms. The principal driver for vaccine acceptance was the wish to avoid contracting the disease. Conversely, the principal driver for vaccine refusal was concern about side effects and safety. A strong association exists between intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and actual uptake.

Respiratory tract infection is a common cause of asthma exacerbations. There has not been evidence suggesting the link between COVID-19 and asthma exacerbation, especially in places with dramatic responses in infection control with universal masking and aggressive social distancing. Objectives: To assess the number for admissions of asthma exacerbations in January to April 2020 in Hong Kong with reference to admission in the past 5 years. Methods: Admission records of asthma exacerbations were retrieved from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Patients aged 18 years or older with a known history of asthma admitted for asthma exacerbation were included. Log-linear was used to model count, with year and masking used as covariate and further analysis on ambient temperature and length of hospital stays. Fishers exact test was used to compare the mortality rate and mechanical ventilation between the periods. Admissions for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and gastric ulcer were included as controls. Results: The number of admissions for asthma exacerbations significantly decreased by 53.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.4C55.8%) in 2020 compared with monthly average admission in 2015C2019, with a higher magnitude of decrease compared with control diagnoses.

Conclusions: Hospitalization number for asthma exacerbations significantly decreased in early 2020, with similar length of stay. This was observed with concomitant practice of universal masking and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong.

In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and &#967;2 tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05).

The gain in binding affinity for the N501Y RBD mutant to the ACE2 is attributed to improved - stacking and -cation interactions. The enhanced receptor affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of a specific hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interaction with Glu75 of ACE2. Notably, both the mutations reduce the binding affinity for B38 due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions.

Both AO and MI have shown promising effects in people with PD, but previous studies have only used these separately. OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development and pilot testing of an intervention combining AO + MI and physical practice to improve functional manual actions in people with PD. METHODS: The home-based intervention, delivered using a tablet computer app, was iteratively designed by an interdisciplinary team, including people with PD, and further developed through focus groups and initial field testing. Preliminary data on feasibility were obtained via a six-week pilot randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 11184024) of 10 participants with mild to moderate PD (6 intervention; 4 treatment as usual). Usage and adherence data were recorded during training, and semistructured interviews were conducted with participants. Exploratory outcome measures included dexterity and timed action performance. RESULTS: Usage and qualitative data provided preliminary evidence of acceptability and usability. Exploratory outcomes also suggested that subjective and objective performance of manual actions should be tested in a larger trial. The importance of personalisation, choice, and motivation was highlighted, as well as the need to facilitate engagement in motor imagery.

However, the nationwide lockdown and the sealing of inter-state and international borders to control the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the reverse migration of informal migrant workers. This requires the central and state governments to collectively forge strategies to enable their reverse migration and smooth reintegration in the post-COVID economy. In this paper, we have focused on the inter-state migrants in India and returnee migrants only from Gulf countries as they account for two-thirds of Indian migrants living abroad. This study conducted a comparative analysis of the Indian governments varied approach towards its internal and international migrants during their reverse migration, repatriation and reintegration after the announcement of the lockdown. Firstly, the paper compares the challenges faced by internal and international migrant workers during these stages with the help of in-depth interview data collected from migrants and social workers. Secondly, the varied governmental responses towards their repatriation are discussed.

Physiological recordings from dlPFC Delay cells have shown that the generation of mental representations during working memory relies on NMDAR neurotransmission, with surprisingly little contribution from AMPAR. Systemic administration of low antidepressant doses of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, erodes these representations and reduces dlPFC Delay cell firing. In contrast to the dlPFC, V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depends on AMPAR, with much less contribution from NMDAR. Similarly, neurons in the dlPFC that respond to sensory events (cue cells, response feedback cells) rely on AMPAR, and systemic ketamine increases their firing. Insults to NMDAR transmission, and the impaired ability for dlPFC to generate mental representations, may contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., from genetic insults that weaken NMDAR transmission, or from blockade of NMDAR by kynurenic acid. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in dlPFC may also contribute to cognitive deficits in other disorders with pronounced neuroinflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), or peripheral infections where kynurenine can enter brain (e.g., delirium from sepsis, brain fog in COVID19). Much less is known about NMDAR actions in the primate cingulate cortices. However, NMDAR neurotransmission appears to process the affective and visceral responses to pain and other aversive experiences mediated by the cingulate cortices, which may contribute to sustained alterations in mood state. We hypothesize that the very rapid, antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine may involve the disruption of NMDAR-generated aversive mood states by the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices, providing a foot in the door to allow the subsequent return of top-down regulation by higher PFC areas. Thus, the detrimental vs. therapeutic effects of NMDAR blockade may be circuit dependent.","output":"NMDAR Neurotransmission Needed for Persistent Neuronal Firing: Potential Roles in Mental Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden increase of the COVID-19 outbreak and its continued growth with mutations in various forms has created a global health crisis as well as devastating social and economic effects over the past two years.

The platform was tested on 120 SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from real clinical samples (60 positive and 60 negative confirmed by conventional RT-PCR method). Based on obtained quantitative results and statistical analysis (box-diagram, cutoff value, receiver operating characteristic curve, and t-test), the biosensor revealed a significant difference between the two positive and negative groups with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. To evaluate the quantitation capacity and detection limit of the biosensor for clinical trials, the detection performance of the biosensor for continuously diluted RNA isolated from SARS-CoV-2-confirmed patients was compared to those obtained by RT-PCR, demonstrating that the detection limit of the biosensor is lower than or comparable to that of RT-PCR. The ssDNA/BNQDs/FGNs/SPCE showed negligible cross-reactivity with RNA fragments isolated from Influenza A (IAV) clinical samples and also remained stable for up to 14 days.

Where restarting research activities is permitted, investigators need to evaluate the risks and benefits of resuming data collection and adapt procedures to minimize risk. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the multicountry Household Air Pollution Intervention (HAPIN) trial conducted in rural, low-resource settings, we developed a framework to assess the risk of each trial activity and to guide protective measures. Our goal is to maximize the integrity of reseach aims while minimizing infection risk based on the latest scientific understanding of the virus. METHODS: We drew on a combination of expert consultations, risk assessment frameworks, institutional guidance and literature to develop our framework. We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. National and local government recommendations provided the minimum safety guidelines for our work. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential viral aerosolization while performing the activity. For each activity, one of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities that can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a systematic, procedure-specific approach to risk assessment for each trial activity, we were able to protect our participants and research team and to uphold our ability to deliver on the research commitments we have made to our staff, participants, local communities, and funders. This framework can be tailored to other research studies conducted in similar settings during the current pandemic, as well as potential future outbreaks with similar transmission dynamics.

Disease-induced fatigue may function to reduce physical activity during acute infection, thereby making more energy available to mount an effective immune response. However, fatigue in the context of chronic disease may be maladaptive because long-term reductions in physical activity increase risks of disease progression and the acquisition of additional morbidities. Here, we test whether cumulative chronic morbidity is associated with subjective fatigue. METHODOLOGY: We constructed a cumulative chronic morbidity score using self-reported diagnoses and algorithm-based assessments, and a subjective fatigue score based on four questionnaire items using cross-sectional survey data from the Study on global AGEing and adult health, which features large samples of adults from six countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa). RESULTS: In a mixed-effects linear model with participants nested in countries (N = 32 455), greater cumulative chronic morbidity is associated with greater subjective fatigue ( = 0.34, SE = 0.005, P < 2e?16). This association replicates within each country and is robust to adjustment for key sociodemographic and physical covariates (sex, age, household wealth, physical function score, habitual physical activity, BMI and BMI(2)). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Fatigue is a common but perhaps maladaptive neuropsychological response to chronic morbidity. Disease-induced fatigue may mediate a self-perpetuating cycle, in which chronic morbidity reduces physical activity, and less physical activity increases cumulative chronic morbidity. Longitudinal research is needed to test whether chronic morbidity, fatigue and physical activity form a cyclical feedback loop. Lay Summary: Fatigue during acute illness may promote recovery, but persistent fatigue in the context of chronic disease may make matters worse. We present evidence from six countries that more chronic disease is associated with more fatigue. This fatigue may reduce physical activity, which increases risks of acquiring additional chronic health problems.","output":"Greater chronic morbidity is associated with greater fatigue in six countries: A case of evolutionary mismatch?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background There is accumulating evidence that human rhinovirus (HRV) causes acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI). Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is not well understood. Objectives We investigated the molecular epidemiology, demographic and clinical characteristics of HRVs among hospitalized children with ALRIs. Study design One hundred and sixty-five nasopharangeal aspirates taken from children <5 years hospitalized with ALRTIs in Serdang Hospital, Malaysia, were subject to reverse transcriptase-PCR for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis on VP4/VP2 and 5-NCR regions was used to further characterize HRV. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated using semi-nested multiplex RT-PCR assay. Clinical parameters were analyzed between HRV, RSV and IFV-A mono-infections and between HRV species. Results HRV was detected in 54 (33%) patients for both single (36 samples) and multiple (18 samples) infections, 61.1% (22/36) represents HRV-A strains while the remaining 14 HRV-C. Strain P51was the first reported representative of HRV98. The majority of the single HRV cases were in the second half of infancy; HRV-C occurred among older children compared with HRV-A. HRV children were admitted significantly earlier and less febrile than RSV and IFV-A infection. HRV-C infected children were more likely to have rhonchi and vomiting as compared to HRV-A. Pneumonia was the most common discharge diagnosis followed by bronchiolitis and post-viral wheeze in HRV patients. Conclusion Our study showed high prevalence of HRVs and detection of HRV-C among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia.

This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5-triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, -subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5-cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.","output":"PERK Signal-Modulated Protein Translation Promotes the Survivability of Dengue 2 Virus-Infected Mosquito Cells and Extends Viral Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With time, the Nipah virus has been proved as a fatal and dangerous pathogen for humanity.

All students completed ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and perceived stress scale (PSS) questionnaires and answered other questions designed to ascertain information on the risk factors related to DED. DED was diagnosed when OSDI scores were greater than or equal to 13. The prevalence of symptomatic DED was determined. A T-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the possible risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of symptomatic DED among Chinese high school students was 70.5%. In univariate analysis, higher PSS scores (P<0.001), prolonged video display terminal (VDT) use (P<0.001), wearing contact lenses (P=0.001), poor sleep quality (P<0.001), and being female (P<0.001) were significantly correlated with dry eyes.

Older age (=0.09; P=.01), postgraduate education (=0.11; P=.01), and current use of self-management apps related to BD (=0.13; P<.001) were associated with higher eHEALS ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of self-reported digital health literacy were comparable or higher than other studies in the general population and specific physical/mental health conditions. However, individuals with BD who are younger, have completed less education, or are less familiar with mental health apps may require extra support to safely and productively navigate web-based health resources. Relevant educational initiatives are discussed. Future studies should evaluate skill development interventions for less digitally literate groups.","output":"Digital Health Literacy in Bipolar Disorder: International Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, Australias older population (aged 65 and over) has been growing rapidly, accompanied by a shift in its country of birth composition Although a great deal of research has been undertaken on past and current aspects of Australias migrant groups, little attention has been paid to future demographic trends in older populations The aim of this paper is to examine recent and possible future demographic trends of Australias migrant populations at the older ages We present population estimates by country and broad global region of birth from 1996 to 2016, and then new birthplace-specific population projections for the 2016 to 2056 period Our findings show that substantial growth of the 65+ population will occur in the coming decades, and that the overseas-born will shift from a Europe-born dominance to an Asia-born dominance Cohort flow (the effect of varying sizes of cohorts moving into the 65+ age group over time) will be the main driver of growth for most older birthplace populations The shifting demography of Australias older population signals many policy, planning, service delivery and funding challenges for government and private sector providers We discuss those related to aged care, health care, language services, the aged care workforce, regulatory frameworks and future research needs in demography and gerontology","output":"Past and projected growth of Australias older migrant populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To compare the difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and figure out the potential symptoms lead to severity.

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..","output":"Psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among frontline doctors of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged, various clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting the clinical features of COVID-19. Two investigators independently searched PubMed (December 2019CFebruary 2020) for eligible articles. A meta-analysis was performed to measure the frequencies of clinical outcomes and symptoms of COVID-19. A stratified analysis was conducted according to the timeline of outbreak and exposure histories: Group I, most patients were exposed to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and lived in Wuhan, Hubei province; Group II, patients lived in Hubei province but were not directly exposed to the market; and Group III, patients lived outside Hubei. RESULTS: Thirteen studies, all from China, were eligible. The estimated mortality rate among all studies was 2.12%, but that in Group I was 8.66%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in Group I was 20.00%. Both fever and cough were major symptoms, and their frequencies were higher in Group I than in Groups II and III, while the frequency of diarrhea in Group I was lower than that in Group III. The estimated frequency of dyspnea in Group I was 37.18%, while those in Groups II and III were 16.95% and 7.03%, respectively.

This situation is exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic triggered by the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RNA viruses are older than DNA viruses. Indeed, from an evolutionary standpoint, RNA is an older molecule than DNA. The strength of RNA viruses, compared to DNA viruses, resides in their simplicity and instability. The instability of RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and flu viruses, generates mutants to escape the host's defense mechanisms. A formidable combination of lethality and infectivity was recently achieved by SARS-CoV-2. Complex DNAbased defense systems use Toll-like receptors to intercept viral RNA inside a cell. Activation of Toll-like receptors triggers inflammation and activates lymphocytes and monocytes, causing thromboxane release. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, this process results in cytokine storms and lung thromboembolism. The ongoing pandemic can be envisioned as a struggle between highly evolved complex DNA organisms, i.e., humans, and poorly evolved simple RNA organisms, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 virus. Quite surprisingly, the complex organism has a serious problem defeating the simplistic organism. However, humans are finally developing a new effective weapon in fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, paradoxically, RNA-based vaccines.

NSP2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the - phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its - phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP2 hydrolyzes the P from RNAs and NTPs through Mg(2+)-dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His(225) residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RTPase activity of NSP2 may account for the absence of 5-terminal P on the (?) strands of the dsRNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during P hydrolysis.","output":"Histidine Triad-Like Motif of the Rotavirus NSP2 Octamer Mediates Both RTPase and NTPase Activities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper develops an algorithm to predict the number of Covid-19 patients who will start to use ventilators tomorrow.

On CT imaging, early stage patients (n = 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by interlobular septal thickening. Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the progression stage based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in multiple lung segments and lobes (21/3461.8%), and an uneven increase in ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like shadows(30.5%). Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT. These showed diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with a white lung presentation, and mild pleural effusion. Six patients in remission (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions. Based on clinical signs, 71 (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage patients. The length of hospitalisation was 7C28 days (mean: 10  3.5 days). On discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some patients. One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died. The overall mortality rate was 1.05%. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is important for early lesion detection, determining the nature of lesions, and assessing disease severity.","output":"Preliminary CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable development is considered as one of the vital challenges of the 21st century for humanity The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has disrupted economic and social life, forcing governments and businesses to reconsider their priorities There are rare empirical studies on the national innovation system and its relationship to sustainability development for emerging countries This paper aims at shedding light on how mission\\\\oriented policies have marked sustainable regional development and innovation in Latin America The present study presents the capabilities that could support the improvement of the national innovation system and, as a consequence, sustainability development To understand how Latin American countries act on innovation and sustainable development initiatives, two global rankings in these areas, The Global Innovation Index 2020 and The Sustainable Development Report 2020, were analyzed The results indicate some obstacles must be overcome such as the high levels of social inequality and poverty that still constitute significant challenges for this region Todays biggest challenges are facing a pandemic situation and guaranteeing economic development that allows the underprivileged to escape poverty without dooming future generations to an even more degraded environment than the current one Innovation continues to play a critical role in the transition toward a more sustainable world ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Challenges for innovation and sustainable development in Latin America: The significance of institutions and human capital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the COVID-19 pandemic still accounts for thousands of cases every day.

The Central European country of Slovakia reached one of the highest daily mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants in the first 3 months of 2021, despite implementing strong prophylactic measures, lockdowns and repeated nationwide antigen testing. The present study reports a comparison of the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test (SD Biosensor) with three commercial RT-qPCR kits (vDetect COVID-19-MultiplexDX, gb SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex-GENERI BIOTECH Ltd. and Genvinset COVID-19 [E]-BDR Diagnostics) in the detection of infected individuals among employees of the Martin University Hospital in Slovakia. Health care providers, such as doctors and nurses, are classified as critical infrastructure, and there is no doubt about the huge impact that incorrect results could have on patients. Out of 1231 samples, 14 were evaluated as positive for SARS-CoV-2 antigen presence, and all of them were confirmed by RT-qPCR kit 1 and kit 2. As another 26 samples had a signal in the E gene, these 40 samples were re-isolated and subsequently re-analysed using the three kits, which detected the virus in 22, 23 and 12 cases, respectively. The results point to a divergence not only between antigen and RT-qPCR tests, but also within the gold standard RT-qPCR testing. Performance analysis of the diagnostic antigen test showed the positive predictive value (PPV) to be 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) to be 98.10%, indicating that 1.90% of individuals with a negative result were, in fact, positive. If these data are extrapolated to the national level, where the mean daily number of antigen tests was 250,000 in April 2021, it points to over 4700 people per day being misinterpreted and posing a risk of virus shedding. While mean Ct values of the samples that were both antigen and RT-qPCR positive were about 20 (kit 1: 20.47 and 20.16 for Sarbeco E and RdRP, kit 2: 19.37 and 19.99 for Sarbeco E and RdRP and kit 3: 17.47 for ORF1b/RdRP), mean Ct values of the samples that were antigen-negative but RT-qPCR-positive were about 30 (kit 1: 30.67 and 30.00 for Sarbeco E and RdRP, kit 2: 29.86 and 31.01 for Sarbeco E and RdRP and kit 3: 27.47 for ORF1b/RdRP). It confirms the advantage of antigen test in detecting the most infectious individuals with a higher viral load. However, the reporting of Ct values is still a matter of ongoing debates and should not be conducted without normalisation to standardised controls of known concentration.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Detection by Rapid Antigen and by Three Commercial RT-qPCR Tests: A Study from Martin University Hospital in Slovakia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic imaging is regarded as fundamental in the clinical work-up of patients with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Health facility leaders were at the forefront of maintaining service delivery and were exposed to varied stressors in the early phase of the pandemic. This study aims to explore the leadership experiences of health facility leaders during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria's epicentre. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study conducted an exploratory descriptive qualitative study. To achieve this, 33 health facility leaders of different cadres across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the public health care system in Lagos, Nigeria, were remotely interviewed. The key informant interviews were transcribed verbatim and were analysed by using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: The health facility leaders experienced heightened levels of fear, anxiety and stressors during the early phase of the pandemic. They also had genuine concerns about exposing their family members to the virus and had to manage some health-care workers who were afraid for their lives and reluctant. Coping mechanisms included psychological and social support, innovative hygiene measures at health facility and at home, training and staff welfare in more ways than usual. They were motivated to continue rendering services during the crisis because of their passion, their calling, the Hippocratic oath and support from the State government. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The experiences of health facility leaders from different parts of the world have been documented. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies that specifically report multi-layer leadership experiences of health facility leaders during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa.","output":"Leading in a time of crisis: exploring early experiences of health facility leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria's epicentre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Bovine astrovirus serotype 2 (US2) was adapted to primary neonatal kidney cell (NBK) cultures by the addition of 50 g ml?1 of trypsin in the medium. Infectious virus was released from the cells within 7 days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infections exceeded one. Occasionally 10C20% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3 9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.","output":"Cultivation and partial characterization of bovine astrovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10-13 days. Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days. The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.

The survey included socio-demographic and health-related questions, questions related to HBM and TPB dimensions, and intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Associations between questionnaire variables and COVID-19 vaccination intention were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eighty percent of 398 eligible respondents stated their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

To enhance knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, considerable online resources have been made available, including aspects related to the dental profession. The study aim was to examine the knowledge, perception, and attitude of dental professionals in Indonesia toward COVID-19. We conducted a survey via a questionnaire created using Google docs and distributed to 632 members of the Indonesian Dental Association in the context of a webinar hosted by the Indonesian Oral Biology Association on first June, 2020. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire consisted of 17 items pertaining to demographic data, knowledge and virus identification, awareness regarding drugs commonly used in dentistry during pandemic and research opportunities. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire after the webinar by choosing one answer to each question. For the analysis, participants were divided into three groups according to their professional background i.e., employment at national hospital, private hospital, or academic faculty. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and expressed as frequencies and percentages. The chi-square test was used to investigate the association between professional activity and the level of knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes about COVID-19. Results: Sixty percent of the participants correctly identified the pathogenesis of the disease. This knowledge was not associated with their professional affiliation (p = 0.95). Sixty-seven percentage had comprehensive knowledge about virus detection methods. This knowledge was not associated with their affiliation either (p = 0.54). Questions regarding drugs of choice, prevention, and the spread of COVID-19 were correctly answered by 89, 96, and 82% of the participants, respectively. Knowledge of these aspects were significantly associated with the professional affiliation (p < 0.05). All respondents were optimistic regarding research opportunities (p < 0.01). Respondents from academics were more interested in joining COVID-19-related research projects with governmental institutions (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian dentists are reasonably good. However, further improvement would be beneficial to manage patients during this pandemic.

Method: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we research MEDLINE for original studies published from January 1st, 2020, to January 31st, 2021, that reported proportions of PACS manifestations. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included patients aged []18 years with confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR or antigen testing and a minimum follow-up of 21 days. The prevalence of individual manifestations across studies was pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. For evaluating determinants of heterogeneity, meta-regression analysis was performed.

AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire.

Two competing hypotheses were tested: (a) people felt increasingly older due to the stress generated by the pandemic; (b) people felt increasingly younger due to psychological distancing from older age, a vulnerability to COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An age and sex stratified sample of adults from across the United States (baseline N = 3,738) was assessed on three occasions: before the COVID-19 outbreak in late-January/early-February and during the outbreak in late-March and again in late-April. Multilevel modeling analysis examined change in subjective age and tested potential moderators of individual differences in the trajectory of subjective age. RESULTS: The average trajectory of subjective age followed a concave curve, with a nadir (feeling younger) during the second assessment in late-March. Older age, negative expectations about aging, absence of pre-existing conditions, and less stress during COVID-19 were associated with feeling younger but did not predict the rate of change. The only significant predictor of change in subjective age was the belief that the coronavirus is only a threat to older adults: The more individuals agreed with this statement, the more likely it was that they felt increasingly younger at follow-up. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Subjective age changed during a global health crisis, with people feeling younger with the emergence COVID-19.

A common approach in the literature is to solve an approximate model, and to use a simulation to evaluate the true objective value of one or more solutions. We propose a new approach -- Branch-and-Simulate -- for integrating simulation into the optimization model itself. Branch-and-Simulate is a variant of logic-based Benders decomposition where we run a simulation at each incumbent solution to the master problem. The simulation data is then used to guide the trajectory of the optimization model itself, via Benders cuts. We test the approach on a class of stochastic resource allocation problems with monotonic performance measures, and derive strong Benders cuts which are valid for all problems of this form. We consider two concrete examples: an airport check-in counter allocation problem, and a nursing home shift scheduling problem. Whereas previously these problems could only be solved approximately, we solve challenging instances to optimality within a reasonable amount of time.

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in propolis products worldwide; fortunately, various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism are potential targets for propolis compounds. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2. This mechanism involves PAK1 overexpression, which is a kinase that mediates coronavirus-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and immune system suppression. Propolis components have inhibitory effects on the ACE2, TMPRSS2 and PAK1 signaling pathways; in addition, antiviral activity has been proven in vitro and in vivo. In pre-clinical studies, propolis promoted immunoregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including reduction in IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF-&#945;. This immunoregulation involves monocytes and macrophages, as well as Jak2/STAT3, NF-kB, and inflammasome pathways, reducing the risk of cytokine storm syndrome, a major mortality factor in advanced COVID-19 disease. Propolis has also shown promise as an aid in the treatment of various of the comorbidities that are particularly dangerous in COVID-19 patients, including respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.

VLPs are robust protein scaffolds exhibiting well-defined geometry and uniformity that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome. They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety. VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities. In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens.

E-health security risks have also risen significantly with the rise in the use of telehealth. This paper addresses one of e-health's key concerns, namely security. Secret sharing is a cryptographic method to ensure reliable and secure access to information. To eliminate the constraint that in the existing secret sharing schemes, this paper presents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) guided patients' privileged based secure sharing. This is a new secret sharing technique that generates the shares using a simple mask based operation. This work considers addressing the challenges presents in the original secret sharing scheme. This proposed technique enhances the security of the existing scheme. This research introduces a concept of privileged share in which among k number of shares one share should come from a specific recipient (patient) to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the original information. In the absence of this privileged share, the original information cannot be reconstructed. This technique also offers TPM based exchange of secret shares to prevent Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM). Here, two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key for transmitting the secret shares. The proposed method has been found to produce attractive results that show that the scheme achieves a great degree of protection, reliability, and efficiency and also comparable to the existing secret sharing scheme.","output":"Tree parity machine guided patients' privileged based secure sharing of electronic medical record: cybersecurity for telehealth during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health and fitness wearables present viable solutions for public wellbeing by providing remote personal control and clinical intervention through telemedicine networks Due to their noninvasive and continuous vital sign monitoring, optoelectronic wearables are incorporated in number of studies to identify the onset and progression of the Coronavirus pandemic, and institutions deployed patient surveillance networks based on them Today's optoelectronic wearables rely on rigid light emitting and sensing technologies that are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to discontinuous skin contact However, wearable-based digital health systems require the extraction of clinical grade data for the actionable outcomes Therefore, optoelectronic technologies that provide clinical grade data through seamless skin integration are in high demand The seamlessly integrable optoelectronic technologies for wearable based digital health solutions are discussed here The review of highlighted wearable optoelectronic materials and technologies provides a benchmark, therefore helps to define pathways through the realization of clinical grade wearables rising as strong contenders for the public health strategies ? 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","output":"Seamlessly Integrable Optoelectronics for Clinical Grade Wearables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Surabaya Port Health Office (PHO) Class I is tasked with the disease prevention by detection, response and protection at entrance gates for the sea and airports and over the state cross-border posts regarding the situation of COVID-19 pandemic This analysis aimed to assess activities of early warning alert and response system to COVID-19 at Juanda International Airport on January 2020 The method used includes interviewing four informants, studying of documents and directing field-observation by following activities of PHO, who supervise, inspect General Declarations, distribute, and collect the Health Alert Card (HAC) and monitor body temperature of travelers The analysis uses a system approach and 4M model with modification by adding time, technology and information variables Activities in the early warning alert and response system of COVID-19 are in accordance with the Preparedness Guidelines by the Indonesian Goverment The outputs of reported activities have been classified as appropriate The HAC form is lacking as a source of COVID-19 surveillance, address information part is often being misinterpreted by travelers It is necessary to add additional questions regarding the destination address of travelers, and to educate on how to fill HAC correctly so that the effectiveness of HAC can be maximized","output":"Analysis of Epidemiological Surveillance Activity of the COVID-19 at Surabaya Airport Indonesia on January 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many years, technology has been applied to improve the quality of language learning and teaching.

The realtime accurate and predictive model of the number of infected cases could help inform the government of providing medical assistance and public health decision-making. This work is to model the ongoing COVID-19 spread in Thailand during the 1st and 2nd phases of the pandemic using the simple but powerful method based on the model-free and time series regression models. By employing the curve fitting, the model-free method using the logistic function, hyperbolic tangent function, and Gaussian function was applied to predict the number of newly infected patients and accumulate the total number of cases, including peak and viral cessation (ending) date. Alternatively, with a significant time-lag of historical data input, the regression model predicts those parameters from 1-day-ahead to 1-month-ahead. To obtain optimal prediction models, the parameters of the model-free method are fine-tuned through the genetic algorithm, whereas the generalized least squares update the parameters of the regression model. Assuming the future trend continues to follow the past pattern, the expected total number of patients is approximately 2,689 - 3,000 cases. The estimated viral cessation dates are May 2, 2020 (using Gaussian function), May 4, 2020 (using a hyperbolic function), and June 5, 2020 (using a logistic function), whereas the peak time occurred on April 5, 2020. Moreover, the model-free method performs well for long-term prediction, whereas the regression model is suitable for short-term prediction. Furthermore, the performances of the regression models yield a highly accurate forecast with lower RMSE and higher R2 up to 1-week-ahead.

Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the value of the VHIT test against the background of other diagnostic tests, including videonystagmographic (VNG) examination, Dix-Hallpike maneuver, VHIT test, posturographic examination, which are possible to perform in a patient with dizziness. Material and methods: The study was performed in 200 patients aged 18-78 years, who were divided into two groups: I study - 100 patients with mixed dizziness, aged 18-78 years, II (reference group) - 100 healthy patients (students of the Faculty of Mili-tary and Medical University of Lodz and patients of the Clinic, without anamnesis of body imbalances (preventive examination), aged 20-60 years. After performing an otorynolaryngological subjective and physical examination, each patient was subjected to a caloric test according to Fitzgerald-Hallpike in the VNG test using a water calorimeter. Then the Dix-Hallpike maneuver was performed, while the activity of semicircular canals in the VHIT test was determined on the basis of the GAIN value. In randomly selected patients, posturographic examinations were additionally carried out. Results: Based on the positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver, damage in the posterior semicircular canal in group I was found in 9 women (9.0%) and 4 men (4.0%), while a negative maneuver was noted in all people in group II. In group I in the VHIT study, damage to the semicircular canals most often concerned the following parts: anterior in 29 women (44.60%) and in 15 men (42.85%); posterior, in 19 (29.23%) and 8 (22.85%), respectively; lateral, in 3 (4.61%) and 3 (8.57%), respectively.

In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images. The results obtained on diverse datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed work. A pre-processing technique has also been proposed for radiological data. The study further compares pre-trained CNN architectures and classification models against the proposed technique.","output":"Transfer learning-based ensemble support vector machine model for automated COVID-19 detection using lung computerized tomography scan data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are very sensitive and specific methods, but they mainly rely on centralized laboratories and therefore are not suitable for point-of-care testing. Here, we present a 3D microfluidic paper-based electrochemical NAAT. These devices use off-the-shelf gold plasma-coated threads to integrate electroanalytical readouts using ex situ self-assembled monolayer formation on the threads prior to assembling into the paper device. They further include a sandwich hybridization assay with sample incubation, rinsing, and detection steps all integrated using movable stacks of filter papers to allow time-sequenced reactions. The devices use glass fiber substrates for storing recombinase polymerase amplification reagents and conducting the isothermal amplification. We used the paper-based device for the detection of the toxic microalgae Ostreopsis cf. ovata. The NAAT, completed in 95 min, attained a limit of detection of 0.06 pM target synthetic DNA and was able to detect 1 ng/L O. cf. ovata genomic DNA with negligible cross-reactivity from a closely related microalgae species. We think that the integration of thread electrodes within paper-based devices paves the way for digital one-time use NAATs and numerous other advanced electroanalytical paper- or textile-based devices.","output":"Electroanalytical Paper-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Biosensors with Integrated Thread Electrodes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019 a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged, causing a global pandemic within only a few weeks. A crucial factor in the public health response to pandemics is achieving a short turnaround time between a potential case becoming known, specimen collection and availability of a test result. In this article we address a logistics problem that arises in the context of testing potential cases. We assume that specimens can be collected in two ways: either by means of a mobile test-team or by means of a stationary test-team in a test-centre. After the specimens have been collected they must be delivered to a laboratory in order to be analysed. The problem we address aims at deciding how many test-centres to open and where, how many mobile test-teams to use, which suspected cases to assign to a test-centre and which to visit with a mobile test-team, which specimen to assign to which laboratory, and planning the routes of the mobile test-teams. The objective is to minimise the total cost of opening test-centres and routing mobile test-teams. We introduce this new problem, which we call the contagious disease testing problem (CDTP), and present a mixed-integer linear-programming formulation for it. We propose a large neighbourhood search metaheuristic for solving the CDTP and present an extensive computational study to illustrate its performance. Furthermore, we give managerial insights regarding COVID-19 test logistics, derived from problem instances based on real world data.","output":"A Large Neighbourhood Search Metaheuristic for the Contagious Disease Testing Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is a minimally invasive method for specimen collection with potential multifaceted uses, particularly for serosurveillance of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed DBS as a potential specimen type for assessing IgG and total (including IgG and IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated and naturally infected patients. METHODS: Six candidate buffers were assessed for eluting blood from DBS cards. The study utilized one hundred and five paired plasma specimens and DBS specimens from prospectively collected SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals, remnants from those with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, or remnants from those without history of infection or vaccination. All specimens were tested with the Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total assay (COV2T) or IgG assay (sCOVG). RESULTS: The lowest backgrounds were observed with water and PBS, and water was used for elution. Relative to plasma samples, DBS samples had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 94.4% (95% CI: 94.9C100%) for COV2T and 79.2 (68.4C87.0) for sCOVG using the manufacturers cutoff. The NPA was 100 % (87.1C100.0 and 85.13C100) for both assays. Dilution studies revealed 100% (95% CI: 90.8C100%) qualitative agreement between specimen types on the COV2T assay and 98.0% (88.0C99.9%) with the sCOVG using study defined cutoffs. CONCLUSION: DBS specimens demonstrated high PPA and NPA relative to plasma for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, and ACO on COVID-19. METHODS: In total, 5625 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were divided into asthma, COPD, ACO, and control groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality rate. To find out whether chronic obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, COPD, and ACO affect COVID-19 mortality, 1:4 matching was performed, except for the ACO group alone due to a small number of patients. RESULTS: The mortality rates of asthma, COPD, and ACO groups were about 2.3, 4.8, and 5.5 times higher than that of the control group, respectively. Although not statistically significant, the survival probability tended to decrease (asthma, COPD, and combined groups of asthma and ACO, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.84, 1.31, and 1.89, respectively). The survival probability of the combined groups of COPD, ACO, and asthma and the combined groups of COPD and ACO was significantly lower than that of the matched control group (HR: 3.00 and 1.99, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared to patients with COVID-19 without chronic obstructive airway disease, patients with these comorbidities are more likely to require oxygen and mechanical ventilators and have a higher mortality rate, which can be considered when classifying and monitoring patients in the era of COVID-19. Therefore, further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of chronic obstructive airway disease, especially ACO, on COVID-19 mortality.","output":"Impact of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma-COPD overlap on the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality, primarily due to increased complication rates among the elderly population and patients with chronic diseases.

Variables that may influence surrogate decision making have been proposed. Little work has examined relations between these variables and outcomes of surrogate decision making. This study investigated whether surrogates characteristics, including their knowledge of treatment options, and interpersonal factors predicted surrogates accuracy and intervention selections. Specifically, predictor variables included: trust in the medical profession, trait-level anxiety, depression, anxiety about COVID-19, religiosity, perceived emotional support, understanding of treatment options, empathy, willingness to accept responsibility for medical decisions, reluctance to burden others, and perceived similarity between oneself and the patient. METHODS: 154 pairs of patients and their surrogates completed an online survey. Patients indicated preferred treatments in hypothetical decision scenarios. Surrogates indicated the treatment that they thought the patient would prefer. RESULTS: When taken all together in a predictive model, the variables significantly predicted surrogates? accuracy, F (6) = 3.03, R(2) = .12, p = .008. Variables also predicted selection of intensive interventions, F (4) = 5.95, R(2) = .14, p = .00. Surrogates reporting greater anxiety about COVID-19 selected more intensive interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior research, this study found that surrogates characteristics influence the interventions they choose, with anxiety about COVID-19 having considerable bearing on their chosen interventions.

In the absence of firm evidence, these have been developed by expert committees, limited in participant number. This study aimed to validate international COVID-19 surgical guidance using a rapid Delphi consensus exercise. METHODS: Delphi statements were directly mapped to guidance from surgical professional bodies in the US and Europe (SAGES/EAES), the UK (Joint RCS), and Australasia (RACS), to validate content against international consensus. Agreement from &#8805;70% participants was determined as consensus agreement. RESULTS: The Delphi exercise was completed by 339 individuals from 41 countries and 52 statements were mapped to the guidance, 47 (90.4%) reaching consensus agreement. Of these, 27 statements were mapped to SAGES/EAES guidance, 21 to the Joint RCS document, and 33 to the RACS document. Within the SAGES/EAES document, 92.9% of items reached consensus agreement (median 89.0%, range 60.5-99.2%), 90.4% within the Joint RCS document (87.6%, 63.4-97.9%), and 90.9% within the RACS document (85.5%, 18.7-98.8%).

Given wide disparities in the pandemic's impact across communities, neighborhood deprivation may explain observed variation in the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and preterm delivery. Objective To characterize changes in the incidence of PTD during the COVID-19 pandemic with attention to effect modification introduced by neighborhood hardship. Study Design This retrospective cohort study included all pregnant patients who delivered at an urban tertiary care hospital during the pandemic (April-November 2020) or pre-pandemic (April-November 2019). We compared the incidence of PTD, spontaneous PTD, and medically indicated PTD prior to 37 weeks gestation across epochs. Planned analyses stratified the cohorts by neighborhood deprivation metrics defined by residential zip code, including median neighborhood household income and hardship index (a composite index including dependency, educational attainment, unemployment, poverty, per capita income, and crowded housing). The Breslow-Day test for homogeneity assessed the association of delivery epoch and neighborhood deprivation with PTD outcome. Results Of 16,544 eligible deliveries, 8.7% occurred preterm. Incidences of PTD (8.4% vs. 9.0%, p=0.17), spontaneous PTD (5.0 vs 5.4%, p=0.27), and medically indicated PTD (3.2% v 3.5%, p=0.47) were similar between the pandemic and pre-pandemic epochs. However, PTD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96) and spontaneous PTD (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.99) decreased from the pre-pandemic to pandemic epoch in those living in neighborhoods <50th percentile for median income (Breslow-Day p-values 0.047 and 0.036, respectively). Similarly, PTD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.97) and spontaneous PTD (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.98) decreased for those inhabiting neighborhoods in the highest-hardship quartile (Breslow-Day p-values 0.045 and 0.029, respectively). Conclusion Populations residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods experienced reductions in preterm delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Neighborhood-level social determinants of health offer insight into the complex etiologies that contribute to preterm delivery, and provide opportunities for public health, equity-focused prevention strategies.","output":"Neighborhood deprivation and preterm delivery during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine, including video-, web-, and telephone-based interventions, is used in adult and pediatric populations to deliver health care and communicate with patients. In the realm of hematology, telemedicine has recently been used to safely and efficiently monitor treatment side-effects, perform consultations, and broaden the reach of subspecialty care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize and analyze information regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefits of telemedicine interventions in malignant and nonmalignant hematology, as well as assess the recognized limitations of these interventions. METHODS: Studies were identified through a comprehensive Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search on the PubMed MEDLINE, Controlled Register of Clinical Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL from Wiley), Embase, and CINAHL (EBSCO) databases on February 7, 2018. A second search, utilizing the same search strategy, was performed on October 1, 2020. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the reporting of included evidence. Included studies were original articles researching the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of telemedicine or telehealth interventions in pediatric or adult populations with malignant or nonmalignant hematological conditions. Data items in the extraction form included first author name, publication year, country, malignant or nonmalignant hematological condition or disease focus of the study, participant age, participant age subgroup (pediatric or adult), study design and setting, telemedicine intervention type and description, study purpose, and main study outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 32 articles met the preset criteria and were included in this study. Most (25/32) studies were conducted in adults, and the remaining (7/32) were conducted in the pediatric population. Of the 32 studies, 12 studied malignant hematological conditions, 18 studied nonmalignant conditions, and two studied both malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Study types included pilot study (11/32), retrospective study (9/32), randomized controlled trial (6/32), cross-sectional study (2/32), case study (1/32), pre-post study (1/32), noncomparative prospective study (1/32), and prospective cohort study (1/32). The three main types of telemedicine interventions utilized across all studies were video-based (9/32), telephone-based (9/32), and web-based interventions (14/32). Study results showed comparable outcomes between telemedicine and traditional patient encounter groups across both pediatric and adult populations for malignant and nonmalignant hematological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine use in nonmalignant and malignant hematology provides similar or improved health care compared to face-to-face encounters in both pediatric and adult populations. Telemedicine interventions utilized in the included studies were well received in both pediatric and adult settings. However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of implementing more widespread use of telemedicine for hematological conditions.","output":"Telemedicine in Malignant and Nonmalignant Hematology: Systematic Review of Pediatric and Adult Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) causes severe illness and multi\\\\organ dysfunction.

Much of this research has involved studies of experimentally induced URTIs or laboratory studies of naturally occurring illnesses. The results from this research have implications for performance at work and in education. Aims: The present article presents a case study of the association between URTIs and academic performance and reports the use of such information as an extenuating circumstance for poor performance. Methods: The paper describes the poor performance of a primary school student taking the 11+ examination, which determines the choice of the future secondary school. Evidence suggested that it was plausible that the student was incubating an URTI at the time of the examination. Other possible infections, such as COVID, were ruled out. An appeal was made based on the possible association between incubating an URTI and unusually poor examination performance. Results: The appeal was supported by the adjudicating committee and the student was allowed a place in the preferred secondary school. Conclusions: This case study shows that information about the association between URTIs and mental performance can be used as an extenuating circumstance that can plausibly account for poor academic performance. This can form the basis of the future appeals and recommendations for the type of evidence needed to make such claims are made.

MATERIALS: We evaluated trends in patient encounters and laboratory testing for DM in a pediatric healthcare system from March to September 2019 and during the same period in 2020. RESULTS: Evaluation of 17,367 patient encounters illustrated that the pandemic was associated with significantly fewer in-person office visits and point-of-care HbA1c tests for patients with DM in 2020 relative to 2019. A separate analysis of 7,193 HbA1c results measured by point-of-care testing in the general population found a significant increase in the number of measured HbA1c >14 % in May 2020 relative to 2019, but other measured HbA1c values did not differ. As a means to address lapses in the monitoring of HbA1c due to the pandemic, we evaluated the use of the dried blood spot (DBS) matrix for measurement of HbA1c by the Vitros 5600 chemistry analyzer. DBS HbA1c was well correlated to whole blood (r=0.9889) and exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision from 0.5-3.5%.

RESULTS: Among baseline never users of nonmedical prescription opioids (N = 3204), average past 6-month prevalence of new nonmedical prescription opioid use across the 42-month follow-up was 4.4% (range 3.5%-6.1%). In a multivariable model co-adjusting for 9 baseline behavioral problems and other factors, major depression, hypomania or mania, cannabis, alcohol, and other drug use problems were associated with increased odds of nonmedical prescription opioid use over follow-ups. Cumulative indices of behavioral health comorbidity showed successively greater odds of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use for students with 1 (odds ratio [OR]: 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.79-5.01), 2 (OR: 8.79; 95% CI: 5.95-12.99), or 3 (OR: 9.69; 95% CI: 5.63-16.68) vs 0 baseline substance use problems, and similar increases were associated with increasing number of mental health problems (1 [OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03-2.88] to all 6 [OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.09-14.82] vs 0). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral health problems may be associated with increased risk of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use during mid to late adolescence, with successively greater risk for those with greater behavioral health comorbidity. In pediatric clinical practice or school-based prevention, behavioral health screeners may be useful for identifying youth at high risk for nonmedical prescription opioid use.","output":"Behavioral Health Risk Factors for Nonmedical Prescription Opioid Use in Adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis impacted negatively sustainable growth and the wellbeing of businesses and national economies. The economic outlook of 2020 and 2021 reflects a slowdown in the global economy, with poverty and unemployment rates ascending, national debts growing, and fiscal and monetary burden increasing. All the sectors of the economy have been affected across all of the EU countries, including the agricultural sector. Coronavirus posed unprecedented challenges for the agricultural sector, ranging from a labour shortage to demand changes. Lockdowns caused immense disturbances in farmers' supply chains, causing them to doubt their long-term viability. Due to the social distancing and restrictions on social gatherings, marketplaces either closed or were devoid of customers. At the same time, the agricultural sector has proved quite resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. In this paper, we discuss the challenges which the agricultural sector has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggest that further growth and development can be sustained through innovation, more precisely, digital technology. The current conceptual research contributes to the body by exploring the effect of the novel COVID-19 virus on national economies and especially the agricultural sector.","output":"The COVID-19 crisis: implications for the development and growth of agricultural sector in EU countries and Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid development of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies, yeast has been generally considered as promising hosts for the bioproduction of secondary metabolites.

The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long-lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic reorganization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas carbon dioxide (CO2). We confirm that when coupled to CO2 presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states. Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2 but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.","output":"Switch-like and persistent memory formation in individual Drosophila larvae."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The traditional apprentice model of teaching therapeutic endoscopic skills is inadequate due to unpredictable frequency and high stakes for patient outcome. Simulation had gained widespread acceptance for training modules. But all the procedures cannot be trained on simulator. We designed a novel human cadaver hands-on training module for practicing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL), endoscopic injection (EI), snare polypectomy (SP), thermal cautery (TC), and endoscopic clip (EC) placement. Methods A single preserved pre-coronavirus disease 2019 human cadaver was used as a training model. Twelve trainees (6 teams) used the module to acquire and practice new skills of PEG, EVL, EI, SP, and EC using standard endoscope and regular endoscopic accessories. All the trainees completed the course evaluation using a 5-point Likert scale (5= strongly agree). Results The training resulted in a self-reported increase in equipment familiarity and all the trainees felt uniformly that they are better prepared for performing the procedures on real patients. They strongly agreed that this exhaustive hands-on exercise has more educational value than attending lectures.

METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered during the third week of March 2020, and post-stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ-R scores than their counterparts (p < .000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES-D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (p < .000). Additionally, resource measures are significant and negatively related to suicidality (p < .000).

Drawing on the health belief model, perceived scarcity, and anticipated regret theories, this paper formulated a theoretical model that linked the determinants of panic buying and analyzed their interrelationships. Subsequently, data were collated from 508 consumers through an online survey questionnaire in Singapore that was conducted during the early stage of the pandemic, before the onset of the circuit breaker in April 2020. Next, an analysis of the results was done through structural equation modeling. It showed that the effect of the health belief model dimensions (i.e., perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectation, cues to action, and self-efficacy) on panic buying is partially mediated by the consumers' perceived scarcity of products. Furthermore, the effect of perceived scarcity on panic buying is partially mediated by consumers' anticipation of regret.

Recent studies found increased risk of coronavirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. AIMS: Our aim is to analyse the association between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 3520 HCWs at a large hospital in Northern Italy. For each participant, we collected data on flu immunization status for the last five flu seasons. Logistic regression was used to test associations between seasonal flu vaccination status and a positive serology tests for COVID-19. RESULTS: During the last five flu seasons, 2492 vaccinations were administered. Serology tests were negative for 3196 (91%) HCWs and residents and only 21 (1%) people had an equivocal test (12.0-15.0 AU/mL). Only 128 (4%) people received a diagnosis of COVID-19, with a positive swab test. No flu vaccinations for the last five flu seasons were specifically associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 or with positive results of serology tests.

The Telemedicine Practice Guidelines and Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines (TPOG) released in 2020 have been received by the fraternity with a mixture of apprehension, relief, and dissatisfaction on the list of drugs provided in Lists O, A, B, and C. Many psychiatrists have raised the issues of having a consensus in the formulation of List A. AIMS: To draw consensus on the medications that can be listed in Lists O, A, B, and C in TPOG-2020. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was an online survey with ethics approval by the Indian Psychiatric Society Ethics Review Board. All psychiatrists, who are members of the Indian Psychiatric Society and whose E-mail address was available with the society, were sent the survey link by E-mail. METHODOLOGY: Opinions and suggestions on Lists O, A, B, and C of TPOG-2020 and reasons for the suggestions were collected. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Frequency, percentages, mean, and standard deviation were calculated. T-test and Chi-square tests were used to see the influence of demographics on the concurrence of the lists. RESULTS: Responses from 340 responders were analyzed. Majority of the responders agreed that List O (277, 85.5%), List B (263, 82.4%), and List C (223, 69%) are apt except for List A (162, 50.3%). CONCLUSIONS: This online survey showed that majority of the responders agreed to the lists except for List A. The approach taken to include the medications in List A, which was to include the essential drugs, has various benefits.

Real-life data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80 years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination campaigns. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of 60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: While the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2% had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. CONCLUSION: Our data showed differences between the antibody responses raised after the first and second BNT162b2 vaccination, in particular lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies in the elderly group. This suggests that this population needs to be closely monitored and may require earlier revaccination or/and an increased vaccine dose to ensure stronger long lasting immunity and protection against infection.","output":"Age-dependent immune response to the Biontech/Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a rapidly growing pandemic that has grown from a few cases in Wuhan, China to millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide within a few months.

METHODS: A total of 309 patients admitted to the emergency department and subsequently confirmed COVID-19 cases was examined. Patients with pneumonia symptoms, chest computerized tomography scan, venous blood gas findings, and confirmed COVID-19 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were consecutively enrolled. Multiple linear regression was used to predict computerized tomography and blood gas findings by clinical/laboratory data. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 51 (interquartile range 39-66), and 51.5% were male. The mortality rate at the end of follow-up was 18.8%. With respect to survival status of patients pCO2 and HCO3 levels and total computerized tomography score values were found to be higher in the surviving patients (p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively), whereas pH and lactate levels were higher in patients who died (p=0.022 and p=0.001, respectively). With logistic regression analysis, total tomography score was found to be significantly effective on mortality (p<0.001).

Patients and methods  In 1,344,355 persons aged  35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results  After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR 0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR 0.6).

Transplant recipients are among the high-risk groups and are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. According to the available data about COVID-19 vaccines, some platform technologies include vector-based, inactivated, protein subunit, virus-like particles, mRNA, and DNA vaccines (1). There are several guidelines about vaccination in immunocompromised individuals for both non-live- and live vaccines. However, there are still limited evidence-based data about COVID-19 vaccines in the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and establishing a proper recommendation for vaccination in these patients would be challenging (2, 3). Transplant recipients may have shown lesser responses to the vaccines compared with the general population, and it is unknown to what extent the vaccine is effective in this group of patients. Also, in many countries, the vaccination schedule is not adjustable by the patients or physicians, and selecting a particular time window for the best efficacy of immunization is impossible. In this regard, the main concern in the patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs is not worsening symptoms and disease following vaccination. The most critical issue is determining the best time for vaccination to increase its efficacy. Here are some considerations about vector-based, inactivated, and mRNA- nanoparticle vaccines, but most evidence is not based on the results of cohort or clinical trial studies. Before HSCT, patients could receive the COVID-19 vaccine if they are not already immunosuppressed. According to evidence about other inactivated vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, the interval to start the conditioning regimen could be considered 2 - 4 weeks following the vaccination (4). In autologous HSCT patients, COVID-19 vaccination can be considered 1 - 3 months after transplantation if there has been a community outbreak. If acquiring or transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was well controlled, vaccination could be withheld after six months of transplantation. In the current pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination in allogeneic HSCT patients could be considered at least three months after transplantation. If transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was controlled, vaccination could be withheld after six months of transplantation (4-6). Vaccination of patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) receiving less than 20 mg/day prednisolone (or equivalent) for less than 2 weeks, can be considered similar to the HSCT recipients with no GVHD (5). Vaccines in HSCT recipients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection are not effective thus, receiving the vaccine is not recommended. If an HSCT recipient has received the COVID-19 vaccine before HSCT, re-vaccination after transplantation is suggested (6). The administration of the vaccine is considered when the immune system acquired functional competence. Transplant donation should not be delayed due to the vaccination of the donor to protect the patients in case the transplant is urgent (6). It was reported that recipients who have received anti-B cell antibodies might get the vaccine at 3 - 6 months after the administration and four weeks before the next course of B cell-depleting therapy. If this time window was not possible, vaccination can be regarded under B-cell depleting therapy, considering a suboptimal response to the vaccine (7).

It is not clear, though, how much risk of mortality their different levels of elevations entail, and which marker signifies more risk than others and how much. This study was undertaken to describe their levels and to answer these questions regarding eight inflammatory markers, namely, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, LDH, CPK, troponin-I. Methods: The data were retrieved from the electronic records of 19852 CoViD-19 patients admitted to a chain of hospitals in north India from March 2020 to July 2021. Levels for most markers were available for more than 10,000 patients. In view of widely different ranges of values of different markers, we divided their values into quintiles (Qs) and studied the pattern of mortality and for running the logistic regression. In addition, logarithm transformation was also tried. The statistical distribution of the values was compared by Mann-Whitney test. Relative importance was judged by the mortality rates, area under the ROC curves (AUROCs), and the odds ratios. Results: Although the mortality increased with decreasing ALC and increasing level of all the other markers, more than 70% survived even with levels in the extreme quintile. The adjusted odds ratio was the highest (7.62) for the Q5 levels of IL-6, closely followed by D-dimer (OR = 6.04). The AUROC was the highest (0.817) for LDH and the least (0.612) for CPK. However, the optimal cut-off for any marker could correctly classify not more than 80% deaths and the multivariable logistic regression could correctly classify patients with mortality in less than 24% cases. Conclusion: Although elevated levels of all the markers and low values of ALC were significant risk factor but no firm evidence was available for any of the eight markers to be a major indicator of the mortality in COVID-19 unless they reach to a critical threshold. Among those studied, D-Dimer (>192 ng/mL) followed by IL-6 (>4.5 pg/mL) had stronger association with mortality even with moderate and higher end of the normal levels and LDH (>433 U/L) and troponin-I (>0.002ng/mL) with only steeply increased levels.

Rather than feeding the range-Doppler spectrum sequence into a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected with recurrent neural networks, the proposed framework takes the aforementioned feature cube as input of a shallow CNN for gesture recognition to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a hand activity detection (HAD) algorithm to automatize the detection of gestures in real-time case. The proposed HAD can capture the time-stamp at which a gesture finishes and feeds the hand profile of all the relevant measurement-cycles before this time-stamp into the CNN with low latency. Since the proposed framework is able to detect and classify gestures at limited computational cost, it could be deployed in an edge-computing platform for real-time applications, whose performance is notedly inferior to a state-of-the-art personal computer.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of billing data. SETTING: A large-volume practice with both community and tertiary care providers. METHODS: As part of a quality initiative, billing data were queried to identify children <18 years of age who underwent tympanostomy tube placement between January 2019 and December 2020. Patient age, practice location, and case numbers were gathered. RESULTS: The study included data from 2652 patients. Prior to state-mandated clinic and operating room restrictions, there were no significant differences in the number of tympanostomy tubes placed (P = .64), including month-to-month comparisons, the distribution of patients being cared for at community vs tertiary care sites (P = .63), or patient age at the time of surgery (P = .97) between 2019 and 2020. After resumption of outpatient clinical and elective surgical activities, the number of tympanostomy tubes placed decreased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (831 vs 303 cases, P = .003), with a persistent month-to-month difference. In addition, patients undergoing tube placement were older (4.5 vs 3.2 years, P < .001). The distribution of cases performed in the community setting decreased during this time period as well (P < .001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of pediatric tympanostomy tube placement has significantly decreased.

We evaluated the relevance of a new syndromic rapid multiplex PCR test (rm-PCR) on respiratory samples to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study was conducted in four French university hospitals. Respiratory samples were obtained from patients with clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia and simultaneously tested using conventional microbiological methods and the rm-PCR. A committee composed of an intensivist, a microbiologist, and an infectious diseases specialist retrospectively assessed all medical files and agreed on the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for each pneumonia episode, according to the results of rm-PCR and blinded to the culture results. The rm-PCR-guided antimicrobial regimen was compared to the empirical treatment routinely administered to the patient in standard care. RESULTS: We included 159 pneumonia episodes. Most patients were hospitalized in intensive care units (n = 129, 81%), and episodes were HAP (n = 68, 43%), CAP (n = 54, 34%), and VAP (n = 37, 23%). Conventional culture isolated  1 microorganism(s) at significant level in 95 (60%) patients. The syndromic rm-PCR detected at least one bacteria in 132 (83%) episodes. Based on the results of the rm-PCR, the multidisciplinary committee proposed a modification of the empirical therapy in 123 (77%) pneumonia episodes. The modification was a de-escalation in 63 (40%), an escalation in 35 (22%), and undetermined in 25 (16%) patients. In microbiologically documented episodes (n = 95), the rm-PCR increased appropriateness of the empirical therapy to 83 (87%), as compared to 73 (77%) in routine care.

Our objective was to quantify patient lifetime benefits gained from faster treatment. METHODS Observational prospective data of consecutive stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in Australian and Finnish centers (1998-2011; n=2258) provided distributions of age, sex, stroke severity, onset-to-treatment times, and 3-month modified Rankin Scale in daily clinical practice. Treatment effects derived from a pooled analysis of thrombolysis trials were used to model the shift in 3-month modified Rankin Scale distributions with reducing treatment delays, from which we derived the expected lifetime and level of long-term disability with faster treatment. RESULTS Each minute of onset-to-treatment time saved granted on average 1.8 days of extra healthy life (95% prediction interval, 0.9-2.7). Benefit was observed in all groups: each minute provided 0.6 day in old severe (age, 80 years; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score, 20) patients, 0.9 day in old mild (age, 80 years; NIHSS score, 4) patients, 2.7 days in young mild (age, 50 years; NIHSS score, 4) patients, and 3.5 days in young severe (age, 50 years; NIHSS score, 20) patients. Women gained slightly more than men over their longer lifetimes. In the whole cohort, each 15 minute decrease in treatment delay provided an average equivalent of 1 month of additional disability-free life.

In the present study, using in silico tools, the gene expression and genetic alteration of TMPRSS4 were analysed across numerous tumours and compared to controls.

METHODS: Testosterone and tenascin-C levels were measured in sera of 412 men with MDD and 237 age- and sex-matched controls. Serum levels of thyroid hormone, lipids, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were also quantified. Potential associations were examined using covariance, subgroup analysis, and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Significantly higher concentrations of tenascin-C were detected in sera of subjects with MDD than in controls. Among subjects with MDD, testosterone concentrations inversely correlated with tenascin-C levels.

Conclusion: Although a low proportion of COVID-19 patients have influenza co-infection, however, the importance of such co-infection, especially in high-risk individuals and the elderly, cannot be ignored. We were unable to report the exact rate of simultaneous influenza in COVID-19 patients worldwide due to a lack of data from several countries. Obviously, more studies are needed to evaluate the exact effect of the COVID-19 and influenza co-infection in clinical outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 and Influenza Co-infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because achievement goals are context-specific, the study first investigated the evolution of two achievement goals of 697 regular athletes, namely self-approach goals (improving oneself) and self-avoidance goals (avoiding regression), before and during the confinement situation and the physical exercise restrictions due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Secondly, we sought to examine the potential predicting role of self-approach and self-avoidance goals on athletes intention to exercise during confinement, while self-avoidance goals were usually not related to this outcome in a more traditional context. Using a retrospective correlational design, the results of repeated measures ANOVA highlighted that self-approach goals scores decreased while self-avoidance goals scores increased and became the athletes goals with the highest score during confinement. The results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that self-approach and self-avoidance goals were both found as positive predictors of intention to exercise during confinement. This study reinforces the assumptions that (a) a specific achievement setting encourages the adoption of different achievement goals (which was identified here with regular athletes in an unusual context of confinement), (b) self-avoidance goals are not always maladaptive, and (c) shifting among multiple goals according to the requirements of the situation may be beneficial.","output":"Confinement during Covid-19 outbreak modifies athletes self-based goals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, Brazil was the leading country in COVID-19 cases in Latin America, and capital cities were the most severely affected by the outbreak. Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.","output":"Meteorological and human mobility data on predicting COVID-19 cases by a novel hybrid decomposition method with anomaly detection analysis: a case study in the capitals of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short report is dedicated to the description of the wide antiviral and antibacterial activity of the immune-modulating agent Panavir?.

The purpose of the paper is to analyse the association between knowledge and behaviour of touch screen users based on surveys. This paper presents selected results of a survey conducted at the end of 2019 (preCCOVIDC19 survey). The survey was conducted on a group of 172 IT school students. The relationship between responses using a 2D linear model regression and clustering is used. Most respondents believe that bacteria were more common than viruses on touch screens. The respondents declare altruism in terms of a greater willingness to lend their smartphone, rather than to use someone elses. An interesting result is that respondents often lend their smartphone to others, while being aware that viruses or bacteria are present on the touch screens. The results can be used in terms of changes in the education process of smartphone users in relation to microbiological hazards.","output":"The Associations between Knowledge and Behaviours Related to Touch Screens and Microbiological Threats among IT Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this response to 'The impact of COVID-19 on medical electives in plastic surgery - A medical students' perspective' by U.

Existing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy research focuses on the general population, but less is known about the specific concerns of medically vulnerable populations, including individuals with cancer. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis used data that assessed likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination (likely vs unlikely/unsure) among past or current patients with cancer from a nationwide survey administered in December 2020 by the Patient Advocate Foundation (PAF), a non-profit organization that provides case management and financial aid to patients diagnosed with a chronic illness. Inclusion criteria included previous or current cancer treatment, aged  19, and a valid e-mail address. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and urban/rural residence were abstracted from the PAF database. Respondents self-reported education level, employment status, trust in media regarding COVID-19 pandemic, and media viewership on COVID-19 vaccine development. The Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale assessed respondents' level of mistrust in medical providers based on ethnicity. Likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was evaluated using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from modified Poisson regression models with robust error variance. All variables were included in our model. Results: Of 429 respondents, 48% were unlikely/unsure about accepting the COVID-19 vaccine, primarily due to concerns about vaccine safety (32%) and worry about health conditions (12%). When compared to those likely to accept COVID-19 vaccine, respondents who were unlikely/unsure were more often Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (40% vs. 23%), aged 36-55 (40% vs. 29%), and female (80% vs. 65%). In adjusted analysis, Black respondents were 55% less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, when compared to White respondents (RR 0.55;95% CI 0.4-0.8). When compared to those who did not follow the media regarding COVID-19 vaccine development, those who followed the media very closely were 4.5 times more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (RR 4.5;95% CI 1.6-13.2). Respondents who reported below average trust in the media were 60% less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (RR 0.6;95% CI 0.5-0.8), compared to those who reported above average trust in the media. Conclusions: Despite being at high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, a substantial proportion of under-resourced individuals with cancer were unlikely/unsure about vaccination, exposing a significant disconnect between risk of severe disease and vaccine acceptance.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CNKI and MedRxiv of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2020 to 15 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies examining the following demographics and outcomes were included: patients age; sex; incidence of and risk factors for AKI and their impact on prognosis; COVID-19 disease type and incidence of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) administration during COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 79 research articles, including 49 692 patients with COVID-19, met the systemic evaluation criteria. The mortality rate and incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 in China were significantly lower than those in patients with COVID-19 outside China. A significantly higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 from North America were aged 65 years and also developed AKI. European patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher mortality and a higher CRRT rate than patients from other regions. Further analysis of the risk factors for COVID-19 combined with AKI showed that age 60 years and severe COVID-19 were independent risk factors for AKI, with an OR of 3.53, 95% CI (2.92C4.25) and an OR of 6.07, 95% CI (2.53C14.58), respectively. The CRRT rate in patients with severe COVID-19 was significantly higher than in patients with non-severe COVID-19, with an OR of 6.60, 95% CI (2.83C15.39). The risk of death in patients with COVID-19 and AKI was significantly increased, with an OR of 11.05, 95% CI (9.13C13.36). CONCLUSION: AKI was a common and serious complication of COVID-19. Older age and having severe COVID-19 were independent risk factors for AKI.

Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients present other severe damage such as cardiovascular, renal and liver injury or/and multiple organ failure, suggesting a spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in blood. Recent ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology now allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids in plasma. We herein intended to use the droplet-based digital PCR technology to obtain sensitive detection and precise quantification of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral load (SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 8 to 12 days after onset of symptoms and 12 healthy controls were analyzed. Disease severity was categorized as mild-to-moderate in 17 patients, severe in 16 patients and critical in 26 patients. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was quantified by droplet digital Crystal Digital PCR&#8482; next-generation technology (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif, France). RESULTS: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was detected in 43 (74.1%) patients. Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia correlated with disease severity, ranging from 53% in mild-to-moderate patients to 88% in critically ill patients (p=0.036). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia were associated with severity (p=0.035). Among nine patients who experienced clinical deterioration during follow-up, eight had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at baseline while only one critical patient with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at the time of analysis died at day 27.

However, early classes might impede learning by contributing to absenteeism and insufficient sleep. We used big datasets collected passively from university students to test the hypothesis that morning classes are associated with poorer attendance, shorter sleep, and lower grades. Wi-Fi connection data were used to estimate attendance rates of 24,678 students enrolled in lecture courses with start times ranging from 08:00 to 16:00. Students interactions with the universitys Learning Management System (LMS) were used to estimate nocturnal sleep opportunities by compiling 17.4 million logins from 39,458 students with data sorted by students first class of the day. Objective sleep behavior was assessed in 181 students who took part in a 6-week actigraphy study. We found that Wi-Fi confirmed attendance was about 15 percentage points lower in students taking classes at 08:00 compared with later start times. Actigraphy data revealed that students frequently slept past the start of morning classes. LMS and actigraphy data showed that nocturnal sleep opportunities and total sleep time decreased with earlier class start times due to students waking up earlier. Analyses of grades in 27,281 students showed that having morning classes on more days of the week resulted in a lower grade point average. These findings suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on learning. Early morning classes force many students to decide to either sleep more and skip class, or sleep less to attend class. Therefore, universities should avoid scheduling early morning classes. Significance Statement We show that morning classes are associated with lower attendance, shorter nocturnal sleep, and lower grade point average in university students. Scalable methods for measuring attendance and sleep were developed using students Wi-Fi connection data and interactions with the Learning Management System. Students had lower attendance rates and frequently slept past the start of early morning classes. However, students still lost about an hour of sleep on average when they had early morning classes due to waking up earlier than usual. Students who had morning classes on more days of the week had a lower grade point average. Our results suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on students academic performance.

Participants included patients from 18 years of age hospitalized with Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset enrolled at a university and a community hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Exclusion criteria included prior intensive care unit (ICU) admission and use of ARBs/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at randomization. Control arm received standard care alone and treatment arm telmisartan 80 mg twice daily for 14 days. Primary outcomes were C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Secondary outcomes included time to discharge within 15 days, admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days. NCT04355936 (Completed). FINDINGS: A pragmatic decision to end the study before the third interim analysis was made on Oct. 30th due to sharp reduction in recruitment. A total of 162 patients were randomized. 158 patients enrolled between May 14 and October 30 2020, were included in the analysis, 80 in the standard care and 78 in the telmisartan added to standard care group. Baseline absolute CRP serum levels were 5.53  6.19 mg/dL (95% CI 6.91 to 4.15, n = 80) and 9.04  7.69 (95% CI 9.04 to 10.82, n = 74) in the standard care and telmisartan added to standard care groups, respectively. Day 5 control-group CRP levels were 6.06  6.95 mg/dL (95% CI 7.79C4.35, n = 66) while telmisartan group were 3.83  5.08 mg/dL (95% CI 5.08C2.59, n = 66, p = 0.038). Day 8 CRP levels were 6.30  8.19 mg/dL (95% CI 8.79C3.81, n = 44) and 2.37  3.47 mg/dL (95% CI 3.44C1.30, n = 43, p = 0.0098) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively (all values expressed as mean  SD). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that telmisartan-treated patients had a lower median time-to-discharge (control=15 days; telmisartan=9 days). Death by day 30 was reduced in the telmisartan-treated group (control 22.54%, 16/71; telmisartan 4.29%, 3/70 participants; p = 0.0023).

Despite the commitment of professional societies such as the American College of Radiology to diversity in Radiology, the field and its residency training programs remain the least diverse. With COVID-19 related suspension of in-person medical student rotations, our Department of Radiology redesigned and implemented a virtual radiology internship for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students. METHODS: A four-week virtual radiology internship was designed to provide clinical exposure to radiology and to allow students to gain an understanding of what a career in radiology entails. Course design included videoconference patient care sessions, didactic lectures, online modules, mentoring, and extra-clinical curriculum. Feedback from students was collected using online surveys assessing pre- and postcourse attitudes and understanding of a career in radiology and the students' perceived aptitude for such a career, as well as course component evaluation. RESULTS: Three participants were enrolled in the inaugural clerkship. All noted exceptional educational course content and ample opportunities to build connections with faculty and residents-with mentoring seen as the highlight of the course. All indicated a significant shift in perception of the field and in declaring interest in pursuing a career in radiology. CONCLUSION: Virtual radiology internship for URM students is a feasible paradigm to address potential impediments to diversification of the specialty by both engaging interested URM medical students in a career in radiology and arming them with the tools for a successful application to radiology residency.","output":"The Design and Preliminary Experience with a Virtual Diversity Visiting Student Acting Internship in Radiology for Underrepresented Minority Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design and development of novel adjuvants, which enhance, accelerate, and prolong the immune responses triggered by antigens, hold great importance for targeting infectious diseases and cancer. Here, we designed a biotinylated peptide amphiphile (Biotin-PA) nanofiber, which serves as a noncovalent binding location for antigens. We showed that presenting the antigens on synthetic Biotin-PA nanofibers generated a higher immune response than the free antigens delivered with a CpG ODN (TLR9 agonist) adjuvant. Antigen attached Biotin-PA nanofibers triggered splenocytes to produce high levels of cytokines (IFN-, IL-12, TNF-, and IL-6) and to exhibit a superior cross-presentation of the antigen. Both Biotin-PA nanofibers and CpG ODN induce a Th-1-biased IgG subclass response; however, delivering the antigen with Biotin-PA nanofibers induced significantly greater production of total IgG and subclasses of IgG compared to delivering the antigen with CpG ODN. Contrary to CpG ODN, Biotin-PA nanofibers also enhanced antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation and increased the proportion of the antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Given their biodegradability and biocompatibility, Biotin-PA nanofibers have a significant potential in immunoengineering applications as a biomaterial for the delivery of a diverse set of antigens derived from intracellular pathogens, emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19, or cancer cells to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against the antigens.

Within this context, one of the most ambitious implementation studies in addiction research is moving forward. Launched in May 2019, the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative (National Institutes of Health, 2020). The goal for this research was to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 40 % in three years by enhancing and integrating the delivery of multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) with proven effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose deaths across health care, justice, and community settings. This paper describes the initial vision, goals, and objectives of this initiative;the impact of COVID-19;and the potential for knowledge to be generated from HCS at the intersection of an unrelenting epidemic of opioid misuse and overdoses and the ravishing COVID-19 pandemic.. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration distributed more than $7 billion between January 2016 and June 2020 to address the drug overdose crisis. The funds were intended to support evidence-based responses, including medications for opioid use disorder, and other prevention, treatment and recovery activities. Although the SOR grants support much-needed community level interventions, many of the services they support may not be sustainable.Methods:: This paper describes a statewide effort to support local entities through SAMHSAs State Opioid Response (SOR) grants in Virginia. Our investigators conducted detailed needs assessment exercises with community agencies across the state, and collaboratively developed requests for proposals (RFPs) to sustain their SOR programs. We distributed the RFPs to prospective partners at universities across the state, and provided all responsive proposals to local agencies who selected the proposal most likely to meet their needs. Our investigators also conducted an inductive, three-phase content analysis approach to examine the RFPs submitted to the VHEOC to identify nominal categories of support requested of the academic partners.Results:: Our investigators received and coded 27 RFPs from ten community agencies representing four of five regions of the state. We identified six nominal categories of academic support with high inter-coder agreement. The six categories of support requested of the academic partners were program development and support, literature review and best practices, outreach and education, data analysis and interpretation, program evaluation, and grant writing assistance. Several RFPs requested up to three categories of support in a single project.Conclusions:: Our analysis of the requests received by the consortium identified several categories of academic support for SOR-grantees addressing the drug overdose crisis. The most common requests related to development and maintenance of supportive collaborations, which existing research has demonstrated is necessary for the long-term sustainability of SOR-funded services. In this way, the academic partners served as a source of support for sustainable SOR-funded programs. As the state opioid response program is implemented nationally, we hope that other states will consider similar models in response to the opioid crisis.","output":"Promoting Sustainable Responses to the US Opioid Epidemic with Community-Academic Partnerships: Qualitative Outcomes from a Statewide Program (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Transitioning from education to practice is stressful for new nurses and those entering new roles and can lead to workforce attrition and burnout.

We report the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation for megacolon in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery for transanal specimen retrieval and anastomosis to avoid the additional abdominal extraction incision. CASE DESCRIPTION Two cases are presented: case 1 was a 15-year-old boy who presented with intermittent abdominal distention, pain, and constipation for 3 years' duration and was diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease, and case 2 was a 60-year-old man who presented with repeated attacks of incomplete intestinal obstruction for 2 years' duration and was diagnosed with adult megacolon. They were treated by the total laparoscopic modified Duhamel operation without an abdominal extraction incision in combination with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. The operations were successfully accomplished without conversion to open surgery. The patients tolerated the procedure well, complained of minimal postoperative pain, and did not require narcotics beyond the day of the operation. No surgical complications occurred. Discharge from the hospital occurred on the ninth postoperative day in case 1 and the 13th postoperative day in case 2.

An emergent question for each hospital is how many general ward and intensive care unit beds are needed and how much personal protective equipment to be purchased. However, hospital pandemic preparedness has been hampered by a lack of sufficiently specific planning guidelines. In this paper, we developed a computer simulation approach to evaluating bed utilizations and the corresponding supply needs based on the operational considerations and constraints in individual hospitals. We built a data-driven SEIR model which is adaptive to control policies and can be utilized for regional forecast targeting a specific hospitals catchment area. The forecast model was integrated into a discrete-event simulation which modeled the patient flow and the interaction with hospital resources. We tested the simulation model outputs against patient census data from UF Health Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL. Simulation results were consistent with the observation that the hospital has ample bed resources to accommodate the regional COVID patients. After validation, the model was used to predict future bed utilizations given a spectrum of possible scenarios to advise bed planning and stockpiling decisions. Lastly, how to optimally allocate hospital resources to achieve the goal of reducing the case fatality rate while helping a maximum number of patients to recover was discussed.

Its impact on hospitalised patients is less well documented. METHODS: We collected viral sequences and clinical data of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 and hospital-onset COVID-19 infections (HOCIs), sampled 16 November 2020 to 10 January 2021, from eight hospitals participating in the COG-UK-HOCI study. Associations between the variant and the outcomes of all-cause mortality and intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission were evaluated using mixed effects Cox models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, care home residence, pregnancy and ethnicity. FINDINGS: Sequences were obtained from 2341 inpatients (HOCI cases=786) and analysis of clinical outcomes was carried out in 2147 inpatients with all data available. The HR for mortality of B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages was 1.01 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.28, p=0.94) and for ITU admission was 1.01 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.37, p=0.96). Analysis of sex-specific effects of B.1.1.7 identified increased risk of mortality (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.78, p=0.096) and ITU admission (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.90, p=0.011) in females infected with the variant but not males (mortality HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.10, p=0.177; ITU HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, p=0.086). INTERPRETATION: In common with smaller studies of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2, we did not find an overall increase in mortality or ITU admission associated with B.1.1.7 compared with other lineages. However, women with B.1.1.7 may be at an increased risk of admission to intensive care and at modestly increased risk of mortality.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with greater disease severity among hospitalised women but not men: multicentre cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models, the peak of infected individuals coincides with the inflection point of removed individuals Nevertheless, a survey based on the data of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Istanbul, Turkey displayed a time shift between the hospital referrals and fatalities An analysis of recent COVID-19 data and the records for Spanish flu (1918C1919) and SARS (2002C2004) epidemics confirm this observation We use multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time shift Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidence that the delay between the peak of (Formula presented ) and the peak of (Formula presented ) is approximately half of the infectious period of the epidemic disease In addition, we use a quadratic approximation to show that the distance between successive peaks of (Formula presented ) is (Formula presented ), where (Formula presented ) is the infectious period of the ith infectious stage, and we present numerical calculations that confirm this approximation ?

Lockdown and social distancing were mandated worldwide, resulting in closure of medical services. The diagnosis of various kidney diseases may have been delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic because non-urgent tests and visits were postponed due to closure of medical services during the lockdown. Based on previous reports, this afftects especially kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy and histological analysis for diagnosis. We have previously reported that during the lockdown period in March and April 2020, an incidence-shift with a COVID-19 gap of no diagnosed antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN) based on renal biopsy was followed by a postlockdown phase in subsequent months with a compensatory increased incidence rate. This has been attributed to a decreased number of renal biopsies during the lockdown period and a compensatory increased number in the postlockdown phase. We here expanded our analysis to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy. Furthermore, we aimed to identify effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes in patients with kidney diseases, including ANCA GN. With multiple vaccines currently undergoing human trials to combat this pandemic, there is an urgent need for a clear sense for patient populations most susceptible to shutdown of medical services. We here report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on native kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy for diagnosis in a retrospective observational study from a tertiary hospital in Germany. METHOD: A total number of 209 renal biopsies performed on native kidneys of patients hospitalized at the University Medical Center G?ttingen in 2019 and 2020 were included. Variables were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR), categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Statistical comparisons were not formally powered or prespecified. For group comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine differences in medians. Non-parametric between-group-comparisons were performed with Pearsons Chi-square test. Data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.0 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). RESULTS: The lockdown period in March and April 2020 primarily affected patients admitted to the normal medical ward with a compensatory increased rate of renal biopsies in the postlockdown phase. In addition, there was a shift towards more patients admitted with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon of an increased number of patients with hemoglobinuria during the COVID-19 pandemic was specifically observed in a subgroup with ANCA GN and hypertensive nephropathy requiring renal biopsy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of identifying a subpopulation susceptible to closure of medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnostic delay of specific kidney diseases. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic should be regarded as a risk factor especially in patients with diseases other than COVID-19 primarily admitted to the normal medical ward.","output":"MO205 IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON KIDNEY DISEASES REQUIRING RENAL BIOPSY: A SINGLE-CENTER OBSERVATIONAL STUDY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is emerging evidence of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the sanitary plumbing wastewater system, a known transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-1. These events can no longer be dismissed as isolated cases, yet a lack of awareness and of basic research makes it impossible to say just how widespread this mode of transmission might be. Virus is transmitted within wastewater systems by the aerosolisation of wastewater and subsequent transport of bioaerosols on naturally occurring airflows within the piped network. Central to the debate around risk to building occupants from SARS-CoV-2 spread via wastewater plumbing systems is the question of infectivity of faeces, urine and associated aerosols. This paper presents an examination of the processes which underlie this mode of transmission, and the existing epidemiological evidence, as well as existing mitigation strategies;significant gaps in the state of the knowledge are also identified. It is hoped that this review will cultivate a wider awareness and understanding of this most overlooked of threats, and to facilitate the selection and adoption of appropriate mitigation strategies. Key gaps in the knowledge span the rate of generation of bioaerosols within the building drainage system, their composition and transport properties, and the viability and infectivity of virions and other pathogens which they carry.

We found that some countries (such as the US, the UK, and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. At the same time, regardless of the best fitting law, most countries can be shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of Italy, but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with \`\`younger\\" epidemics tend to exhibit more exponential like behavior, while countries that are closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power-law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may not be a consequence of working non-pharmaceutical interventions (except for, perhaps, restricting the air travel). Instead, this is a normal course of raging infection spread. On the practical side, this cautions us against overly optimistic interpretations of the countries epidemic development and emphasizes the need to continue improving the compliance with social distancing behavior recommendations.","output":"Patterns of the COVID19 epidemic spread around the world: exponential vs power laws"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the question regarding the efficacy of various hygiene measures and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has become the focus of scientific and above all public discussion. To compare respirators, medical face masks, and cloth masks and determine if it is recommendable to wear face masks to protect the individual wearer of the mask from inhaling airborne particles, we challenged 29 different masks with aerosols and tested the pressure drop as a surrogate for breathing resistance owing to the mask material. We found that Type II medical face masks showed the lowest pressure drop (12.96.8 Pa/cm(2)) and therefore additional breathing resistance, whereas respirators such as the KN95 (32.37.0 Pa/cm(2)) and FFP2 (26.87.4 Pa/cm(2)) showed the highest pressure drops among the tested masks. The filtration efficacy of the mask material was the lowest for cloth masks (2825%) followed by non-certified face masks (6319%) and certified medical face masks (7010%). The materials of the different respirators showed very high aerosol retentions (KN95 [944%] and FFP2 [981%]). For evaluating the as-worn filtration performance simulating real live conditions each mask type was also tested on a standardized dummy head. Cloth masks and non-EN-certified face masks had the worst as-worn filtration efficacies among the tested masks, filtering less than 20% of the test aerosol. Remarkably, certified type II medical face masks showed similar (p>0.5) as-worn filtration results (4720%) than KN95 masks (414%) and FFP2 masks (6527%), despite having a lower pressure drop. Face shields did not show any significant retention function against aerosols in our experiment. Our results indicate that it seems recommendable to wear face masks for providing base protection and risk reduction against inhaling airborne particles, in low-risk situations.

To ensure high production through effective decision-making and auditable standards, producers are required to have better traceability and record systems. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) reviewing the current recording/data management and animal traceability systems used by small-scale farmers in developing countries and (2) analyzing how data management systems should be designed to enhance efficient decision-making and animal traceability from farm to fork. This study found that, still, a majority of small-scale farmers do not keep records leading to poor decision-making on the farm and policymaking. We also found that those who keep records do not store their data in electronic format, which again poses another challenge in data analysis. Moreover, this study found that the majority of traceability tools used by farmers in developing countries do not meet international standards based on tools they use for tracing animals; farmers were reported to use tools like branding and ear tagging, which provide very little information about the animal. Such tools lack the capability to keep track of useful information about an animal, e.g., information about feeding and animal health. In conclusion, this study recommended a better electronic system to be used at the farm level to facilitate data analysis, hence promoting informed decision-making and adherence to the international animal traceability standards.

Research into the diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of UTI has evolved over the past 10 years. The development of new imaging techniques and UTI screening tools has improved our diagnostic accuracy tremendously. Identifying who to treat is imperative as the increase in multi-drug-resistant organisms has emphasized the need for antibiotic stewardship. This review covers the contemporary management of children with UTI and the data-driven paradigm shifts that have been implemented into clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: With recent data illustrating the self-limiting nature and low prevalence of clinically significant vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), investigational imaging in children has become increasingly less frequent. Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonogram (CEVUS) has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool, as it can provide accurate detection of VUR without the need of radiation. The urinary and intestinal microbiomes are being investigated as potential therapeutic drug targets, as children with recurrent UTIs have significant alterations in bacterial proliferation. Use of adjunctive corticosteroids in children with pyelonephritis may decrease the risk of renal scarring and progressive renal insufficiency. The development of a vaccine against an antigen present on Escherichia coli may change the way we treat children with recurrent UTIs. SUMMARY: The American Academy of Pediatrics defines a UTI as the presence of at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen obtained by bladder catheterization with a dipstick urinalysis positive for leukocyte esterase (LE) or WBC present on urine microscopy. UTIs are more common in females, with uncircumcised males having the highest risk in the first year of life. E. coli is the most frequently cultured organism in UTI diagnoses and multi-drug-resistant strains are becoming more common. Diagnosis should be confirmed with an uncontaminated urine specimen, obtained from mid-stream collection, bladder catheterization, or suprapubic aspiration. Patients meeting criteria for imaging should undergo a renal and bladder ultrasound, with further investigational imaging based on results of ultrasound or clinical history. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial; however, evidence shows patients with high-grade VUR and bladder and bowel dysfunction retain the most benefit. Open surgical repair of reflux is the gold standard for patients who fail medical management with endoscopic approaches available for select populations.","output":"Contemporary Management of Urinary Tract Infections in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus that induces a fatal systemic disease mediated by an inappropriate immune response. Most previous vaccination attempts against FIPV were unsuccessful because IgG antibodies against the surface protein enhance the infection.

In our study, we report the construction of another poxvirus, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), as an expression vector for the FIPV M protein. In this vector, the M gene has been inserted downstream a strong early/late promoter, whereas the two previously described poxviruses expressed the M protein during their early stage only. The immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-M was evaluated in the murine model which revealed an effect of the vector on the Th1/Th2 balance. The vaccine was then tested in cats to evaluate its efficacy in an FIPV 79-1146 challenge.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, Angela Merkels communication differed from other Western political leaders who strongly relied on a war narrative. This paper focuses on the framing by the German Chancellor during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (MarchCJuly 2020). We examine Merkels crisis communication in three different public arenas: her public speeches, her press conference appearances and her weekly podcasts. Based on a qualitative content analysis, our study provides three relevant insights. First, it proves that the claim for solidarity C national as well as European solidarity - represents the crucial element of Merkels meaning-making narrative. Second, the study shows that both statements on the protection of public health and of economy strongly resonate in her communication, but that the prioritisation shifted over time. Finally, our analysis manifests how Merkels framing differs in the three communicative arenas. Additionally, our findings indicate that Merkel followed a modified leadership style during the COVID-19 crisis.

Questions have arisen concerning the main strategies to cope with this situation and the lessons to be learned from the pandemic. This conceptual paper aims to clarify these questions via sociological concepts. Regarding coping strategies used during the pandemic, there is a strong tendency for health policymakers to rely on expert knowledge rather than on evidence-based knowledge. This has caused the evidence-based healthcare community to respond to urgent demands for advice by rapidly processing new knowledge. Nonetheless, health policymakers still mainly rely on experts in making policy decisions. Our sociological analysis of this situation identified three lessons for coping with pandemic and non-pandemic health challenges: (1) the phenomenon of accelerating knowledge processing could be interpreted from the organizational innovation perspective as a shift from traditional mechanistic knowledge processing to more organic forms of knowledge processing. This can be described as an organic turn. (2) The return of experts is part of this organic turn and shows that experts provide both evidence-based knowledge as well as theoretical, experiential, and contextual knowledge. (3) Experts can use theory to expeditiously provide advice at times when there is limited evidence available and to provide complexity-reducing orientation for decisionmakers at times where knowledge production leads to an overload of knowledge; thus, evidence-based knowledge should be complemented by theory-based knowledge in a structured two-way interaction to obtain the most comprehensive and valid recommendations for health policy.","output":"The Organic Turn: Coping With Pandemic and Non-pandemic Challenges by Integrating Evidence-, Theory-, Experience-, and Context-Based Knowledge in Advising Health Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the release of 4% objective of fiscal educational expenditure to GDP in 2012, the Chinese governments at all levels have frequently formulated or changed education finance policy in light of the complex situation of Chinas economic development.

However, noninvasive approaches to measuring stiffness are limited. Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) of the brain is a relatively new noninvasive imaging method that provides quantitative measures of brain tissue stiffness. Herein, we aimed to use MRE to assess brain stiffness in hydrocephalus patients compared to healthy controls, and to assess its associations with ventricular size, as well as demographic, shunt-related and clinical outcome measures. METHODS MRE was collected at two imaging sites in 39 hydrocephalus patients and 33 healthy controls, along with demographic, shunt-related, and clinical outcome measures including headache and quality of life indices. Brain stiffness was quantified for whole brain, global white matter (WM), and lobar WM stiffness. Group differences in brain stiffness between patients and controls were compared using two-sample t-tests and multivariable linear regression to adjust for age, sex, and ventricular volume. Among patients, multivariable linear or logistic regression was used to assess which factors (age, sex, ventricular volume, age at first shunt, number of shunt revisions) were associated with brain stiffness and whether brain stiffness predicts clinical outcomes (quality of life, headache and depression). RESULTS Brain stiffness was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls, both unadjusted (p  0.002) and adjusted (p  0.03) for covariates. Among hydrocephalic patients, lower stiffness was associated with older age in temporal and parietal WM and whole brain (WB) (beta (SE): -7.6 (2.5), p = 0.004; -9.5 (2.2), p = 0.0002; -3.7 (1.8), p = 0.046), being female in global and frontal WM and WB (beta (SE): -75.6 (25.5), p = 0.01; -66.0 (32.4), p = 0.05; -73.2 (25.3), p = 0.01), larger ventricular volume in global, and occipital WM (beta (SE): -11.5 (3.4), p = 0.002; -18.9 (5.4), p = 0.0014). Lower brain stiffness also predicted worse quality of life and a higher likelihood of depression, controlling for all other factors. CONCLUSIONS Brain stiffness is reduced in hydrocephalus patients compared to healthy controls, and is associated with clinically-relevant functional outcome measures. MRE may emerge as a clinically-relevant biomarker to assess the neuropathological effects of hydrocephalus and shunting, and may be useful in evaluating the effects of therapeutic alternatives, or as a supplement, of shunting.","output":"MR Elastography demonstrates reduced white matter shear stiffness in early-onset hydrocephalus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the impact of lockdown amidst COVID-19 on undergraduate and postgraduate learners of various colleges and universities of West Bengal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 353 participants using a self-made questionnaire comparing the prevalence of low mood, apprehension, tension, and coping skills used and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. The data were analyzed to compare the mental health of male and female doctors. To identify predictors of mental health outcomes, a multivariate logistic regression was carried out. RESULTS: Both men and women were almost equally affected in terms of developing features of low mood, with easy physical and mental exhaustion. While the feeling of being isolated and irritability was slightly higher in females, both sexes were equally affected by the media. It was observed that the prevalence of smoking (tobacco/marijuana, etc.) had increased in both with slightly higher percentage in males as compared to females while there was a considerable increase in caffeine and alcohol consumption in males. The sleeping pattern and appetite were equally affected in both sexes. The sexual drive was also altered in both male and female residents, but the change was considerably more in males. The significant predictors of anxiety were age, depression, mental exhaustion, burden of increased quantity of work, and feeling of having no choice but to work due to obligation. CONCLUSION: Both male and female doctors working during the COVID-19 pandemic developed anxiety and depression.

Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in-silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (Deep-Vac-Pred). By combining the in-silico immunotherapeutic and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV- 2 spike protein sequence. We further use in-silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in-silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi- epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies.

This digital world can be programmed so that geosciences student takes data as if it were a field trip. The VR can save money, logistical problems and avoid accessing unsafe places. Besides, students can access places that would otherwise require a veritable expedition (hydroelectric projects in the Andes, remote highways, dams, tunnels in the Himalayas, among others.). At the beginning of the project in 2019, we designed some virtual rock mechanics classes to complement the face-to-face classes: In recent years, we have seen it increasingly difficult to organize field trips. We have designed virtualscenarios where students can obtain geomechanical data from tunnels, mines and rock slopes. We have used the CoSpaces commercial platform for this purpose. Within this virtual world, we place photographs, pop-up menus, videos of field and laboratory tests and clues for the student to search the data for himself in a quasi-real scenario. With all this data from the virtual scenario (as if they were in the field trip), students interpret in the cabinet and perform complex calculations (Hoek Brown, Barton-Bandis criteria, RMR, Q index, among others).

Methods: We surveyed users of a national SARS-CoV-2 testing company to assess the frequency and correlates of early treatment seeking behavior for a positive test result. We recruited adults (18 years or older) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at a large clinical laboratory. To be eligible, individuals had to have a positive test result within 7 days of enrollment. Surveys were anonymous and voluntary. We collected data on demographic characteristics, general health care access and utilization, awareness of treatment for COVID-19, treatment seeking behavior, and treatments received. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated on StataSE. Results: Participants were surveyed from 3-7 January 2022: among the 15,991 who viewed a survey request, 7,647 individuals were eligible and provided responses. The median age of a respondent was 42 years (interquartile range: 32 to 54), 68.9% of respondents were women, and respondents represented 33 different states, districts, and territories. Among respondents, 23.1% reported they had sought treatment or medical advice for their current COVID-19 diagnosis. Of those who were very aware of treatment for COVID-19, 31.0% sought treatment versus 16.7% who were unaware (p-value< 0.001).

Very recently its genomic RNA of 30 kb was decoded to be packaged with nucleocapsid (N) protein into phase separated condensates. Interestingly, viruses have no ability to generate ATP but host cells have very high ATP concentrations of 2C12 mM. A key question thus arises whether ATP modulates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the N protein. Here we discovered that ATP not only biphasically modulates LLPS of the viral N protein as we previously found on human FUS and TDP-43, but also dissolves the droplets induced by oligonucleic acid. Residue-specific NMR characterization showed ATP specifically binds the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the N protein with the average Kd of 3.3  0.4 mM. The ATP-RBD complex structure was constructed by NMR-derived constraints, in which ATP occupies a pocket within the positive-charged surface utilized for binding nucleic acids. Our study suggests that ATP appears to be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to prompt its life cycle by facilitating the uncoating, localizing and packing of its genomic RNA. Therefore the interactions of ATP with the viral RNA and N protein might represent promising targets for design of drugs and vaccines to terminate the pandemic.","output":"ATP biphasically modulates LLPS of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and specifically binds its RNA-binding domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify metallo--lactamases (MBLs) and AmpC -lactamases-producing Escherichia coli isolates obtained from hemodialysis (HD) patients with urinary tract infections (UTI).

MBLs and AmpC production were phenotypically detected by imipenem-ethylenediaminetetracetate and cefoxitin/boronic acid assays, respectively. The presence of MBLs and AmpC genes was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fosfomycin and ampicillin were the most and the least effective antibiotics against E. coli isolates, respectively. Moreover, 61.7% (29/47) of E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant with seven different antibiotypes. Antibiotype V (AMPCCIPCIMPCMEMCCPDCCROCCTXCGENCLEVCSXTCTOB) was the most prevalent profile. Besides, 24 (51.1%) isolates were simultaneously resistant to imipenem and meropenem. Phenotypic assay showed MBL production in 16 (66.7%) of the 24 carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolates. The distribution of MBL genes in carbapenem-resistant E. coli was as follows: bla(IMP) 18 (72%), bla(VIM) 7 (28%), and bla(NDM) 1 (4%).

Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists. Variations between the ascending (11 days, 281 chest CT, disease prevalence 37.0 %), the peak (18 days, 1167 chest CT, disease prevalence 64 %) and the descending phases (19 days, 746 chest CT, disease prevalence 32.2 %) were highest for PPV and NPV with a probability of difference >99.9 %, and smallest for accuracy and specificity with a probability of equivalence >98.8 %. CONCLUSION: In a homogenous cohort of 2194 consecutive chest CT performed over a 7-week epidemic wave, we observed significant variations of CT predictive values whereas CT specificity appeared marginally affected.","output":"Temporal variations in the diagnostic performance of chest CT for Covid-19 depending on disease prevalence: Experience from North-Eastern France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[ ]are there diet and lifestyle factors that contribute to the degree of immunopathology following the SARS-CoV-2 infection?

Using a randomization design, individual sessions were randomly assigned to feature practice with or without biofeedback, all delivered using the speech app Speech Therapist's App for /r/ Treatment. Progress was assessed using blinded listener ratings of word probes administered at baseline, posttreatment, and immediately before and after each treatment session. RESULTS All participants showed a clinically significant response to the overall treatment package, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to very large. One participant showed a significant advantage for biofeedback over nonbiofeedback treatment, although the order of treatment delivery poses a potential confound for interpretation in this case. CONCLUSIONS While larger scale studies are needed, these results suggest that app-based treatment for residual errors can be effective when delivered via telepractice.

The immediacy and magnitude of this crisis has resulted in government officials, practitioners and applied scholars turning to reflexive learning exercises to generate insights for managing the reverberating effects of this disease as well as the next inevitable pandemic. We contribute to both tasks by assessing COVID-19 as a super wicked problem denoted by four features we originally formulated to describe the climate crisis: time is running out, no central authority, those causing the problem also want to solve it, and policies irrationally discount the future (Levin et al. in Playing it forward: path dependency, progressive incrementalism, and the super wicked problem of global climate change, 2007; Levin et al. in Playing it forward: Path dependency, progressive incrementalism, and the \\"super wicked\\" problem of global climate change, 2009; Levin et al. in Policy Sci 45(2):123C152, 2012). Doing so leads us to identify three overarching imperatives critical for pandemic management. First, similar to requirements to address the climate crisis, policy makers must establish and maintain durable policy objectives. Second, in contrast to climate, management responses must always allow for swift changes in policy settings and calibrations given rapid and evolving knowledge about a particular diseases epidemiology. Third, analogous to, but with swifter effects than climate, wide-ranging global efforts, if well designed, will dramatically reduce domestic costs and resource requirements by curbing the spread of the disease and/or fostering relevant knowledge for managing containment and eradication. Accomplishing these tasks requires building the analytic capacity for engaging in reflexive anticipatory policy design exercises aimed at maintaining, or building, life-saving thermostatic institutions at the global and domestic levels.","output":"Managing pandemics as super wicked problems: lessons from, and for, COVID-19 and the climate crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination hesitancy is a threat to herd immunity. Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a key role in promoting Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in the general population. We therefore aimed to provide data on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance/hesitancy among German HCWs. For this exploratory, cross-sectional study, an online survey was conducted in February 2021. The survey included 54 items on demographics; previous vaccination behavior; trust in vaccines, physicians, the pharmaceutical industry and health politics; fear of adverse effects; assumptions regarding the consequences of COVID-19; knowledge about vaccines; and information seeking behavior. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and chi-square tests were performed. Four thousand five hundred surveys were analyzed. The overall vaccination acceptance was 91.7%. The age group 20 years showed the lowest vaccination acceptance. Factors associated with vaccination hesitancy were lack of trust in authorities and pharmaceutical companies. Attitudes among acquaintances were associated with vaccination hesitancy too. Participants with vaccination hesitancy more often obtained information about COVID-19 vaccines via messenger services or online video platforms and underperformed in the knowledge test. We found high acceptance amongst German HCWs.

Between real and imagined movements, a functional equivalence has been described regarding timing and brain activation. The primary study aim was to investigate the feasibility of MI training focusing on the autonomic function in healthy young people. Further aims were to evaluate participants MI abilities and compare preliminary effects of activating and relaxing MI on autonomic function and against controls. METHODS: A single-blinded randomised controlled pilot trial was performed. Participants were randomised to the activating MI (1), relaxing MI (2), or control (3) group. Following a MI familiarisation, they practiced home-based kinaesthetic MI for 17 minutes, 5 times/week for 2 weeks. Participants were called once for support. The primary outcome was the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlled trial using predefined criteria. Secondary outcomes were participants MI ability using the Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised, mental chronometry tests, hand laterality judgement and semi-structured interviews, autonomic function. RESULTS: A total of 35 participants completed the study. The feasibility of a larger study was confirmed, despite 35% attrition related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excellent MI capabilities were seen in participants, and significant correlations between MI ability measures. Interview results showed that participants accepted or liked both interventions. Seven major themes and insider recommendations for MI interventions emerged. No significant differences and negligible to medium effects were observed in MI ability or autonomic function between baseline and post-intervention measures or between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that neither activating nor relaxing MI seems to change autonomic function in healthy individuals. Further adequately powered studies are required to answer open questions remaining from this study. Future studies should investigate effects of different MI types over a longer period, to rule out habituation and assess autonomic function at several time points and simultaneously with MI.","output":"Feasibility of motor imagery and effects of activating and relaxing practice on autonomic functions in healthy young adults: A randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded, pilot trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D has been identified as an essential biomarker for various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was 0.001 ng/mL, which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%). Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.","output":"Bio-inspired Ag nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor for ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology arises today the viable to use an Educational Technology tool can be done in an internet-based system especially on the current pandemic crisis-COVID-19 we are facing The Researcher is thinking of integrating the existing Learning Management System (LMS) in an IoT SMARTPHONE Device, the reason behind this study is its accessibility and mobility wherever you are you for example while you are in your travel you can still access LMS via SMARTPHONE Device and then from there you can remind or send some information or data needed to be uploaded in the Systems accessible by the students in any learning platform IoT implementation influences on decreasing healthcare costs and improve handling outcomes of the COVID-19 infected patient Therefore, the study also attempted to explore, discuss, and highlight the overall applications of the IoT philosophy by offering a perspective roadmap to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, (Singh, Javaid, Haleem, & Suman 2020) Several useful technologies that IoT helps proper controlling and management of COVID-19 pandemic and these have been discussed in other studies as well These technologies have IoT could also help in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 and other health-related problems and symptoms (Javaid, et al 2020) The study aims to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program based on the Internet of Things (IoT) Application The Application can be implemented in real-time online communication using the cloud (San, et al 2020) This only means that the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency and as a global partnership is required in numerous quarters However, while effective protocols regarding the sharing of health data are given emphasized, on the other hand, specifically relating to health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from an expert perspective as exclusively benefiting a nations economy and its economic and political influence, (Allam & Jones 2020) Further research must be conceded out for the development of automated and effective IoT Application with Learning Management Systems in Smart Watches to provide early and timely detection of outbreaks of such diseases to reduce illness mortality and prevent worldwide spread, (Rahman, et al 2020)","output":"Using Learning Management Systems in an Internet of things (IOT) Smartphone Device Amidst COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The basic meaning of inactive lifestyle is doing sedentary activities.

To test for conservation of nsp5 structure-function determinants, we engineered chimeric betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) genomes encoding nsp5 proteases of human and bat alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Exchange of nsp5 proteases from HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, which share the same genogroup, genogroup 2a, with MHV, allowed for immediate viral recovery with efficient replication albeit with impaired fitness in direct competition with wild-type MHV. Introduction of MHV nsp5 temperature-sensitive mutations into chimeric HKU1 and OC43 nsp5 proteases resulted in clear differences in viability and temperature-sensitive phenotypes compared with MHV nsp5. These data indicate tight genetic linkage and coevolution between nsp5 protease and the genomic background and identify differences in intramolecular networks regulating nsp5 function.

Data Synthesis At the first visit during pregnancy, in all women we must exclude the presence of an \\"Overt diabetes\\". The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either one fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dL, or one random plasma glucose  200 mg/dL, or one glycated hemoglobin  6.5% When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable, if fasting plasma glucose is  92 mg/dL. In order to consider the impaired fasting glucose an acceptable surrogate for the diagnosis of GDM, the fasting glucose measurement should be performed within the recommended time windows for the risk level (high or medium risk). Conclusions The changes to the screening procedure for GDM reported below are specifically produced in response to the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, these recommended changes should cease in effect and replaced by current national guidelines when the healthcare authorities declare the end of this emergency.","output":"Italian recommendations for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic: Position statement AMD-SID, Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Executive Summary: \\"[1] Facebook is failing to keep people safe and informed during the pandemic [2] Global health misinformation spreading networks spanning at least five countries generated an estimated 3 8 billion views on Facebook in the last year [3] Health misinformation spreading websites at the heart of the networks peaked at an estimated 460 million views on Facebook in April 2020, just as the global pandemic was escalating around the world [4] Content from the top 10 websites spreading health misinformation had almost four times as many estimated views on Facebook as equivalent content from the websites of 10 leading health institutions, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \\"","output":"Facebook's Algorithm: A Major Threat to Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":". meist bakterielle (selten mykotische) Entzndung der Herzinnenhaut unter Beteiligung der Herzklappen; . oft Vorbestehen einer pr?disponierenden strukturellen Herzerkrankung, z.

In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review guided by intersectionality theory to deepen our understanding of the historical role that hegemonic masculinity plays in shaping ethnic minority women's experiences of sexual assault. Final sources included were analyzed using thematic analysis. On the basis of our analyses, we identified 4 themes: social order hierarchies, \\"othering\\" dynamics, economic labor divisions, and negative media/mass communication depiction. Our findings contribute to our understanding of these important histories that speak to the trauma of sexual violence inflicted upon the bodies of ethnic minority women, which we can incorporate into nursing education curricula. Incorporating this knowledge would equip nurses and allied health professionals with the necessary knowledge and skills that would enable them to help patients navigate multiple systems of oppression as they engage in help seeking following a sexual assault experience. This knowledge also acknowledges rather than dismisses the historically acceptable use of sexual violence against ethnic minority women.

Previous research reported the tolerance of crops to acid soil stress. However, the molecular response of woody plant to acid conditions remains largely unclear. Rhododendron L. is a widely distributed woody plant genus and prefers to grow in acidic soils. Herein, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed on R. protistum var. giganteum seedlings subjected to five pH treatments (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0), and their ecophysiological characteristics were determined for the identification of their molecular responses to acidic environments. Through pairwise comparison, 855 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with photosynthesis, cell wall, and phenylpropanoid metabolism were identified. Most of the DEGs related to photosynthesis and cell wall were up-regulated after pH 4.5 treatment. Results implied that the species improves its photosynthetic abilities and changes its cell wall characteristics to adapt to acidic conditions. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses showed that most of the hub genes were annotated to the biosynthetic pathways of ribosomal proteins and photosynthesis. Expression pattern analysis showed that genes encoding subunit ribosomal proteins decreased at pH 7.0 treatment, suggesting that pH 7.0 treatment led to cell injury in the seedlings. The species regulates protein synthesis in response to high pH stress (pH 7.0). The present study revealed the molecular response mechanism of woody plant R. protistum var. giganteum to acid environments.

This study examines current trends in students pursuing a dual doctor of medicine (MD)-master of public health (MPH) degree (MD-MPH) in the United States. METHODS We conducted an extensive literature review of existing MD-MPH databases to determine characteristics (eg, sex, race/ethnicity, MPH area of study) of this student cohort in 2019. We examined a trend in the MD community to pursue an MPH career, adding additional public health and health care policy training to the MD workforce. We conducted targeted telephone interviews with 20 admissions personnel and faculty at schools offering MD-MPH degrees in the United States with the highest number of matriculants and graduates. Interviews focused on curricula trends in medical schools that offer an MD-MPH degree. RESULTS No literature describes the US MD-MPH cohort, and available MD-MPH databases are limited and incomplete. We found a 434% increase in the number of students pursuing an MD-MPH degree from 2010 to 2018. The rate of growth was greater than the increase in either the number of medical students (16%) or the number of MPH students (65%) alone. Moreover, MD-MPH students as a percentage of total MPH students more than tripled, from 1.1% in 2010 to 3.6% in 2018.

Lipoprotein profiling in heart failure (HF) is incompletely characterized. We aimed to describe the lipoprotein profile in patients with chronic HF compared with a matched control population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from May 2006 to April 2014 and included ambulatory patients with chronic HF. Lipid concentrations and the size of main lipoprotein fractions (high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and very low-density lipoprotein) and the particle concentration of their 3 subfractions (large, medium and small) were assessed using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: The 429 included patients with chronic HF were compared with 428 matched controls. Patients with chronic HF had lower total cholesterol and lower mean LDL (1115 vs 1352 nmol/L; P<.001) and HDL (25.7 vs 27.9mol/L; P <.001) particle concentrations, with this last difference being mediated by a significantly lower concentration of the small subfraction of HDL (15.2 vs 18.6mol/L; P <.001). Mean very low-density lipoprotein, LDL, and HDL particle size was significantly higher in patients with HF vs controls. All HDL-related differences from controls persisted after adjustment for New York Heart Association functional class or body mass index. We found strong negative correlations of known cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and interleukin-1 receptor-like 1) with total and small LDL and HDL fractions and HDL particle size.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective echocardiographic evaluation of 48 patients (mean age 58  13 years, 69% male) hospitalized 6  1 month earlier for a laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Thirty-two (66.6%) had pre-existing cardiovascular risks factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidaemia), and three patients (6.2%) had a known prior myocardial infarction. Sixteen patients (33.3%) experienced myocardial injury during the index COVID-19 hospitalization as identified by a rise in cardiac troponin levels. Six months later, 60.4% of patients still reported clinical symptoms including exercise dyspnoea for 56%. Echocardiographic measurements under resting conditions were not different between patients with versus without myocardial injury during the acute COVID-19 phase.

HCW who died during the period of March 2020 to July 2021 across Indonesia were identified on Pusara Digital, a community web based digital cemetery database dedicated to HCW. We calculated mortality rates and death risk ratio among HCWs and the general population. Qualitative methods explored concerns regarding mortality among HCWs. The analysis suggests that at least 1,545 HCWs died during the study period. The death of males and females HCWs were almost equally distributed (51% vs. 49%). Most were medical doctors and specialists (535, 35%), nurses (428, 28%), and midwives (359, 23%). Deaths most frequently occurred in the age group of 40 to 59 years old with the median age of 50 years (IQR: 39 to 59). At least 322 (21%) deaths occurred with pre-existing conditions, including 45 who were pregnant.

Provincial HCW mortality rates ranged from 0.136 (West Sulawesi) to 5.32 HCW deaths per 1000 HCWs (East Java). HCW had a significantly higher mortality rate than the general population (RR = 4.92, 95% CI 4.67 to 5.17).

These systems abandon the conventional microscope design, which requires expensive lenses and large space to magnify images, and instead utilizes microfluidic flow to deliver specimens across array(s) of micrometer-size apertures defined on a metal-coated CMOS sensor to generate direct projection images. The first system utilizes a gravity-driven microfluidic flow for sample scanning and is suited for imaging elongate objects, such as Caenorhabditis elegans; and the second system employs an electrokinetic drive for flow control and is suited for imaging cells and other spherical/ellipsoidal objects. As a demonstration of the OFM for bioscience research, we show that the prototypes can be used to perform automated phenotype characterization of different Caenorhabditis elegans mutant strains, and to image spores and single cellular entities. The optofluidic microscope design, readily fabricable with existing semiconductor and microfluidic technologies, offers low-cost and highly compact imaging solutions.

We outline our deployment of a virtual tabletop simulation (TTS) method in primary care (PC) clinics across Alberta, Canada. We summarise the quality and safety improvements from this method and report end users' perspectives on key elements. Methods: Our virtual TTS used teleconferencing software alongside digital whiteboards to walk clinic stakeholders through patient scenarios. Participants reviewed and rehearsed their workflows and care practices. The goal was for staff to take ownership over gaps and codesigned solutions. After simulation sessions, follow-up interviews were conducted to collect feedback. Results: These sessions helped PC staff identify and codesign solutions for clinical hazards and threats. These included the flow of patients through clinics, communications, redesignation of physical spaces, and adaptation of guidance for cleaning and personal protective equipment use. End users reported sessions provided neutral spaces to discuss practice changes and built confidence in delivering safe care during the pandemic. Discussion: TTS has not been extensively deployed to improve clinical practice in outpatient environments. We show how virtual TTS can bridge gaps between knowledge and practice by offering a guided space to rehearse clinical changes. We show that virtual TTS can be used in multiple contexts to help identify hazards, improve safety and build confidence in professional teams adapting to rapid changes in both policies and practices. While our sessions were conducted in Alberta, our results suggest this method may be deployed in other contexts, including low-resource settings. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

However, with the advent of COVID-19, sports industry has been influenced significantly and the industry scale is decreased considerably. In this situation, how to accurately predict the sports industry scale in terms of production and consumption is becoming a practical and valuable task, because the whole worlds economy is not growing stably and users demand to sport goods is fluctuating sharply. However, three challenges are often existing in the sports industry scale prediction. First of all, there are so many kinds of sport goods that it is hard to quickly predict their future production or consumption scales accurately. Second, for a certain sport commodity, its production or consumption scale is often related to time especially in the COVID-19 environment. Third, sports industry scale data often contain some privacy, which probably disables data stakeholders to disclose their data. In view of these three challenges, a novel sports industry scale prediction approach (named SISP) is proposed for healthcare, which is basically according to time series analysis. Through SISP approach, we can quickly and accurately predict the future production or consumption scales of sport goods, in a privacy-aware way.

Here, we analyzed serum collected upon COVID-19 admission (t1), 48 hours (t2), and seven days later (t3) using Olink proteomics and correlated to clinical, demographics, and therapeutic data. Older age positively correlated with decorin, pleiotrophin, and TNFRS21 but inversely correlated with chemokine (both C-C and C-X-C type) ligands, monocyte attractant proteins (MCP) and TNFRS14. The burden of pre-existing conditions was positively correlated with MCP-4, CAIX, TWEAK, TNFRS12A, and PD-L2 levels. Individuals with COVID-19 demonstrated increased expression of several chemokines, most notably from the C-C and C-X-C family, as well as MCP-1 and MCP-3 early in the course of the disease. Similarly, deceased individuals had elevated MCP-1 and MCP-3 as well as Gal-9 serum levels. LAMP3, GZMB, and LAG3 at admission correlated with mortality. Only CX3CL13 and MCP-4 correlated positively with APACHE score and length of stay, while decorin, MUC-16 and TNFRSF21 with being admitted to the ICU. We also identified several organ-failure-specific immunological markers, including those for respiratory (IL-18, IL-15, Gal-9) or kidney failure (CD28, VEGF).

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is said to be up to 95% effective against severe disease or death. We were able to demonstrate that an additional 9.8% of COVID-19 vaccine doses could theoretically be given if the residual vaccine within the reconstituted Pfizer vials after six doses are extracted were used. This could be achieved by aseptically combining this excess vaccine from multiple vials to achieve full 0.3ml doses. MethodsAn observational study was conducted in April, 2021, at a mass vaccine site run by a community volunteer organization on Bainbridge Island, Washington. We measured the amount of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that was left in 172 vials after six doses had been withdrawn per Centers for Disease Control (CDC) protocol. ResultsA total of 30.68 ml of leftover vaccine was measured and discarded as medical waste. 1,036 doses were given from these vials. An extra 102 doses theoretically could have been given using the residual vaccine in the vials. This would have resulted in 9.8% additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine without requiring new vials. ConclusionThe ability to combine solution from reconstituted Pfizer vaccine vials to minimize waste and obtain additional doses of vaccine could result in an increase in the number of individuals that could be vaccinated worldwide without additional cost.

In this study, a new ergonomic pistol handle concept, realized as a prototype, and two disposable ring handles were investigated according to ergonomic properties set by new European standards. METHODS In this study, 25 volunteers performed four practical tasks to evaluate the ergonomics of the handles used in standard operating procedures (e.g., measuring a suture and cutting to length, precise maneuvering and targeting, and dissection of a gallbladder). Moreover, 20 participants underwent electromyography (EMG) tests to measure the muscle strain they experienced while carrying out the basic functions (grasp, rotate, and maneuver) in the x, y, and z axes. The data measured included the number of errors, the time required for task completion, perception of pressure areas, and EMG data. The values for usability in the test were effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Surveys relating to the subjective rating were completed after each task for each of the three handles tested. RESULTS Each handle except the new prototype caused pressure areas and pain. Extreme differences in muscle strain could not be observed for any of the three handles. Experienced surgeons worked more quickly with the prototype when measuring and cutting a suture (approximately 20%) and during precise maneuvering and targeting (approximately 20%). On the other hand, they completed the dissection task faster with the handle manufactured by Ethicon. Fewer errors were made with the prototype in dissection of the gallbladder. In contrast to the handles available on the market, the prototype was always rated as positive by the volunteers in the subjective surveys. CONCLUSIONS None of the handles could fulfil all of the requirements with top scores. Each handle had its advantages and disadvantages. In contrast to the ring handles, the volunteers could fulfil most of the tasks more efficiently using the prototype handle without any remarkable pressure areas, cramps, or pain.","output":"Ergonomics of disposable handles for minimally invasive surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most higher education institutions have embraced emergency remote teaching (ERT) as a response to school and university closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

MEK6 engages in cell growth, such as inflammation and apoptosis, as one of the MAPK signaling pathways. The MEK6 gene was found to be related to RMR, a gene associated with obesity. Because only a few studies have investigated the correlation between MEK6 and obesity or the relevant mechanisms, we conducted an experiment using a Tg(MEK6) model with MEK6 overexpression with non-Tg and chow diet as the control to determine changes in lipid metabolism in plasma, liver, and adipose tissue after a 15-week high-fat diet (HFD). MEK6 overexpression in the Tg(MEK6) model significantly increased body weight and plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. p38 activity declined in the liver and adipose tissues and lowered lipolysis, oxidation, and thermogenesis levels, contributing to decreased energy consumption. In the liver, lipid formation and accumulation increased, and in adipose, adipogenesis and hypertrophy increased. The adiponectin/leptin ratio significantly declined in plasma and adipose tissue of the Tg(MEK6) group following MEK6 expression and the HFD, indicating the role of MEK6 expression in adipokine regulation. Plasma and bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) of the Tg(MEK6) group increased MEK6 expression-dependent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines but decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, further exacerbating the results exhibited by the diet-induced obesity group.

Although telehealth has been studied for its impact on patients, payors, and practitioners, its educational impact is largely unstudied. To better understand the trainee experience and perception of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a survey of the membership of the American College of Surgeons Resident and Associate Society (RAS). Methods: An anonymous survey was sent to members of RAS. Descriptive analysis was used to report experiences and perceptions. Chi-square analysis was used to compare cohorts with and without exposure to telehealth. Results: Of the 465 RAS respondents, 292 (62.8%) reported knowledge of telehealth technologies at their institutions. The majority of these respondents experienced a decrease in in-person clinic volume (94.4%) and an associated increase in virtual clinic volume (95.7%) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trainee integration into telehealth workflows increased drastically from prepandemic levels (11% vs. 54.5%, p < 0.001). Likelihood of trainee exposure to telehealth was associated with university-based training programs or larger program size. Trainees demonstrated a desire for more integration and development of curricula. Conclusions: These data serve as the first description of surgical trainee experience with, and opinion of, telehealth.

We distinguish two groups: adolescents who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder and the general population of adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: An increase in the number of mental health-related difficulties in adolescents has already been reported in previous health crises. Accordingly, the perceived well-being of teenagers declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents with mental disorders were significantly more affected by the lockdown than those in the general population. SUMMARY: The effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental health of adolescents has been heterogeneous. The first pandemic wave was essentially associated with an increase of internalizing symptoms in adolescents, particularly anxiety, depression and eating disorders. The impact on externalizing symptoms was less clear, and seem to concern mostly adolescents with pre-existing behavioral disorders. During the second and later waves of the pandemic, an upsurge of suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescents have been reported in many countries.","output":"Emotional and Behavioral Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multifaceted autoimmune inflammatory disease with a wide range of clinical presentations resulting from its effect on multiple organ systems. We report a case of SLE associated with autoimmune pancreatitis. Methods: In this study, we present a patient diagnosed as having SLE who developed acute auto-immune pancreatitis. Results: This is a 36-year-old woman, with lupus diagnosed since 2009. Initially, the manifestations of her disease were dermatological and articular. Then appeared the renal involvement with a lupus nephropathy class IV at the renal biopsy (PBR). She was previously treated with the NIH protocol then oral prednisolone with improvement in her symptoms. She continued these medications but was lost to follow-up since 2016 and presented after 6 years with pigmented skin lesions on her upper and lower limbs, abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and an altered general condition. In biology, the patient presented a functional acute kidney failure, an elevated amylasemia (30 times normal), an elevated lipasemia (6 times normal), a normocytic normochromic hemolytic anemia with positive direct coombs test, lymphopenia, a positive immunological assessment (AAN, anti DNA AC, anti Sm, anti SSA, anti RNP), a low C3, a low C4. The patient presented a lupus flare with a SLEDAI score of 6 points: moderate lupus activity. Ultrasound confirmed a large abundance of ascites. Ascites fluid puncture showed an exudate with hyperleukocytosis with predominantly PNN and no germ on direct examination nor on culture.The infectious origin of the pancreatitis was eliminated (CMV, tuberculosis, covid19), as well as the tumoral origin (negative tumor markers, abdominal CT scan showed a swollen pancreas in its caudal portion with loss of physiological lobulations and normal spontaneous density.Necrosis flows difficult to individualize. In addition, no deep neoplastic focus). The autoimmune origin of the pancreatitis due to its lupus attack was retained. She was put on corticosteroids (500mg intravenously for 3 days) then relayed by oral route, albumin infusion, evacuation puncture. The subsequent evolution was marked by the progressive normalization of the pancreatic balance and the slower disappearance of the ascites. Conclusions: Acute pancreatitis is an unusual manifestation of SLE and it should be suspected in any SLE patient with these similar symptoms. In many cases, this complication has been attributed to the drugs administered. In our case, a favorable course of pancreatitis with corticosteroids adds further evidence to the idea that lupus-related pancreatitis is not a side effect of corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, treatment with these medications improves the prognosis.

Bulbar muscle functions are markedly affected resulting in depressed cough reflex, swallowing, and speech. Thus, mechanical ventilation, supportive feeding, and critical care are essential for the survival of patients in a myasthenic crisis. Numerous precipitating factors of this condition are well known and include infections, various medications, pregnancy, and childbirth. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at a considerably higher risk of developing a debilitating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to the associated immunosuppression resulting from long-term corticosteroid use, which makes vaccination of such individuals necessary. However, the relationship between an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and the COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. In this paper, we report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who developed a myasthenic crisis after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) vaccine (AstraZeneca batch number 210157; AstraZeneca plc, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Despite the administration of aggressive and intensive treatment over a period of 29-day hospitalization, the myasthenic crisis could not be reversed and the patient ultimately deteriorated and succumbed from multiple myocardial infarction events and organ failures. While it is still uncommon, evidence associating the effects of the vaccine to the development of a crisis is mounting; therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to promptly identify clinical features that suggest an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis in order to intervene at the earliest possible stage for a more favorable outcome. The myasthenia gravis patient should be informed about the possible association between COVID-19 vaccination and the development of a myasthenic crisis.","output":"An Interesting Case of Fatal Myasthenic Crisis Probably Induced by the COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue viruses (DENV) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as 19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.","output":"Development and Characterization of a Reverse Genetic System for Studying Dengue Virus Serotype 3 Strain Variation and Neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A group of 47 children with coeliac disease, born between 1973 and 1978 in the Swedish county of V?stmanland, participated in a controlled questionnaire study.

This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market to investigate whether vulnerable groups become more vulnerable due to an interaction between the socio-economic structure and physical risk. METHODS: This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market by considering unemployment status, job status, working hours, reason for unemployment and underemployment status. In particular, the study investigates whether the U-shaped curve becomes a J-shaped curve due to the interaction between medical vulnerability and labor market vulnerability after an outbreak, assuming that the relative vulnerability in the labor market by age shows a U curve with peaks for the young group and middle aged and old aged groups using the Economically Active Population Survey. We use the difference in difference approach and also conduct a falsification check and robustness check. RESULTS: The results suggest that older workers faced a higher possibility of unemployment after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. In particular, they experienced higher involuntary unemployment and underemployment status as well as decreased working hours. It was confirmed that the relative vulnerability of the labor market for older workers was higher than for the other age groups after the epidemic outbreak due to the double whammy of vulnerability in the medical and labor market. The vulnerability in the young group partially increased compared to the 30s and 40s age groups due to their relative vulnerability in the labor market despite being healthy. We find that assuming the relative vulnerability in the existing labor market shows a U shape with age increase, the U-shaped curve became J-shaped after the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Disasters like epidemics can occur unexpectedly and affect certain groups more than other. Therefore, medical protection should be enhanced for groups vulnerable to disease and economic measures are also required for the protection of their livelihoods in the labor market to prevent unemployment stemming from inequality.","output":"The impact of epidemics on labor market: identifying victims of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Korean labor market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is certainly too early to take stock of Professor Raoult's intuitions, and moreover, that is not the aim of this short article.

In order to safely care for patients new processes, such as a plan for the airway management of a patient with COVID-19, must be implemented and disseminated in a rapid fashion. The use of in-situ simulation has been used to assist in latent problem identification as part of a Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Additionally, simulation is an effective means for training teams to perform high-risk procedures before engaging in the actual procedure. This educational advance seeks to use and study in-situ simulation as a means to rapidly implement a process for airway management in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Using an airway algorithm developed by the authors, we designed an in-situ simulation scenario to train physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists in best practices for airway management of patients with COVID-19. Physician participants were surveyed using a five-point Likert scale with regard to their comfort level with various aspects of the airway algorithm both before and after the simulation in a retrospective fashion. Additionally, we obtained feedback from all participants and used it to refine the airway algorithm. RESULTS: Over a two-week period, 93 physicians participated in the simulation. We received 81 responses to the survey (87%), which showed that the average level of comfort with personal protective equipment procedures increased significantly from 2.94 (95% confidence interval, 2.71-3.17) to 4.36 (4.24-4.48), a difference of 1.42 (1.20-1.63, p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in average comfort level in understanding the physician role with scores increasing from 3.51 (3.26-3.77) to 4.55 (2.71-3.17), a difference of 1.04 (0.82-1.25, p < 0.001). There was also increased comfort in performing procedural tasks such as intubation, from 3.08 (2.80-3.35) to 4.38 (4.23-4.52) after the simulation, a difference of 1.30 points (1.06-1.54, p < 0.001).

Zoologica Scripta, 33, 223C237. The morphology of the venom apparatus intima in representatives of 38 genera of the problematic braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae and other cyclostome braconids was investigated and a preliminary phylogenetic analysis for the group was performed with the information obtained. Despite the limited number of characters, the data suggest several relationships at various taxonomic levels. The venom apparatus in the Clinocentrini and the Stiropiini is relatively unmodified and similar to that found in other genera previously placed within a broader concept of the Rogadinae (e.g. genera of Lysitermini, Pentatermini, Tetratermini, Hormiini) and also to that of the Betylobraconinae. The presence of a cone of filaments located inside the secondary venom duct near to its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct is proposed as a synapomorphy for the tribe Rogadini to the exclusion of Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and Yeliconini. Other features of the secondary venom duct and its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct support a number of relationships between the genera of the Rogadini and also within the large genus Aleiodes. A clade containing 15 Rogadini genera (Bathoteca, Bathotecoides, Bulborogas, Canalirogas, Colastomion, Conspinaria, Cystomastacoides, Macrostomion, Megarhogas, Myocron, Pholichora, Rectivena, Rogas, Spinaria and Triraphis) is supported by the presence of a thickened and short secondary venom duct, whereas the different members of Aleiodes (excluding members of the subgenus Heterogamus) and Cordylorhogas are distinguished by having a recessed secondary venom duct with well\\\\defined and numerous internal filaments. New World Rogas species exhibit a unique venom apparatus and may not be closely related to the Old World ones. Features of the venom apparatus of the enigmatic genus Telengaia and the exothecine genera Shawiana and Colastes suggest that the Telengainae and Exothecinae are both closely related to the Braconinae, Gnamptodontinae, and possibly to the Opiinae and Alysiinae. An unsculptured venom reservoir was found in one specimen of the type species of Avga, A. choaspes, which is consistent with it occupying either a very basal position within the cyclostome braconids or belonging to a recently recognized Gondwanan clade that also includes the Aphidiinae.","output":"Comparative morphology of the venom apparatus in the braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae (Insecta, Hymenoptera, Braconidae) and related taxa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would require aggressive contact tracing and isolation of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Models in published literature have suggested that digital rather than manual contact tracing might be more effective in containing the pandemic. This article seeks to examine the forms of contact tracing that Singapore, a highly dense city-state, adopts with a focus on new innovations including the use of digital technology. METHODS: An exploratory literature search in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reviewing technological approaches and responses to COVID-19 was performed. Information published by national agencies was also analysed to ascertain how technology was utilised in contact tracing. RESULTS: Contact tracing in Singapore is overseen by the Ministry of Health (MOH). COVID-19 cases are interviewed on their whereabouts during a backward and forward activity mapping process to identify close contacts. Extensive contact tracing even involving the police and serological tools have helped to establish links between cases and closed several local clusters. Examination of patient's digital footprint has helped in contact tracing. Other digital technology introduced includes SafeEntry and TraceTogether. SafeEntry is a cloud-based visitor registration system while TraceTogether is a mobile phone application which operates by exchanging anonymised identifiers between nearby phones via Bluetooth connection. CONCLUSION: Digital contact tracing is likely to expand and continue to complement human-based contact tracing for the current and future pandemics. However, at this juncture, it is not ready to replace the manual and meticulous work that only Singapore contact tracers can achieve.","output":"The experience of contact tracing in Singapore in the control of COVID-19: highlighting the use of digital technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Social distancing policies aimed to limit Covid-19 across the UK were gradually relaxed between May and August 2020, as peak incidences passed. Population density is an important driver of national incidence rates; however peak incidences in rural regions may lag national figures by several weeks. We aimed to forecast the timing of peak Covid-19 mortality rate in rural North Wales. Methods: Covid-19 related mortality data up to 7/5/2020 were obtained from Public Health Wales and the UK Government. Sigmoidal growth functions were fitted by non-linear least squares and model averaging used to extrapolate mortality to 24/8/2020. The dates of peak mortality incidences for North Wales, Wales and the UK; and the percentage of predicted mortality at 24/8/2020 were calculated. Results: The peak daily death rates in Wales and the UK were estimated to have occurred on the 14/04/2020 and 15/04/2020, respectively. For North Wales, this occurred on the 07/05/2020, corresponding to the date of analysis. The number of deaths reported in North Wales on 07/05/2020 represents 33% of the number predicted to occur by 24/08/2020, compared with 74 and 62% for Wales and the UK, respectively. Conclusion: Policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas-principally rural in nature-where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas.

PTB is a risk factor for COVID-19, both in terms of severity and mortality, regardless of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. However, there is less information available on COVID-19 associated with PTB in point of view incidence and mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a high burden TB region. This systematic review served to provide data synthesis of available evidence on COVID-19/PTB incidence and case fatality rates, and mortality rate found in clinical and post-mortem COVID-19/PTB diagnostics in SSA. Methods We conducted a systematic electronic search in the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Medrxix and COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease databases for studies including COVID-19 associated with PTB in sub-Saharan Africa. The main outcomes were the proportion of people with COVID-19 associated to current /or previous PTB and the case fatality associated to COVID-19/PTB. The combination method was based on methodological similarities in the included random effect model studies using Prometa 3 software. We further undertook sensitivity analysis and meta-regression. Results From the 548 references extracted by the literature search, 25 studies were selected and included in the meta-analysis with a total of 191, 250 COVID-19 infected patients and 11, 452 COVID-19 deaths. The pooled COVID-19/PTB incidence was 2% [1%-3%] and mortality of 10% [4%-20%]. The pooled estimates for case fatality rate among COVID-19/PTB were 6% [3%-11%] for clinical PTB diagnostic and 26% [14%-48%] for post-mortem PTB diagnostic.

Conclusion As a summary, the incidence of TB associated with COVID-19 and case fatality rates are higher in SSA. However, COVID-19 associated to TB may be underreported in the studies conducted in SSA as the post-mortem TB diagnostic was higher. Large-scale cohort studies that adequately clear tool on previous and/or current TB diagnostic tools are required to confirmed COVID-19/TB incidence and case fatality in SSA.","output":"The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 related TB infection in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are an important cause of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

METHODS: We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute-care hospital and the United States. RESULTS: For an acute-care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% interpercentile range [IPR], 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR, 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases to a range of 22 (95% IPR, 10-43) to 4,445 (95% IPR, 1,975-8,684) if each N95 is used for 5 patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR, 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR, 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5%-90% of the population is exposed (single-use). This number ranges from 17.4 million (95% IPR, 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR, 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for 5 encounters.

This vector is then used to cluster nodes in the same community. While a robust method, it can be expensive to compute the Fiedler vector exactly. In this paper we examine the types of errors that can be tolerated using spectral methods while still recovering the communities.

The audits consisted of 20C30 minutes observations in each ward RESULTS: Among 57 participants overall, 42 (73.7%) were nurses, 8 (14.0%) clinicians, and 5 (8.8%) therapists. Twenty-one (36.8%) of the participants had knowledge regarding the minimum time needed to practice HH using alcohol based hand rub, 14 (24.6%) knew that hand washing and hand rubbing should be performed in sequence. The combined knowledge score for each individual ranged from 0% to 94.1% with a mean of 50.1% (SD=20.1, Cl 95% 44.7- 55.4%). Hand hygiene compliance significantly varied by clinical instructors type; nurses (42.7%) and therapists (38.0%) had the highest adherence and clinicians had the lowest 33.7% (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Clinical teachers in this study demonstrated knowledge gaps and poor practices related to HH. Since they serve as role models for future generations of healthcare workers, clinical teachers must recognize the importance of HH in preventing hospital-acquired infections, including when and how HH should be performed while following recommended practices.

It is important to diagnose the disease in the early stages. Current methods detect the disease with low specificity. Examining the expression of genes responsible for disease and their epigenetic regulators are good tools in this regard. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective case-control study, 40 Iranian patients with cancer, 40 Iranian patients with prostate hyperplasia, and 40 control samples were examined. After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method. RESULTS A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency. The significant decrease of GSTP1 expression in patients in comparison to the healthy controls and the elevated expression levels of the studied epigenetic regulators in PCA and BPH samples indicate the impact of the regulators on GSTP1 expression activity. CONCLUSION This study showed that the measurement of combined GSTP1 and its epigenetic regulators' expression could be used as suitable genetic markers for the detection and separation of healthy individuals from prostatic patient groups in the Iranian population. However, a similar study in a larger population of case and control could help us to distinguish between normal, benign, and malignant conditions.","output":"Investigation of GSTP1 and epigenetic regulators expression pattern in a population of Iranian patient with prostate cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we characterize the interaction between the glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of Puumala virus (PUUV; genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae). The interaction was initially established with native proteins by co-immunoprecipitating PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein with the glycoprotein complex. Mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the N protein has multiple binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Gn and is also able to bind to the predicted CT of Gc. The importance of Gn- and Gc-CTs to the recognition of RNP was further verified in pull-down assays using soluble peptides with binding capacity to both recombinant N protein and the RNPs of PUUV and Tula virus. Additionally, the N protein of PUUV was demonstrated to interact with peptides of Gn and Gc from a variety of hantavirus species, suggesting a conserved RNP-recognition mechanism within the genus. Based on these and our previous results, we suggest that the complete hetero-oligomeric (Gn-Gc)(4) spike complex of hantaviruses mediates the packaging of RNP into virions.","output":"Cytoplasmic tails of hantavirus glycoproteins interact with the nucleocapsid protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Dexmedetomidine has been a preferred sedative for patients undergoing regional anaesthesia and is mostly administered via conventional zero-order infusion. Recently, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of dexmedetomidine has been published, but no external validation has been reported in clinical trials. We aimed to administer target-controlled infusion (TCI) of dexmedetomidine at the effect-site concentration (Ce) to patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia and investigate the relationship between dexmedetomidine Ce and the sedative effects. METHODS Forty-five patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery received spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. After confirmation of sensory block level, we initiated effect-site TCI of dexmedetomidine using Colin's model and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale and bispectral index (BIS) with each stepwise increase in the dexmedetomidine Ce. We used a non-linear mixed-effects model to determine the PD relationships between the dexmedetomidine Ce and sedation level. RESULTS The dexmedetomidine Ce associated with 50% probability (Ce50 ) of the MOAA/S scale 4, 3 and 2 was 0.57, 0.89 and 1.19 ng/mL, respectively. Mean dexmedetomidine Ce when BIS decreased 70 was 0.99  0.15 ng/mL. As dexmedetomidine Ce increased, the MOAA/S scale decreased significantly (correlation coefficient [r] = -.832, P < .0001). BIS decreased significantly with increasing dexmedetomidine Ce (r = -.811, P < .0001) and decreasing MOAA/S scale (r = .838, P < .0001). The most common side effects were hypertension (26.67%) and bradycardia (20%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION We applied effect-site TCI of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for the first time.

The introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines has reduced the incidence of rotavirus disease in many countries. To explore the possibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding sequences for NSP3 and FLAG-tagged portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A 2A translational element was used to drive separate expression of NSP3 and the S product. rSA11 viruses were recovered that encoded the S-protein S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended receptor-binding domain (ExRBD), and S2 core (CR) domain (rSA11/NSP3-fS1, -fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR, respectively). Generation of rSA11/fS1 required a foreign-sequence insertion of 2.2-kbp, the largest such insertion yet made into the rotavirus genome. Based on isopycnic centrifugation, rSA11 containing S sequences were denser than wildtype virus, confirming the capacity of the rotavirus to accommodate larger genomes. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11/-fNTD, -fRBD, -fExRBD, and -fCR viruses expressed S products of expected size, with fExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 failed to express its expected 80-kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (e.g., NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR) with sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.","output":"Rotavirus as an Expression Platform of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An accurate and efficient image classification algorithm used in the COVID-19 detection for lung tomography can be of great help for doctors working in places without advance equipments.

Human and animal studies strongly indicate that early life stress leads to lasting changes to cognition and psychiatric outcomes, but less is known about how chronic adolescent stress may alter brain function across the lifespan. Methods: The current study examines the effects of chronic social instability stress (SIS) on male and female mice from 4 to 11 weeks of age. SIS mice (n=52) experienced twice weekly cage changes, preventing the formation of stable social hierarchies, while control mice (n=48) remained with their original cage mates. Mice were subsequently assessed throughout adulthood for changes in behavior associated with anxiety, affect, aggression, motivation, and recognition memory. At 66 weeks of age, levels hippocampal mRNA expression of genes associated with human early life stress were also compared (CRHR1, CRHR2, FKBP5, SLCA4). Results: Mice exposed to SIS showed decreased novel object recognition (p=0.002) and responded more during the progressive ratio task (p=0.033). At 66 weeks, SIS mice had increased hippocampal FKBP5 (p=0.03) and CRHR2 (p=0.005) expression relative to controls;furthermore, these measures negatively correlated with novel object recognition (FKBP: p=0.007;CRHR2: p=0.04). Conclusions: Chronic adolescent social instability stress led to persistent memory deficits and increased hedonic seeking in adulthood, possibly due to hippocampal damage resultant from lasting alterations to the stress cascade. Future studies will determine the cellular, molecular and circuit-level changes underlying these effects.

METHODS: At the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC), a tertiary care hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, a two-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted in which mobile health augmented cardiac rehabilitation (MCard) was developed and implemented on post-ACS patients from January 2019 until March 2021. The trial conforms to the CONSORT statement 2010. The post-ACS patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to an intervention group (received MCard; counselling, empowering with self-monitoring devices, short text messages, in addition to standard post-ACS care) or control group (standard post-ACS care). HRQoL was assessed by generic Short Form-12 and MacNew quality of life myocardial infarction (QLMI) tools. Participants were followed for 24 weeks with data collection and analysis at three time points (baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks). RESULTS: At baseline, 160 patients (80 in each group; mean age 52.668.46 years; 126 male, 78.75%) were recruited, of which 121(75.62%) continued and were analysed at 12-weeks and 119(74.37%) at 24-weeks. The mean SF-12 physical component score significantly improved in the MCard group at 12 weeks follow-up (48.93 vs control 43.87, p<.001) and 24 weeks (53.52 vs 46.82 p<.001). The mean SF-12 mental component scores also improved significantly in the MCard group at 12 weeks follow-up (44.84 vs control 41.40, p<.001) and 24 weeks follow-up (48.95 vs 40.12, p<.001). At 12-and 24-week follow-up, all domains of MacNew QLMI (social, emotional, physical and global) were also statistically significant (p<.001) improved in the MCard group, unlike the control group. CONCLUSION: MCard is an effective and acceptable intervention at improving all domains of HRQoL. There was an improvement in physical, mental, social, emotional and global domains among the MCard group in comparison to the control group.

Despite rigorous treatment involving chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate of high-risk disease remains < 40%, highlighting the need for improved therapy. Since neuroblastoma cells exhibit aberrant metabolism, we determined whether their sensitivity to radiotherapy could be enhanced by drugs affecting cancer cell metabolism. METHODS Using a panel of neuroblastoma and glioma cells, we determined the radiosensitising effects of inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DG) and mitochondrial function (metformin). Mechanisms underlying radiosensitisation were determined by metabolomic and bioenergetic profiling, flow cytometry and live cell imaging and by evaluating different treatment schedules. RESULTS The radiosensitising effects of 2-DG were greatly enhanced by combination with the antidiabetic biguanide, metformin. Metabolomic analysis and cellular bioenergetic profiling revealed this combination to elicit severe disruption of key glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolites, causing significant reductions in ATP generation and enhancing radiosensitivity. Combination treatment induced G2/M arrest that persisted for at least 24 h post-irradiation, promoting apoptotic cell death in a large proportion of cells. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that the radiosensitising effect of 2-DG was significantly enhanced by its combination with metformin. This clearly demonstrates that dual metabolic targeting has potential to improve clinical outcomes in children with high-risk neuroblastoma by overcoming radioresistance.","output":"Inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration promotes radiosensitisation of neuroblastoma and glioma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the emerging knowledge and understanding of novel coronavirus infection, dentists must be capable of resuming their practice with necessary precautions in near future; hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices along with felt challenges by the dentists concerning practicing dentistry during pandemic in India.

To stop the deadly spread of the virus, many countries, including Indonesia, have applied the 'Large-scale Social Restriction' (LSSR) policy. Numerous studies have reported positive impacts of air quality due to this policy. However, in Indonesia, data on the impacts of LSSR on air quality are still sparse. Therefore, this study aims to analyze changes in air quality at before and during the LSSR periods in the South Sumatera Province, Indonesia using the satellite-based observations of particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The results showed that the concentrations of the measured pollutants markedly declined during the LSSR period from the highest was SO2 (98.90%) and followed by NO2 (34.79%), CO (12.70%) and PM10 (11.54%), respectively. The emissions from biomass burning activities were expected as a major source of air pollutant during the LSSR. Furthermore, we found a positive association between PM10 and the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in the study area (r = 0.514, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, this study concluded that the implementation of LSSR could reduce air pollutants concentration in the study area while a higher PM10 exposure could increase the risk of death from COVID-19.

Since mitochondrial activity also depends on their structure, it is important to elucidate the interrelationship between the activity and structure of mitochondria. However, the mechanism by which mitochondrial activity affects the structure of cristae, the folded structure of the inner membrane, is not well understood. In this study, the effect of the mitochondrial activity on the cristae structure was investigated by examining the structural rigidity of cristae. Taking advantage of the fact that unfolding of cristae induces mitochondrial swelling, we investigated the relationship between mitochondrial activity and the susceptibility to swelling. The swelling of individual isolated mitochondria exposed to a hypotonic solution was observed with an optical microscope. The presence of respiratory substrates (malate and glutamate) increased the percentage of mitochondria that underwent swelling, and the further addition of rotenone or KCN (inhibitors of proton pumps) reversed the increase. In the absence of respiratory substrates, acidification of the buffer surrounding the mitochondria also increased the percentage of swollen mitochondria. These observations suggest that acidification of the outer surface of inner membranes, especially intracristal space, by proton translocation from the matrix to the intracristal space, decreases the structural rigidity of the cristae. This interpretation was verified by the observation that ADP or CCCP, which induces proton re-entry to the matrix, suppressed the mitochondrial swelling in the presence of respiratory substrates. The addition of CCCP to the cells induced a morphological change in mitochondria from an initial elongated structure to a largely curved structure at pH 7.4, but there were no morphological changes when the pH of the cytosol dropped to 6.2. These results suggest that a low pH in the intracristal space may be helpful in maintaining the elongated structure of mitochondria. The present study shows that proton pumping by the electron transfer chain is the mechanism underlying mitochondrial morphology and the flexibility of cristae structure.","output":"Effects of proton pumping on the structural rigidity of cristae in mitochondria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease.

The 252 samples were collected from multi-site NHS trusts and analysed for SARS-CoV-2 serology. Assay performance was evaluated between these three platforms and ROC curves were used to redefine the Abbott threshold. Concordance between Abbott and TBS was 66%. Any discrepant results were analysed using Roche, which showed 100% concordance with TBS. Analysis conducted in HCWs within 58 days post-PCR result demonstrated 100% sensitivity for both Abbott and Roche. Longitudinal analysis for >100 days post-PCR led to sensitivity of 77.2% and 100% for Abbott and Roche, respectively. A redefined Abbott threshold (0.64) increased sensitivity to 90%, producing results comparable to TBS and Roche. The manufacturers threshold set by Abbott contributes to lower sensitivity and elevated false-negative occurrences. Abbott performance improved upon re-optimisation of the cut-off threshold.

Polymyxin, an ancient polypeptide antibiotic, has been given renewed attention over recent years, resulting in resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin, but its resistance mechanism is not completely clear. Thus, it is important to study its resistance mechanisms. In this study, an in vitro induced polymyxin-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium in the laboratory were constructed to investigate the mechanism of resistance of Salmonella to polymyxin. Gradual induction of Salmonella typhimurium ATCC13311 (AT) by concentration increment was used to screen for a highly polymyxin-resistant strain AT-P128. The broth dilution technique was used to compare the sensitivity of the two strains to different antimicrobial drugs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then identified by whole genome sequencing, and differences in gene expression between the two strains were compared by transcriptome sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, for the first time, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system was used to construct gene deletion mutants in Salmonella to knock out the phoP gene of AT-P128. The results showed that strain AT-P128 was significantly more resistant to amoxicillin, ceftiofur, ampicillin, fluphenazine, and chloramphenicol and significantly less resistant to sulfamethoxazole than the parental strain AT. The growth curve results showed no significant change in the growth rate between AT-P128 and AT. Motility and biofilm formation assays showed a significant decrease in AT-P128. Additionally, the WGS results showed that AT-P128 had mutations in 9 genes involving 14 SNPs. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results showed increased expression of phoPQ. The loss of the phoP gene decreased AT-P128&#916;phoP resistance to polymyxin by 32-fold. These results suggested that polymyxin resistance affected the biology, genome components, and gene expression levels of Salmonella and that the PhoPQ two-component system played a key role in polymyxin resistance in Salmonella, providing insights into the diversity and complexity of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella.","output":"Mechanisms of polymyxin resistance induced by Salmonella typhimurium in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular biology has revolutionized medicine by increasing our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of disease and the ability to assess genetic risk.

This study aimed to assess the knowledge of Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents regarding medical management of schizophrenia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, as the findings could help to refine the training curriculum for residency training. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was used. Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents pursuing their residency in Singapore were recruited from November 2019 to June 2020. The survey questionnaire consisted of questions which assessed the knowledge regarding medical management of schizophrenia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic data; T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the differences between groups; and multiple regression analyses to assess the factors associated with Psychiatry residents knowledge of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. RESULTS: Fifty-seven out of 70 (81.4%) Psychiatry residents and 58 out of 61 (95.1%) Family Medicine residents participated in the study. The majority of Psychiatry residents encountered patients with hypertension (93.0%), diabetes mellitus (87.7%) and dyslipidemia (91.2%) on a daily to weekly basis. Psychiatry residents had higher scores on questions about schizophrenia versus Family Medicine residents (mean 50.70 versus 43.28, p < 0.001). However, Psychiatry residents scored lower on questions about hypertension (mean 33.86 versus 40.98, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (mean 45.68 versus 49.79, p = 0.005) and dyslipidemia (mean 37.04 versus 44.31, p < 0.001). Receiving undergraduate medical education locally, compared to receiving it overseas, was associated with better knowledge of hypertension (beta = 0.515, p = 0.009) and dyslipidemia (beta = 0.559, p = 0.005); while younger age (26C30 versus > 35 and 31C35 versus > 35) was associated with better knowledge of hypertension (beta = 1.361, p = 0.002 and beta = 1.225, p = 0.003).

We compared the timing and the level of recruitment before and after the loss of a hindlimb was simulated. Both the intensity and the timing of the activity changed significantly in the m. vastus lateralis of the remaining hindlimb, consistent with this limb bearing a greater proportion of the body weight as well as with previously reported kinematic changes. In accordance with the greater body weight supported by the forelimbs, the m. triceps brachii showed first and foremost an increased level of excitation. The very asymmetrical changes in the timing and the level of activity in the m. longissimus dorsi reflects the highly asymmetrical functional requirements imposed on the trunk and the pelvis when one hindlimb is no longer involved in the production of locomotor work while the other hindlimb partially compensates the loss.

A standardized extract of Asparagus officinalis stem (EAS) is a unique functional food that elicits anti-photoaging effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling in hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet B-exposed skin fibroblasts. To elucidate its potential in preventing excessive inflammation in COVID-19, we examined the effects of EAS on pro-inflammatory responses in S1-stimulated macrophages. Murine peritoneal exudate macrophages were co-treated with EAS and S1. Concentrations and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Expression and phosphorylation levels of signaling proteins were analyzed using western blotting and fluorescence immunomicroscopy. EAS significantly attenuated S1-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 in a concentration-dependent manner without reducing cell viability. EAS also markedly suppressed the S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1. However, among the TLR4 signaling proteins, EAS did not affect the degradation of inhibitor B, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-B p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase p54 subunit after S1 exposure. In contrast, EAS significantly suppressed S1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt. Attenuation of S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1 by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126 was greater than that by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, and the effects were potentiated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors. These results suggest that EAS attenuates S1-induced IL-6 and IL-1 production by suppressing p44/42 MAPK and Akt signaling in macrophages. Therefore, EAS may be beneficial in regulating excessive inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Standardized Extract of Asparagus officinalis Stem Attenuates SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced IL-6 and IL-1 Production by Suppressing p44/42 MAPK and Akt Phosphorylation in Murine Primary Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance for Canadas 2021C2022 seasonal influenza epidemic began in epidemiological week 35 (the week starting August 29, 2021) during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global public health emergency. In the 2021C2022 surveillance season to date, there has been a return of persistent sporadic influenza activity, and the first influenza-associated hospitalizations since mid-2020 have been reported. However, as of week 52 (week ending 01/01/2022) activity has remained sporadic, and no influenza-confirmed outbreaks or epidemic activity have been detected. There has been a delay or absence in several traditional seasonal influenza milestones, including the declared start of the influenza season, marked by a threshold of 5% positivity, which historically has occurred on average in week 47. The 429 sporadic detections reported in Canada to date have occurred in 31 regions across seven provinces/territories. Nearly half (n=155/335, 46.3%) of reported cases have been in the paediatric (younger than 19 years) population. Three-quarters of the cases were influenza A detections (n=323/429, 75.3%). Of the subtyped influenza A detections, A(H3N2) predominated (n=83/86, 96.5%). Of the 12 viruses characterized by the National Microbiology Laboratory, 11 were seasonal strains. Among the seasonal strains characterized, only one was antigenically similar to the strains recommended for the 2021C2022 Northern Hemisphere vaccine, though all were sensitive to the antivirals, oseltamivir and zanamivir. Until very recently, seasonal influenza epidemics had not been reported since March 2020. Evidence on the re-emergence of seasonal influenza strains in Canada following the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic shows that influenza A(H3N2) and B epidemics ceased through the 2009C2010 season and second wave of A(H1N1)pdm09, but then re-emerged in subsequent seasons to predominate causing epidemics of higher intensity than in the pre-pandemic seasons. When and where seasonal influenza epidemic activity resumes cannot be predicted, but model-based estimates and historical post-pandemic patterns of intensified epidemics warrant continued vigilance through the usual season and for out-of-season re-emergence. In addition, ongoing population preparedness measures, such as annual influenza vaccination to mitigate the intensity and burden of future seasonal influenza epidemic waves, should continue.","output":"National FluWatch mid-season report, 2021C2022: Sporadic influenza activity returns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical microbiologists have a new and unique opportunity to increase our value to health care by broadening how we think about disease processes and asking ourselves what we can do to help resolve a disease, assist in tracking a cause, or even predict an outbreak before it occurs. Human health, animal health (both wildlife and domestic animals), and environmental health are forever bound together. The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology. We can become familiar with the zoonotic diseases and recognize the etiologic agents associated with wild and domestic animals and apply that knowledge to our diagnostic skills. As we further understand the big picture of One Health, we can ask strategic questions that can lead us to provide further technical assistance to facilitate earlier interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes and ultimately healthier populations. In human medicine, we generally work with one species of animal. Veterinarians work with all the rest. It is time to communicate with and learn from our veterinary clinical microbiology colleagues and begin to understand the critical nature of the human, animal, and environment interface.

Resource allocation in times of scarcity requires transparent, ethical frameworks to optimize decision making and reduce health care worker and patient distress. The complexity of allocating dialysis resources for both patients receiving acute and maintenance dialysis has not previously been addressed. Using a rapid, collaborative, and iterative process, BC Renal, a provincial network in Canada, engaged patients, doctors, ethicists, administrators, and nurses to develop a framework for addressing system capacity, communication challenges, and allocation decisions. The guiding ethical principles that underpin this framework are (1) maximizing benefits, (2) treating people fairly, (3) prioritizing the worst-off individuals, and (4) procedural justice. Algorithms to support resource allocation and triage of patients were tested using simulations, and the final framework was reviewed and endorsed by members of the provincial nephrology community. The unique aspects of this allocation framework are the consideration of two diverse patient groups who require dialysis (acute and maintenance), and the application of two allocation criteria (urgency and prognosis) to each group in a sequential matrix. We acknowledge the context of the Canadian health care system, and a universal payer in which this framework was developed.

The aim of the present case-series study is to describe clinical and pharmacological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients, focusing on ADRs, particularly those related to DDIs. We evaluated all reports of COVID-19 medication-related ADRs collected within the COVID-19 Units of Careggi University Hospital, Florence (Italy), between January 1st and 31st May 2020. Information regarding COVID-19 medications, patients demographic and clinical characteristics, concomitant drugs, ADRs description and outcome, were collected. Each case was evaluated for the causality assessment and to identify the presence of DDIs. During the study period, 23 Caucasian patients (56.5% males, mean age 76.1 years) experienced one or more ADRs. The majority of them were exposed to polypharmacy and 17.4% presented comorbidities. ADRs were referred to cardiovascular, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. The most frequently reported preferred term was QT prolongation (mean QT interval 496.1 ms).

Starting January 21, 2020, at Taihe Hospital in Shiyan City, Hubei Province, 2944 medical staff members were recruited and allocated into a low-risk group or a high-risk group according to whether they were directly exposed to the coronavirus. Participants in the low-risk group received rhIFN- nasal drops (2-3 drops/nostril/time, 4 times/day) for 28 days; those in the high-risk group received rhIFN- nasal drops combined with thymosin-1 (1.6 mg, hypodermic injection, once a week). The primary outcome was new-onset COVID-19 over 28 days. The secondary outcome was new-onset fever or respiratory symptoms but with negative pulmonary images. The results were compared with the number of new cases in medical staff in the same areas of Hubei Province (including Wuhan) during the same period. Adverse reactions to interferon nasal drops were also observed. Results Among the 2944 subjects in our study, 2415 were included in the low-risk group, including 997 doctors and 1418 nurses with average ages of 37.38 and 33.56 years, respectively; 529 were included in the high-risk group, including 122 doctors and 407 nurses with average ages of 35.24 and 32.16 years, respectively. The 28-day incidence of COVID-19 was zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. The 28-day incidence of new-onset clinical symptoms with negative images for pneumonia was also zero in both the high- and low-risk groups. As controls, a total of 2035 medical personnel with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from the same area (Hubei Province) was observed between January 21 to February 23, 2020. There were no serious adverse effects in the 2944 subjects treated during the intervention period.

Materials and methods Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT.
