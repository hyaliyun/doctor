Their everlasting usage results in impacts on the microbial community composition and causes well-known collateral damage to the functioning of microbial communities. Nevertheless, the impact of different antibiotic properties on aquatic microbial communities have so far only poorly been disentangled. Here we characterized the environmental risk of 50 main kinds of antibiotics from 9 classes at a concentration of 10 g/L for aquatic bacterial communities via metadata analysis combined with machine learning. Metadata analysis showed that the alpha diversity of the bacterial community increased only after treatment with aminoglycoside and -lactam antibiotics, while its structure was changed by almost all tested antibiotics. The antibiotic treatment also disturbed the functions of the bacterial community, especially with regard to metabolic pathways, including amino acids, cofactors, vitamins, xenobiotics and carbohydrate metabolism. The critical characteristics (atom stereocenter count, number of hydrogen atoms in the antibiotic, and the adipose water coefficient) of antibiotics affecting the composition of the bacterial community in aquatic habitats were screened by machine learning. The key characteristics of antibiotics affecting the function bacterial communities were the number of hydrogen atoms, molecular weight and complexity. In summary, by developing machine learning models and by performing metadata analysis, this study provides the relationship between the properties of antibiotics and their adverse impacts on aquatic microbial communities from a macro perspective.

As the marine system is the final sink for MP, there is an urgent need to develop methods for the monitoring of synthetic particles in different marine compartments and sample matrices. Extensive evaluations are hindered by time and costs associated with to conventional MP spectroscopic analyses. The potential of near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) has been recently evaluated. However, NIR-HSI has been poorly studied so far, limitedly to the detection of large particles (>300 m), and its capability for direct characterization of MP in real marine matrices has not been considered yet. In the present study, a rapid near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) method, coupled with a customised normalised difference image (NDI) strategy for data processing, is presented and used to detect MP down to 50 m in environmental matrices. The proposed method is largely automated, without the need for extensive data processing, and enabled a successful identification of different polymers, both in surface water and mussel soft tissue samples, as well as on real field samples with environmentally occurring MP. NIR-HSI is applied directly on filters, without the need for particles pre-sorting or multiple sample purifications, avoiding time consuming procedures, airborne contaminations, particle degradation and loss. Thanks to the time and cost effectiveness, a large-scale implementation of this method would enable to extensively monitor the MP presence in natural environments for assessing the ecological risk related to MP contamination.","output":"An effective strategy for the monitoring of microplastics in complex aquatic matrices: Exploiting the potential of near infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic depression is a common disorder in secondary care.

METHOD This article describes the evidence, rational and the most important techniques of CBASP. RESULTS In the United States CBASP has proven to be effective in one trial. As a result of these findings, CBASP is recommended in the Dutch treatment guidelines as an evidence-based treatment option for chronic depression. However, the findings have not yet been replicated and little is known about possible ways of implementing CBASP in the Netherlands.

Here, we investigated the protective effect and mechanism of hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-derived exosomes on acute tubular injury.

By using exosome miRNA sequencing, we identified miR-20a-5p was abundant and was a key mechanism for the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury as up-regulation of miR-20a-5p enhanced but down-regulation of miR-20a-5p inhibited the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury under hypoxia conditions. Further study in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (IRI-AKI) also confirmed this notion as pre-treating mice with the miR-20a-5p agomir 48 h prior to AKI induction was capable of inhibiting IRI-AKI by lowering serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and attenuating the severity of tubular necrosis, F4/80(+) macrophages infiltration and vascular rarefaction. Mechanistically, the protective effect of miR-20a-5p on acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with inhibition of TECs mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

This clinical observation indicates the resistance of the body and its cells to androgens like testosterone. At the molecular level, this hormone resistance is caused by hemizygous loss of function mutations in the X-chromosomal androgen receptor (AR) gene. Partial forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) show different degrees of virilisation largely depending on the remaining activity of the AR. Nevertheless, the phenotypic outcome can be variable even in presence of the same mutation and in the same kindred indicating the presence of further influencing factors. Importantly, the majority of clinically diagnosed PAIS individuals do not bear a mutation in their AR gene. A recent assay using the androgen regulated gene apolipoprotein D as biomarker is able to detect androgen insensitivity on the cellular level even in absence of an AR gene mutation. Using this assay a class of AIS without an AR-gene mutation was defined as AIS type II and suggests that unidentified cofactors of the AR are responsible for the PAIS phenotype.

Using laboratory data, NorthShore University Health System created the Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to track activities affected by SARS-CoV-2 across the organization. Operational leaders used data insights and predictions from Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team to redeploy critical care resources across the hospital system, and real-time data were used daily to make adjustments to staffing and supply decisions. Geographical data were used to triage patients to other hospitals in our system when COVID-19 detected pavilions were at capacity. Additionally, one of the consequences of COVID-19 was the inability for patients to receive elective care leading to extended periods of pain and uncertainty about a disease or treatment. After shutting down elective surgeries beginning in March of 2020, NorthShore University Health System set a recovery goal to achieve 80% of our historical volumes by October 1, 2020. Using the Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team, our operational and clinical teams were able to achieve 89% of our historical volumes a month ahead of schedule, allowing rapid recovery of surgical volume and financial stability. The Data Coronavirus Analytics Research Team also was used to demonstrate that the accelerated recovery period had no negative impact with regard to iatrogenic COVID-19 infection and did not result in increased deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolisms, or cerebrovascular accident. These achievements demonstrate how a coordinated and transparent data-driven effort that was built upon a robust laboratory testing capability was essential to the operational response and recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. ?

The direct contact between the tonometer and the eye may contribute to the risk of cross infection, especially of viral particles, from one patient to another. A systematic review was undertaken to address the likelihood of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and prion diseases transmission through the use of tonometers. Additionally, a comparison of the current tonometer disinfection methods is provided to assist with identifying which technique effectively reduces the risk of disease transmission. An electronic literature search was conducted using the following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Biosis Previews, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Dissertation indexes were also searched, and these included: Dissertations and Abstracts, and Dissertations and Abstracts - UK/Ireland. Additionally, the Clinicaltrials.gov trial registry was searched to identify any other relevant literature. Two independent reviewers critically appraised the articles retrieved through the literature search. In total, 11 unique studies were deemed relevant for this systematic review. The available evidence demonstrated that the use of tonometers contributes to the transmission of these infectious diseases in vitro. The results also demonstrated variability in determining the most effective tonometer sterilization technique against these infectious diseases in vitro. There was limited evidence available regarding the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and prion diseases through the use of tonometers. Additionally, due to the variability regarding the most effective sterilization techniques, it is difficult to identify which sterilization technique is most effective or adequately effective against these infectious diseases.

Antibodies, by opsonizing parasites, can promote phagocytosis and killing of T. cruzi by cells expressing FcR, on the mandatory condition that such cells are sufficiently activated in an inflammatory context. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism well described in viral infections, by which antibodies enhance entry of infectious agents into host cells by exploiting the phagocytic FcR pathway. Previously reported Chagas disease studies highlighted a severe reduction of the maternal-fetal/neonatal inflammatory context in parasite-transmitting pregnant women and their congenitally infected newborns. Otherwise, experimental observations brought to light ADE of T. cruzi infection (involving FcR) in mouse pups displaying maternally transferred antibodies, out of an inflammatory context.

The discovery of nanobodies has emerged as a successful new biologics in treating mucosal infectious disease as nanobodies can recognize conserved epitopes on hypervariable pathogens. In this study, we performed large screens using immunized llamas and a na?ve nanobody yeast display library against adhesins of colonization factors. Cross-protective nanobodies were selected with in vitro activities inhibiting mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRHA) against all eleven major pathogenic ETEC strains. Oral administration of nanobodies led to significant reduction of bacterial colonization in animals challenged with multiple ETEC strains. Structural analysis revealed novel conserved epitopes as critical structural features for pan-ETEC vaccine design. Two of the lead nanobodies, 2R215 and 1D7, were further engineered as trimer or fused with human IgA Fc-fragments as fusionbodies. Oral administration of the trimers or fusionbodies protected mice from infection at a much lower dose compared to the monomeric format. Importantly, fusionbodies prevented infection as a pre-treatment when administrated 2 hours before ETEC challenge to the animals. Together, our study provides the first proof of concept that oral administration of a single nanobody could confer broad protection against major pathogenic ETEC strains.

Aim: The aim of this research study was to explore the HLE for foundation phase learners by analysing data from an intervention that aspired to support organised learning at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: This research study was conducted telephonically with families from 11 schools (10 in the Waterberg district, Limpopo and one in Soweto, Gauteng). Methods: Qualitative data (recorded phone interviews) were collected from caregivers and learners from 17 households. The interview recordings were transcribed and translated into English. The constant comparative method of data analysis was used to analyse interview transcripts. Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis: (1) challenges of learning at home, (2) perceived benefits of learning at home and (3) the desire to continue with the programme even after schools re-opened. The data showed that having access to learning material facilitated learning at home. Additionally, caregivers noted benefits to learners from engaging in learning activities. However, there were also challenges in facilitating learning at home. These include caregivers not following the learning guidelines provided. Conclusion: Caregivers appreciated having access to learning material and were willing to facilitate learning at home. However, the challenges they faced resulted in them not executing the programme effectively.

In spite of their popularity, minibuses are generally inefficient, disorganized and have low service quality. In an attempt to assess service quality of the service, a modified SERVPERF tool was developed. Differences in perceptions of service quality between male and female respondents were also assessed, and the attractiveness of certain technological features as possible remedies to service quality issues were determined. Using an online Google forms version of the modified SERVPERF, responses from nearly one thousand commuters were collected. The link to the questionnaire was dispersed via social media (Whatsapp and Telegram) since the data was collected during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ghana. Following a factor reduction, the most important service quality factors determined to affect trotro users were (i) Reliability of the service, (ii) Variability in cost and (iii) Responsiveness. Respondents also identified technologies that could help them (a) book, (b) report driver misbehavior, (c) make safe e-payments and (d) track the location of trotros, as most likely to improve their trotro service quality. The findings suggest that some mobility as a service features could have possible benefit for the trotro.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scoring systems at admission for the prediction of mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included 140 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings at admission were used to calculate SOFA and qSOFA against the in-hospital outcomes (survival or death) that were ascertained from the medical records. The predictive accuracy of both scoring systems was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve for SOFA in predicting mortality was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.826C0.955), which was higher than that of qSOFA (0.742, 95% CI 0.657C0.816).

Despite establishment of a novel national paid sick leave policy, anecdotal evidence suggests that many U.S. food system workers encountered barriers to staying home when ill. Methods: Using quantitative and free-text analyses from a national, cross-sectional, online survey deployed from July to October 2020 among 2,535 respondents, we explored workplace and non-workplace factors associated with U.S. food system workers' intentions to attend work while ill (i.e. presenteeism intentions) during the first four to six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Overall, 8.8% of workers surveyed reported intentions to attend work while ill. Both quantitative data and free-text responses suggest that aspects of workplace culture influenced workers' decisions to attend work while ill. Workers reporting a high workplace safety climate score had half the odds of reporting presenteeism intentions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37, 0.75) relative to those reporting low scores. Workers described cultural barriers, including retaliation and penalties, that reduced paid sick leave access.

The immune system and the vaginal microbiome represent the modifiable and important risk factors in HPV-induced carcinogenesis. HPV infection significantly increases vaginal microbiome diversity, leading to gradual increases in the abundance of anaerobic bacteria and consequently the severity of cervical dysplasia. Delineation of the exact composition of the vaginal microbiome and immune environment before HPV acquisition, during persistent/progressive infections and after clearance, provides insights into the complex mechanisms of cervical carcinogenesis. It gives hints regarding the prediction of malignant potential. Relative high HPV prevalence in the general population is a challenge for modern and personalized diagnostics and therapeutic guidelines. Identifying the dominant microbial biomarkers of high-grade and low-grade dysplasia could help us to triage the patients with marked chances of lesion regression or progression.

We investigated cross-sectional associations between problematic social media use and depressive outcomes among Chinese college students with potential mediation by perceived social support, social media violence, and loneliness. Thereafter, we evaluated the effectiveness of a one-month group counseling intervention in reducing depressive symptoms related to social media addiction. Methods: Depressive symptoms, social media addiction, perceived social support, social media violence, and loneliness were self-reported among 21,000 college students in Shaanxi province, China. A randomized controlled trial was designed based on the results of the observational study and Satir Transformational Systemic Therapy (STST) among 60 college students assigned to intervention (N = 30) or control/no treatment (N = 30). Self-administered surveys were completed at baseline (T1), at the end of the 1-month intervention (T2), and at 2-month follow-up post-intervention (T3). Results: After controlling for relevant covariates, more problematic social media use was associated with more depressive symptoms ( = 0.18, p < 0.001) and depression (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.075, 1.092). Multiple mediation analyses found that perceived social support, social media violence, and loneliness significantly mediated associations between problematic social media use and depressive symptoms (model fit: RMSEA = 0.065, GFI = 0.984, CFI = 0.982). Bootstrapping revealed significant indirect effects of problematic social media use on depressive symptoms through the mediators named above (0.143, 95% CI: 0.133, 0.156). The subsequently informed intervention significantly reduced depressive symptoms at T2 (mean difference: ?12.70, 95% CI: ?16.64, ?8.76, p < 0.001) and at T3 (mean difference: ?8.70, 95% CI: ?12.60, ?4.80, p < 0.001), as well as levels of social media addiction, perceived social support, social media violence, and loneliness.

A total of 1,491 respondents (76.3% female, Mage = 41.23) lived together full-time with their partner at the time. Our findings indicate that during the lockdown, women experienced more relationship stress than men because of conflict and diverging attitudes within their relationship. Furthermore, both men and women experienced more stress during the lockdown than before because they felt restricted in their relationship. Lastly, women reported significantly more perceived relationship stress during the pandemic lockdown compared to before because of conflicts they experienced within their relationship. Our findings provide important information for policymakers and health-care professionals to help couples who endure relationship hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown or in possibly similar situations in future crises.

The reference standard for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test applied on respiratory tract specimens. Despite of lower specificity, chest computed tomography (CT), as reported in manifold scientific studies, showed high sensitivity, therefore it may help in the early detection, management and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia usually showed on chest CT some typical features, such as: Bilateral ground glass opacities characterized by multilobe involvement with posterior and peripheral distribution; parenchymal consolidations with or without air bronchogram; interlobular septal thickening; crazy paving pattern, represented by interlobular and intralobular septal thickening surrounded by ground-glass opacities; subsegmental pulmonary vessels enlargement (> 3 mm). Halo sign, reversed halo sign, cavitation and pleural or pericardial effusion represent some of atypical findings of COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS: In total, 44 children aged 0 to 24 months with febrile UTI and 35 age- and sex-matched controls with fever from other causes were enrolled in the study. ELISA was performed to determine the level of YKL-40 in urine collected from each child. RESULTS: The ratio of urinary YKL-40 to creatinine (Cr) was higher in the children with a UTI than in the controls (P<0.001). The area under the ROC curve for detecting UTI was 0.88 for the urinary YKL-40/Cr ratio, 0.86 for pyuria, and 0.71 for positive nitrite on urinalysis. We applied a cut-off value of 125.23 pg/mg to urinary YKL-40/Cr for detecting UTI. Eight of nine children in the control group with pyuria had urinary YKL-40/Cr levels lower than 125.23 pg/mg, and the one child in the UTI group without pyuria or positive nitrite had a urinary YKL-40/Cr level greater than 125.23 pg/mg.

However, several studies have indicated that influenza C virus causes severe acute respiratory illness and pneumonia in all ages. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a study to identify influenza C virus among young children in South Korea.Study design. From October 2013 to September 2016, 973 young children with influenzalike illness (ILI) were enrolled at three university hospitals. We tested nasopharyngeal samples for 16 types of respiratory viruses. Among the tested samples, 564 were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Except for the samples where 16 types of respiratory viruses were found, 409 negative samples were examined for the presence of influenza C virus, using a matrix gene specific primer set. RESULTS: Among 409 nasopharyngeal samples, five influenza C viruses were detected. The manifestation of influenza C virus infection in young children was observed acute respiratory illness, such as fever, rhinorrhea, and cough, but no pneumonia or severe respiratory illness. Nucleotide sequencing was conducted and a phylogenetic tree was generated. We found that C/Sao Paulo/387/82-like lineage viruses circulated in South Korea, and the fully sequenced virus (C/Seoul/APD462/2015) was closely related to C/Victoria/2/2012 and C/Tokyo/4/2014 strains.

Within the international project COVID19-NMR, we distribute the spectroscopic analysis of the viral proteins and RNA. Here, we report NMR chemical shift assignments for the protein Nsp3b, a domain of Nsp3. The 217-kDa large Nsp3 protein contains multiple structurally independent, yet functionally related domains including the viral papain-like protease and Nsp3b, a macrodomain (MD). In general, the MDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were suggested to play a key role in viral replication by modulating the immune response of the host. The MDs are structurally conserved. They most likely remove ADP-ribose, a common posttranslational modification, from protein side chains. This de-ADP ribosylating function has potentially evolved to protect the virus from the anti-viral ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), which in turn are triggered by pathogen-associated sensing of the host immune system. This renders the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3b a highly relevant drug target in the viral replication process. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone resonance assignment ((1)H, (13)C, (15)N) of the putative Nsp3b MD in its apo form and in complex with ADP-ribose. Furthermore, we derive the secondary structure of Nsp3b in solution. In addition, (15)N-relaxation data suggest an ordered, rigid core of the MD structure. These data will provide a basis for NMR investigations targeted at obtaining small-molecule inhibitors interfering with the catalytic activity of Nsp3b.","output":"(1)H, (13)C, and (15)N backbone chemical shift assignments of the apo and the ADP-ribose bound forms of the macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3b"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid diagnosis is an important intervention in managing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.

We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-, IFN-1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF- were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed a serious challenge not only for microbiology laboratories, but also for the clinicians in interpretation of the results. In the specialized world of medicine, knowledge of immunological and infectious diseases has been relegated to the background in many disciplines over time due to the success of antimicrobial therapies and widespread vaccination, so updating them is an urgent and essential part of the fight against the pandemic. Diagnostic tests are important tools for controlling the epidemic and caring for patients, but understanding the interaction between the virus and the human body is essential to form a correct epidemiological and medical opinion. This paper summarizes the medical methods for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the serological testing of the specific immune response of the immune system, their place, role and criteria of their evaluation according to current scientific knowledge.

Using a three-wave longitudinal online survey with N = 304 UK based workers, our results show that OCID during the lockdown in April 2020 (T2) was positively linked to adherence to COVID-19 guidelines at work one month later (T3). We also found a relationship between OCID (T2) and adherence in ones private life (T3) that was fully mediated through adherence at work (T3). Furthermore, we found that a pre-pandemic health climate (T1) was positively linked to our novel measure of organizational climate (T2). Finally, our study revealed that OCID (T2) and a pre-pandemic health climate (T1) contribute to stronger organizational and team identification (T3).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) intimately engages and regulates the host innate immune responses during infection. Using a novel interferon (IFN) antagonism screen, we show that the SARS-CoV proteome contains several replicase, structural, and accessory proteins that antagonize the IFN pathway. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP), which engages and antagonizes the IFN induction and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. PLP blocks these pathways by affecting activation of the important signaling proteins in each pathway, IRF3 and NF-kappaB. We also show that the ubiquitin-like domain of PLP is necessary for pathway antagonism but not sufficient by itself to block these pathways regardless of the enzymatic activity of the protease. The potential mechanism of PLP antagonism and its role in pathogenesis are discussed.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease ubiquitin-like domain and catalytic domain regulate antagonism of IRF3 and NF-kappaB signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The permeability transition (PT) is an increased permeation of the inner mitochondrial membrane due to the opening of the PT pore (PTP), a Ca(2+)-activated high conductance channel involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell death. Alterations of the PTP have been associated with many pathological conditions and its targeting represents an incessant challenge in the field. Although the modulation of the PTP has been extensively explored, the lack of a clear picture of its molecular nature increases the degree of complexity for any target-based approach. Recent advances suggest the existence of at least two mitochondrial permeability pathways mediated by the F-ATP synthase and the ANT, although the exact molecular mechanism leading to channel formation remains elusive for both. A full comprehension of this to-pore conversion will help to assist in drug design and to develop pharmacological treatments for a fine-tuned PT regulation.

Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTUs immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs.","output":"Stable Occupancy of the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus-Encoded Deubiquitinase Blocks Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nasopharyngeal polyps are benign and inflammatory masses assumed to arise from the middle ear or the eustachian tube with extension into the pharynx. The most common clinical signs associated with nasopharyngeal polyps include respiratory stertor, dyspnea, and otic discharge. Neurological signs, including head tilt, facial nerve paralysis, and ataxia, might indicate concurrent involvement of the middle or inner ear. The objective of the current report is to describe a case of a feline nasopharyngeal polyp with a concurrent hiatal hernia and megaesophagus, both spontaneously resolved after removal of the polyp. Case: A 6-month-old female intact domestic shorthair cat was presented for evaluation of lethargy, anorexia, and upper respiratory signs, such as stridor, stertor, and dyspnea. A thoracic radiography revealed esophageal dilation caudal to the cardiac silhouette, suggestive of megaesophagus with gaseous filtration. An esophagram confirmed a hiatal hernia and megaesophagus. Computed tomography revealed a nasopharyngeal mass adjacent to the soft palate and a soft-tissue density in the right tympanic bulla. A tentative diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal polyp was made. After the ventral bulla osteotomy, the nasopharyngeal mass was removed by a gentle traction avulsion technique. Six days after the surgery, hiatal hernia and megaesophagus were spontaneously resolved. Based on histopathologic exam, the mass was found to be an inflammatory nasopharyngeal polyp. Two months after surgery, the owner reported that the patient's condition had returned to baseline with a good appetite, and the thoracic radiography was within normal limit. Discussion: For successful treatment of a nasopharyngeal polyp, traction avulsion of the polyp with or without a ventral bulla osteotomy is recommended. However, in patients with otitis media, a ventral bulla osteotomy followed by traction avulsion of the polyp is recommended in order to reduce the rate of polyp recurrence. Common clinical signs of a nasopharyngeal polyp are stertor, stridor, dyspnea, dysphagia, and open-mouth breathing, which are identified in a chronic upper airway obstruction. A hiatal hernia secondary to a nasopharyngeal polyp has not been reported so far. However, a relationship between chronic upper airway obstruction and hiatal hernias has been proposed previously. Moreover, hiatal hernia resolved spontaneously after removal of the nasopharyngeal polyp suggests that the occurrence of the hiatal hernia was secondary to the nasopharyngeal polyp. In addition to the hiatal hernia, megaesophagus was also identified in the present case. Megaesophagus secondary to a chronic upper airway obstruction from a nasopharyngeal obstruction has been reported. However, megaesophagus is also thought to occur secondary to hiatal hernias. Therefore, in the current study, it is unclear whether the megaesophagus was solely a result of the obstructive nature of the nasopharyngeal polyp or a combination of the hiatal hernia and the nasopharyngeal polyp. In conclusion, any cat with clinical signs of an upper airway obstruction and a concurrent hiatal hernia and megaesophagus should be thoroughly investigated for a nasopharyngeal polyp, as well as other gastrointestinal and systemic causes. Furthermore, this case suggests that the prognosis for a concurrent hiatal hernia and megaesophagus is good in cats if the nasopharyngeal polyp is properly removed.","output":"Concurrent hiatal hernia and megaesophagus secondary to a nasopharyngeal polyp in a 6-month-old cat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many providers, but its impact on Infectious Diseases (ID) fellows in the United States is largely undescribed In this study, we discuss key issues that emerged from the first national ID Fellows Call with respect to the ID fellow's role during the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching/learning, and research","output":"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Infectious Diseases Fellows in the United States: Perspectives From the First National Infectious Diseases Fellows Call"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Delays in timely medical care due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have worsened patient outcomes with different disease conditions.

The waste generated on utilization of bio-resources is almost negligible or zero in a biorefinery along with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, which supports the circular bioeconomy concept. The economic viability of a lignocellulosic biorefinery depends upon the efficient utilization of three major components of LCBcellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The heterogeneous structure and recalcitrant nature of LCB is main obstacle in its valorization into bioethanol and other value-added products. The success of bioconversion process depends upon methods used during pre-treatment, hydrolysis and fermentation processes.

The ratio of these cases increased by 45.5% in 2020 compared to 2019 (189 out of 2367, 137 out of 2479, respectively, p = 0.001). The peak increase was in April 2020 (9.4% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.015). There was no association between the rise of new-onset psychotic or manic episodes and national incidence of COVID19 cases, as observed during Israel 2nd wave. PCR tests were negative, except a single case. In this study, an increase in new-onset psychosis/mania was identified during the initial phase of the pandemic. Though causality could not be directly inferred, lack of infection symptoms, negative PCR testing and temporal distribution incongruent with COVID19 caseload did not support a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2. Alternative explanations are discussed, such as psychological reaction to stress and preventive measures, as well as case-shifting between different mental health settings.","output":"Trends of new-onset psychosis or mania in psychiatric emergency departments during the COVID19 pandemic: a longitudinal comparative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All-cause mortality counts allow public health authorities to identify populations experiencing excess deaths from pandemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies.

This study explored the evaluation results from students regarding the curriculum reform and investigated graduates perceptions regarding the curriculum organization of the two academic training programs affected by this curricular reform. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 14 to June 12, 2019. The 315 graduates from both the 7-year and 6-year curriculum programs in the same medical school in Taipei were invited to participate in this study. In total, 197 completed questionnaires were received, representing a response rate of 62.5%. The results of the principal component analysis confirmed the validity of the constructs employed in this self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The t-test results yielded two main findings. First, the graduates from the 6-year program had significantly lower scores for preparedness for the upcoming postgraduate-year residency training than did their 7-year program counterparts. Additionally, the male graduates had significantly higher scores in terms of perceptions regarding curriculum organization and preparedness for postgraduate-year residency training than the female graduates. The results of stepwise regression also indicated that the sex difference was significantly correlated with graduates readiness for their postgraduate-year residency training. CONCLUSION: To avoid sex disparities in career development, a further investigation of female medical students learning environment and conditions is necessary. In addition to the cross-sectional study of students perceptions, further repeated measurements of the objective academic or clinical performance of graduates in clinical settings are desirable.","output":"Medical undergraduates self-evaluation: before and after curriculum reform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches, sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness.

METHODS: The sample comprised young adults from a longitudinal investigation of 1294 youth recruited at ages 12-13 (1999-2000) in 10 Montral-area high schools. Pre-pandemic data on use of cannabis, alcohol, combustible cigarette, e-cigarette and binge drinking were collected at ages 20.4, 24.0 and 30.6. During COVID-19, data were collected from December 2020 to June 2021 (age 33.6). We studied the prevalence of any and weekly/daily use from age 20.4 to 33.6. Individual-level change in substance use during the pandemic was estimated as differences in the frequency of use from age 30.6 to 33.6 versus from age 24.0 to 30.6. Heterogeneity in the risk of initiated/increased substance use during COVID-19 across sociodemographic subgroups was assessed using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of cannabis use increased from 17.5% to 23.1% from before to during the pandemic; e-cigarette use increased from 3.8% to 5.4%. In individual change analyses, the proportion of participants whose substance use did not change ranged from 48.9% (alcohol) to 84.0% (e-cigarettes). The incidence of initiated/increased cannabis use (22.4%), and quit/decreased alcohol (35.2%) and binge drinking (53.5%) were higher during the pandemic than between ages 24.0 to 30.6.

Two models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms of respiratory failure associated with typical ARDS and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. EXPERT OPINION: ARDS is defined as a syndrome rather than a distinct pathologic entity. There is great heterogeneity regarding the pathophysiologic, clinical, radiologic, and biological phenotypes in patients with ARDS, challenging clinicians, and scientists to discover new therapies. COVID-19 has been described as a cause of pulmonary ARDS and has reopened many questions regarding the pathophysiology of ARDS itself.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is one of the most frequently used critical care technologies in critically ill patients. The prevalence of preexisting sarcopenia and the clinical impact of its prognostic value on patients with MV are unclear. This review sought to identify the prevalence and prognostic value of preexisting sarcopenia on MV patient health outcomes. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane library and were searched for all articles published as of December 2021. The prevalence of sarcopenia was determined using the authors' definitions from the original studies. Comparisons were made between patients who did and did not have sarcopenia for prognostic outcomes, including mortality, the number of days of MV, the length of intensive care unit stay, and the length of hospital stay. Odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for pooled analyses of the relationships between sarcopenia and prognostic outcomes. RESULTS: The initial search identified 1333 studies, 17 of which met the eligibility criteria for the quantitative analysis, including 3582 patients. The pooled prevalence was 43.0% (95% CI 34.0C51.0%; I(2) = 96.7%). The pooled analyses showed that sarcopenia was related to increased mortality (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.70, 2.67; I(2) = 45.0%), longer duration of MV (MD = 1.22; 95% CI 0.39, 2.05; I(2) = 97.0%), longer days of ICU stay (MD = 1.31; 95% CI 0.43, 2.19; I(2) = 97.0%), and hospital stay (MD 2.73; 95% CI 0.58, 4.88; I(2) = 98.0%) in patients with MV.

METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective study based on the secondary use of 2014C2018 real-world data captured in the Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of 1,579 patients (0.72% of the T2D population analyzed; n = 217,632 patients) from 12 representative hospitals in Spain. To access the unstructured clinical information in EHRs, we used the EHRead(?) technology, based on NLP and machine learning. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were considered: MI, ischemic stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, and hospitalization due to unstable angina. The association between MACE rates and the variables included in this study was evaluated following univariate and multivariate approaches. RESULTS: Most patients were male (72.13%), with a mean age of 70.510 years. Regarding T2D, most patients were non-insulin-dependent T2D (61.75%) with high prevalence of comorbidities. The median (Q1-Q3) duration of follow-up was 1.2 (0.3C4.5) years. Overall, 35.66% of patients suffered from at least one MACE during follow up.

This paper is the second part of a series of articles that explore the intricate relationship between the different challenges that have hindered biomedical research and the generation of novel scientific knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first part of this series, we demonstrated that, in the context of COVID-19, the scientific community has been faced with numerous challenges with respect to (1) finding and prioritizing relevant research questions and (2) choosing study designs that are appropriate for a time of emergency. METHODS: During the early stages of the pandemic, research conducted on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sparked several heated debates with respect to the scientific methods used and the quality of knowledge generated. Research on HCQ is used as a case study in both papers. The authors explored biomedical databases, peer-reviewed journals, pre-print servers and media articles to identify relevant literature on HCQ and COVID-19, and examined philosophical perspectives on medical research in the context of this pandemic and previous global health challenges. RESULTS: This second paper demonstrates that a lack of research prioritization and methodological rigour resulted in the generation of fleeting and inconsistent evidence that complicated the development of public health guidelines. The reporting of scientific findings to the scientific community and general public highlighted the difficulty of finding a balance between accuracy and speed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges in terms of (3) evaluating evidence for the purpose of making evidence-based decisions and (4) sharing scientific findings with the rest of the scientific community. This second paper demonstrates that the four challenges outlined in the first and second papers have often compounded each other and have contributed to slowing down the creation of novel scientific knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 and the generation of novel scientific knowledge: Evidence-based decisions and data sharing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Phosphate is a critical anion in maintaining cellular functions. Notably, most important use of phosphate is for ATP production. Thus, a reduction of phosphate levels is detrimental to every organ system. In this case, we describe a patient who presented with rhabdomyolysis caused by hypophosphatemia, which was worsened due to his DKA. Case: A 67 year old male with past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gout, and prostate cancer diagnosed 1 year before presentation presented to the emergency department for complaints of 1 week of weakness, acutely manifested by the patient falling and being found unresponsive on the bathroom floor. He never lost a pulse and was transferred to a facility where he was found to have COVID-19 and labs concerning for diabetic ketoacidosis. He was then intubated for airway protection and transferred to a higher level of care facility. Upon admission into hospital, patient was found to be in septic shock with hypotension, febrile at 38.9C and leukocytosis up to 15,000, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, an insulin drip, and fluid resuscitation. What was notable was his phosphorous level was below 1mg/dL, and rhabdomyolysis manifested with a CK level of around 40,000, and acute renal failure with oliguria and a creatinine of 5.45mg/dl. He also had a pH of 7.27, and a bicarb of 12. He was eventually started on CRRT due to need for dialysis while being hypotensive on pressors. He was kept in the ICU for 9 days where he was treated for multiple organ system failures including shock liver, NSTEMI, multiple ischemic strokes, and kidney failure. Eventually, the patient's family decided to pursue comfort care and stop all lifesaving measures on day 9 and the patient passed away that evening. Discussion: We discuss a rare case in which a patient with DM2 developed DKA, and as a result developed hypophosphatemia, thus causing rhabdomyolysis that required CRRT in a COVID-19 positive patient. Hypophosphatemic rhabdomyolysis induced by DKA is a rare complication not often seen, which makes the management difficult. Hypophosphatemia is usually managed with oral and IV replacement therapy. However, when treating the DKA, the insulin administered also causes the phosphate to move intracellular, thus further reducing serum concentration of phosphate. Our case highlights the difficulty with dealing with a rare complication of hypophosphatemia such as rhabdomyolysis and efforts used to manage such a patient.","output":"Hypophosphatemic rhabdomyolysis with moderate diabetic ketoacidosis in a COVID-19 patient needing continous renal replacement therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Mediumship is understood as a kind of spiritual experience in which a person (i.e., a medium) claims to be in communication with, or under the control of, spiritual beings. In the last decades there has been a resurgence of studies on psychological, psychiatric and neuroscientific aspects of mediumship, as well as studies assessing the claim that mediums can obtain anomalous information from deceased persons. OBJECTIVE To assess the evidence for anomalous information reception about deceased people in texts produced through alleged mediumistic writing (psychographic letters) under strictly controlled experimental conditions. METHOD Eight mediums and ninety-four sitters participated in the study. Eighteen mediumistic writing sessions were carried out using blind proxy sitters. Later, each sitter received the target mediumistic letter and five control letters paired by gender and age. Sitters blindly scored the accuracy of the six letters both with a global score and for each of the objectively verifiable items of information presented on the letters. Scores from target and control letters were compared. RESULTS There was no difference in global evaluation and specific fit scores between control and target letters. The mediums involved in the research were not able to show evidence for providing anomalous information about deceased people when under our strict controlled conditions. We argue for establishing a reasonable compromise between ecological validity and controlled condition.","output":"Testing alleged mediumistic writing: An experimental controlled study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with Complex Emotional Needs (CEN) services, a working description to refer to the needs experienced by people who may have been diagnosed with a personality disorder, face premature mortality, high rates of co-morbidity, service user and treatment costs. Service provision for this population is recurrently identified as needing to be transformed: there are serious concerns about quality, accessibility, fragmentation of the service system and the stigma and therapeutic pessimism service users encounter. Understanding clinician perspectives is vital for service transformation, as their views and experiences shed light on potential barriers to achieving good care, and how these might be overcome. In this study, we aimed to explore these views. METHODS: We used a qualitative interview design. A total of fifty participants from a range of professions across specialist and generic community mental health services across England who provide care to people with CEN took part in six focus groups and sixteen one-to-one interviews. We analysed the data using a thematic approach. FINDINGS: Main themes were: 1) Acknowledging the heterogeneity of needs: the need for a person-centred care approach and flexibility when working with CEN, 2) Still a diagnosis of exclusion: Exploring the healthcare provider-level barriers to providing care, and 3) Understanding the exclusionary culture: exploring the system-based barriers to providing care for CEN. Across these themes, staff highlighted in particular the need for care that was person-centred, relational, empathic, and trauma informed. Major barriers to achieving this are stigmatising attitudes and behaviour towards people with CEN, especially in generic mental health services, lack of development of coherent service systems offering clear long-term pathways and ready access to high quality treatment, and lack of well-developed structures for staff training and support. DISCUSSION: Overall, the findings point towards clinician views as generally congruent with those of service users, reinforcing the need for priorities towards systemwide change to ensure that best practice care is provided for people with CEN. Particularly prominent is the need to put in place systemwide training and support for clinicians working with CEN, encompassing generic and specialist services, and to challenge the stigma still experienced throughout the system. CONCLUSIONS: Staff working with this service user group report that delivering best practice care requires services to be flexible, integrated, and sustainably funded, and for staff to be supported through ongoing training and supervision.","output":"Clinician views on best practice community care for people with complex emotional needs and how it can be achieved: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the United States, underserved communities including Blacks and Latinx are disproportionately affected by COVID19, and widespread vaccination is critical for curbing this pandemic. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of COVID19 vaccine hesitancy, describe attitudes related to vaccination, and identify correlates among racial minority and marginalized populations across 9 counties in North Carolina. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a self administered questionnaire distributed at free COVID19 testing events in underserved rural and urban communities from August 27 to December 15, 2020. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of NO or DO NOT KNOW/NOT SURE to whether the participant would get the COVID19 vaccine as soon as it became available. Results: The sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. Thirty-two percent earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and ~80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and the smallest decline was among Black respondents (12.0). 51.2% of the respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get of the respondents reported they would trust health care providers with information about the COVID19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being female (OR=1.90 95%CI[1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR=1.68 [1.106 2.45]), calendar month (OR=0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR=4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust (OR=3.57 [2.26, 5.63]). Conclusions: This study reached underserved minority populations in a number of different locations to investigate COVID19 vaccine hesitancy. We built on existing relationships and further engaged the community, stake holders and health department to provide free COVID19 testing.

While various single-point estimation approaches have been developed, the non-linearity and multiple site-specific influencing factors associated with MSW management systems make it challenging to forecast MSW generation quantities precisely. To address these concerns, this study developed a two-stage modeling and scenario analysis procedure for MSW generation and taking Shanghai as a test case demonstrated its viability. In the first stage, nine influencing factors were selected, and a hybrid novel forecasting model based on a long short-term memory neural network and an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO-LSTM) was proposed for the forecasting of the MSW generation quantities, after which actual Shanghai data from 1980 to 2019 were used to test the performance. In the second stage, the future influencing variable values in different scenarios were predicted using an improved grey model, after which the predicted Shanghai MSW generation quantities from 2025 to 2035 were evaluated under various scenarios. It was found that (1) the proposed IPSO-LSTM had higher accuracy than the benchmark models; (2) the MSW generation quantities are expected to respectively increase to 9.971, 9.684, and 9.090 million tons by 2025 and 11.402, 11.285, and 10.240 by 2035 under the low, benchmark, and high scenarios; and (3) the MSW generation differences between the high and medium scenarios were decreasing.","output":"Long short-term memory neural network and improved particle swarm optimizationCbased modeling and scenario analysis for municipal solid waste generation in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, is considered a pathogen of animal origin that is mainly transmitted from human to human.

Human-to-mink infection cases have been reported and there are also suggestions that mink-to-human infection occurs. Mink infections have been reported to date only on fur farms, except for one infected free- ranging wild mink near a Utah (USA) fur farm, which suggests a transmission pathway from farms to wild mink.

They were trapped in riverbeds in sparsely inhabited rural areas known to harbor self-sustained feral mink populations. The closest fur farm is about 20 km away. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by two-step RT-PCR in these animals mesenteric lymph nodes and was confirmed by sequencing a 397-nucleotide amplified region of the S gene, yielding identical sequences in both animals.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional online study conducted in the western region of Saudi Arabia from January to September 2019. We used a validated, 12-questions questionnaire to assess the scabies knowledge and the Fear of Scabies Scale-10 (FSS-10) to determine the level of fear toward scabies. RESULTS: A total of 3778 respondents were included with majorities of them being female and between the age of 15C30 years. About 93.3% of the respondents were considered to have good level of knowledge towards scabies and those were more likely to be females, live in an urban area, have heard about scabies in the past, younger in age, achieved higher educational level, and work for the medical and general education sector (all P <0.001). The total possible scores ranging from 10 (less fear) to 40 (greater fear). The mean total FSS-10 score was 33  4.46 with 58.3% of them were considered to have greater fear and those were more likely to be female, younger in age, educated with higher educational degree, work for the general education sector and medical and, but less likely to be unemployed (all P <0.001). Partial correlation adjusting for potential confounders showed significant positive correlation between FSS-10 score and the scabies knowledge score (r = 0.152, P <0.001).

Doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are trained to manage these common conditions and can provide nonpharmacologic treatment aligned with international clinical practice guidelines. Although DCs practice in at least 90 countries, chiropractic care is often not available within integrated health care delivery systems. A lack of DCs in private practice, particularly in low-income communities, may also limit access to chiropractic care. Improved collaboration between medical providers and community-based DCs, or embedding DCs in medical settings such as hospitals or community health centers, may improve access to evidence-based care for musculoskeletal conditions. This scoping review aims to map studies of DCs working with or within medical settings. Methods and analyses: We will use the recommended six-step approach for scoping reviews. We will search three electronic data bases including Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Two investigators will independently review all titles and abstracts to identify relevant records, screen the full-text articles of potentially admissible records, and systematically extract data from selected articles. We will include studies published in English from 1998 to 2020 describing medical settings that have established formal relationships with community-based DCs (e.g., shared medical record) or where DCs practice in medical settings. Data extraction and reporting will be guided by the Proctor Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, which has three domains: clinical intervention; implementation strategies; and outcome measurement. Stakeholders from diverse clinical fields will offer feedback on the implications of our findings via a web-based survey. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published and publicly accessible data. Our results will be disseminated through conference presentations and a peer-reviewed publication.

Safety outcomes were measured based on the diagnostic concordance between physicians. Efficiency was measured based on consultation times, and user satisfaction was evaluated using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS There was a higher caseload of both upper respiratory infections and dermatological conditions in our population, in which telemedicine performed well. In terms of safety, telemedicine achieved a mean diagnostic concordance of 92.8% compared to in-person consultations. In terms of efficiency, consultation times were 26.2% - or 2 minutes and 15 seconds - shorter on average with telemedicine (p = 0.0488). User satisfaction was favourable, with 85.5% of patients satisfied with the VC experience.

This disease is caused by a single stranded RNA virus belonging to Cronaviridae family. This study aimed to design a potential multi-epitopes vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus spike protein (S). Protein characterization was also performed for IBV spike protein. METHODS: The present study used various tools in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to predict conserved B and T cell epitopes against IBV spike (S) protein that may perform a significant role in provoking the resistance response to IBV infection. RESULTS: In B cell prediction methods, three epitopes ((1139)KKSSYY(1144), (1140)KSSYYT(1145), (1141)SSYYT(1145)) were selected as surface, linear and antigenic epitopes. Many MHCI and MHCII epitopes were predicted for IBV S protein. Among them (982)YYITARDMY(990) and (983)YITARDMYM(991) epitopes displayed high antigenicity, no allergenicity and no toxicity as well as great linkage with MHCI and MHCII alleles. Moreover, docking analysis of MHCI epitopes produced strong binding affinity with BF(2) alleles. CONCLUSION: Five conserved epitopes were expected from spike glycoprotein of IBV as the best B and T cell epitopes due to high antigenicity, no allergenicity and no toxicity. In addition, MHC epitopes showed great linkage with MHC alleles as well as strong interaction with BF2 alleles.

We recruited 75 patients in Group A (2020) and 165 patients in Group B (2019). RESULTS: There was a reduction in hospitalizations for non-trauma disease (69 in group A and 122 in group B with p: 0.001), a reduction in transfers from other hospitals (2 patients in group A and 17 in group B with p. 0.04) and a reduction in hospitalizations for trauma disease (6 in group A and 43 in group B with p: 0.001). The severity of the disease in 2020 was greater than in the same period in 2019 and there was a higher rate of high-grade complications CONCLUSION: From data analysis, we conclude that there has been a reduction in hospitalizations and surgical interventions in our emergency surgery department.

METHODS: Patients were included if they underwent primary bariatric surgery (gastric banding [GB], gastric bypass [GBP] and sleeve gastrectomy [SG]) between 2013 and 2019. Costs were disaggregated into cost items and average-per-patient costs from the Australian healthcare systems perspective were expressed in constant 2019 Australian dollars for the entire cohort and subgroup analysis. Annual population-based costs were calculated to capture longitudinal trends. A generalized linear model (GLM) predicted the overall bariatric-related costs. RESULTS: N = 240 publicly funded patients were included, with the waitlist times of  10.7 years. The mean direct costs were $11,269. The operating theatre constituted the largest component of bariatric-related costs, followed by medical supplies, salaries, critical care use, and labour on-costs. Average cost for SG ($12,632) and GBP ($15,041) was higher than that for GB ($10,049). Operating theatre accounted for the largest component for SG/GBP costs, whilst medical supplies were the largest for GB. We observed an increase in SG and a decrease in GB procedures over time. Correspondingly, the main cost driver changed from medical supplies in 2014C2015 for GB procedures to operating theatre for SG thereafter. GLM model estimates of bariatric average cost ranged from $7,580 to $36,633. CONCLUSIONS: We presented the first detailed characterization of the scale, disaggregated profile and determinants of bariatric-related costs, and examined the evolution of resource utilization patterns and costs, reflecting the shift in the Australian bariatric landscape over time. Understanding these patterns and forecasting of future changes are critical for efficient resource allocation.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID-19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","output":"How COVID-19 has impacted the role of pharmacists around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Enhanced recovery pathways (ERP) decrease morbidity and duration of stay after colorectal surgery. There is little information about their role in complex procedures, such as esophagectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an ERP on duration of stay, complications, and readmissions after esophagectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer or high-grade dysplasia from June 2009 to December 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Beginning in June 2010, all patients were enrolled in a 7-day multidisciplinary ERP including written patient education with daily treatment plan, indications for intensive care admission, early structured mobilization, and diet and drain management. Short-term (30-day) outcomes were compared for patients undergoing esophagectomy pre- and post-pathway. Data are expressed as median values [interquartile range]. RESULTS We identified 106 patients; 47 underwent esophagectomy before ERP implementation and 59 after. Patients were similar with respect to age, gender, diagnosis, and operative time. Hospital stay was shorter in the ERP group (8 [7-17] vs 10 [9-17] days; P = .01). There were no differences in rates of complications (59% vs 62%) or readmissions (6% vs 5%).

Here, we designed a three-layer integrated smart dressing, including a biomimetic nanofibre membrane, microenvironment sensor and -cyclodextrin-containing gelatine methacryloyl (GelMA + -cd) UV-crosslinked hydrogel. The hydrogel helped increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to promote neovascularization and wound healing. The microenvironment sensor, combined with the biological dressings, exhibited satisfactory measurement accuracy, stability, durability and biocompatibility. A BLE4.0 antenna was used to receive, display and upload wound microenvironment data in real time. Such integrated smart dressings can not only achieve biological functions but also monitor changes in the wound microenvironment in real time.

The impact of comments has been investigated in several studies. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are just a few of the social media networks that are used to broadcast different news worldwide. In this paper, a comprehensive AI-based study is presented to automatically detect the Arabic text misogyny and sarcasm in binary and multiclass scenarios. The key of the proposed AI approach is to distinguish various topics of misogyny and sarcasm from Arabic tweets in social media networks. A comprehensive study is achieved for detecting both misogyny and sarcasm via adopting seven state-of-the-art NLP classifiers: ARABERT, PAC, LRC, RFC, LSVC, DTC, and KNNC. To fine tune, validate, and evaluate all of these techniques, two Arabic tweets datasets (i.e., misogyny and Abu Farah datasets) are used. For the experimental study, two scenarios are proposed for each case study (misogyny or sarcasm): binary and multiclass problems. For misogyny detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT classifier with 91.0% for binary classification scenario and 89.0% for the multiclass scenario. For sarcasm detection, the best accuracy is achieved using the AraBERT as well with 88% for binary classification scenario and 77.0% for the multiclass scenario.

We addressed this question by conducting a reward associative learning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). Throughout the associative learning task, we recorded valence ratings (i.e. liking), skin conductance response (SCR) (i.e. sweating), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward and neutral cues. During acquisition training with partial reward reinforcement, higher IU was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity to neutral compared to reward cues. IU was not related to valence ratings or SCRs during the acquisition or extinction training phases. These preliminary results suggest that IU-related deficits during extinction may be limited to situations with threat. The findings further our conceptual understanding of IUs role in the associative learning and extinction of reward, and in relation to the processing of threat and reward more generally.","output":"The role of intolerance of uncertainty in the acquisition and extinction of reward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: A previously unseen body of scientific knowledge of varying quality has been produced during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It has proven extremely difficult to navigate for experts and laymen alike, giving rise to the so-called Infodemic, a breeding ground for misinformation. This has a potential impact on vaccine hesitancy that must be considered in a situation where efficient vaccination campaigns are of the greatest importance. We aimed at describing the polarization and volumes of Italian language tweets in the months before and after the start of the vaccination campaign in Italy. METHODS: Tweets were sampled in the October 2020-January 2021 period. The characteristics of the dataset were analyzed after manual annotation as Anti-Vax, Pro-Vax and Neutral, which allowed for the definition of a polarity score for each tweet. RESULTS: Based on the annotated tweets, we could identify 29.6% of the 2,538 unique users as anti-Vax and 12.1% as pro-Vax, with a strong disagreement in annotation in 7.1% of the tweets. We observed a change in the proportion of retweets to anti-Vax and pro-Vax messages after the start of the vaccination campaign in Italy. Although the most shared tweets are those of opposite orientation, the most retweeted users are moderately polarized. CONCLUSIONS: The disagreement on the manual classification of tweets highlights a potential risk for misinterpretation of tweets among the general population.

However, the results were not consistent on the association between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. In the study, air pollution data and the confirmed cases of COVID-19 were both gathered from five severe cities across three countries in South America. Daily real-time population regeneration (R(t)) was calculated to assess the spread of COVID-19. Two frequently used models, generalized additive models (GAM) and multiple linear regression, were both used to explore the impact of environmental pollutants on the epidemic. Wide ranges of all six air pollutants were detected across the five cities. Spearmans correlation analysis confirmed the positive correlation within six pollutants. Rt value showed a gradual decline in all the five cities. Further analysis showed that the association between air pollution and COVID-19 varied across five cities. According to our research results, even for the same region, varied models gave inconsistent results.

We previously described that the immunosuppressive tryptophan/kynurenine metabolite anthranilic acid correlates with poor prognosis in non-cancer patients. In cancer patients, we observed an elevation of anthranilic acid at baseline (without Covid-19 diagnosis) and no further increase with mild or severe Covid-19. We found that, in cancer patients, Covid-19 severity was associated with the depletion of two bacterial metabolites, indole-3-proprionate and 3-phenylproprionate, that both positively correlated with the levels of several inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we observed that the levels of acetylated polyamines (in particular N(1)-acetylspermidine, N(1),N(8)-diacetylspermidine and N(1),N(12)-diacetylspermine), alone or in aggregate, were elevated in severe Covid-19 cancer patients requiring hospitalization as compared to uninfected cancer patients or cancer patients with mild Covid-19. N(1)-acetylspermidine and N(1),N(8)-diacetylspermidine were also increased in patients exhibiting prolonged viral shedding (>40 days). An abundant literature indicates that such acetylated polyamines increase in the serum from patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease or neurodegeneration, associated with poor prognosis. Our present work supports the contention that acetylated polyamines are associated with severe Covid-19, both in the general population and in patients with malignant disease.

With demographic changes in the society, the demand for nursing care increases. Looking after the health of nursing staff becomes a non-material investment in employees. One of the most important health potentials described in literature is the sense of coherence. It can significantly contribute to maintaining good health, modify ones functioning in a stressful working environment and influence the choice of strategies for coping with stress. AIM: The aim of the study was to describe the specific relationship between the sense of coherence and strategies for coping with stress in a group of professionally active nurses. METHODOLOGY AND METHODS: The study involved 91 nurses in central Poland, aged 22C52. The group was diversified in terms of: education, work system, marital status and place of residence. The study was conducted with the use of: Sense of Coherence Questionnaire SOC-29 and Inventory to Measure Coping Strategies with Stress - Mini-COPE. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of scientific research set out in the Helsinki Declaration. RESULTS: The sense of coherence value in the test group was M = 134.24 (SD = 19.55). In stressful situations nurses most often used active strategies to cope with stress: Planning M = 2.10 (SD = 0.54), Seeking Emotional Social Support M = 1.95 (SD = 0.68) and Seeking Instrumental Social Support M = 1.95 (SD = 0.69), and the least frequently: Alcohol/Drug Use M = 0.28 (SD = 0.48).

Our aim is to provide some practical indications for the correct use of UV-C lamps. METHODS: We studied three UV-C lamps, measuring their spatial irradiance and emission over time. We quantify the error that is committed by calculating the irradiation time based exclusively on the technical data of the lamps or by making direct irradiance measurements. Finally, we tested specific dosimeters for UV-C. RESULTS: Our results show that the spatial emission of UV-C lamps is strongly dependent on the power of the lamps and on the design of their reflectors. Only by optimizing the positioning and calculating the exposure time correctly, is it possible to dispense the dose necessary to obtain SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. In the absence of suitable equipment for measuring irradiance, the calculated irradiation time can be underestimated. We therefore consider it precautionary to increase the calculated times by at least 20%. CONCLUSION: To use UV-C lamps effectively, it is necessary to follow a few simple precepts when choosing, positioning and verifying the lamps. In the absence of instruments dedicated to direct verification of irradiance, photochromic UV-C dosimeters may represent a useful tool for easily verifying that a proper UV-C dose has been delivered.","output":"Ultraviolet C lamps for disinfection of surfaces potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 in critical hospital settings: examples of their use and some practical advice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the acceptance speech delivered upon receipt of the Mandel Berman Service Award from the ASSJ (Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry).","output":"Berman Award Acceptance Remarks 20 December 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Original Investigation titled \\"Changes in the Number of US Patients With Newly Identified Cancer Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,\\"1 published August 4, 2020, there were errors in the Figure and Results sections The percentage of patients who were included in the COVID-19 period was 7 2% The denominators given in the distribution of women with pancreatic cancer has been changed to 16 248 and 1546 to account for 21 patients who did not have gender information In the Figure, an additional column was added to represent data on esophageal cancer, and the dates of the weeks in the periods examined were adjusted by 1 day This article has been corrected 1 ? 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc All rights reserved","output":"Error in Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is classified into two biotypes based on its pathogenicity in cats: a feline enteric coronavirus of low pathogenicity and a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus.

We measured the effects of QBEC and Rf on classic thermodilution-based measurements of QB in six anesthetized pigs. An ultrasound flow probe measured total aortic blood flow (QBA0) at the aortic root. Rf was quantified with the ultrasound dilution technique. QBEC was set to 0-125% of QBA0 and QB was measured using a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in healthy and lung injured animals. PAC overestimated QB (QBPa) at all QBEC settings compared to QBA0. The mean bias between both methods was 2.1 L/min in healthy animals and 2.7 L/min after lung injury. The difference between QBPa and QBA0 increased with an QBEC of 75-125%/QBA0 compared to QEC <50%/QBA0. Overestimation of QBPa was highest when QBEC resulted in a high Rf. Thus, thermodilution-based measurements can overestimate cardiac output during VV ECMO.

Prevalence and predictors of long-term neurological manifestations were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a wide array of symptoms; fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%) and sleep disorders (30%) were the most frequent.

It is simple yet efficient to apply as it does not employ any new Bluetooth protocol but only requires basic inputs that are acquirable from any smartphone with Bluetooth 2.0 and above. This application is built using service-oriented architecture which helps mobile devices to communicate with a data collection server as well as each other. The collected data will be shown in a web application and used to further study the propagation characteristics of new infectious viruses. It also comprises a daily survey that users answer, and which will be used by health officials for early prognosis. The app is currently tested campus-wide and showed salient features in terms of scalability, mobility, and sensing inaccuracy-proof, which has the potential to be applied in larger populations with more complicated scenarios. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Bluetooth-Based Contact-Tracing Mobile App for Airborne-Based Epidemic Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection has challenged the medical community for quickly finding and implementing effective methods of treatment In the absence of a vaccine or specific therapy with proven effectiveness, the usage of convalescent plasma can be the one of perspective methods An important aspect of this technology is the efficient and safe preparation of convalescent plasma To date, in the world literature there are practically no publications about donor recruitment and the specifics of the preparation of convalescent plasma Purpose of the research Presentation of the experience of organizing a workflow for recruiting donors and stockpiling of convalescent plasma with a high titer of virus-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Methods The analysis of the work of the Blood Service of the Moscow Department of Health for stockpiling of COVID-19 convalescent plasma has been executed In total it has been stockpiled 1240 doses The normative documentation has been developed by a working group on the basis of the current federal legislation of Russian federation and been approved by the Moscow Department of Health The titer of neutralizing antibodies (VNA) has been determined as the basic method for assessing the immunological viability of convalescent plasma The main characteristics of donors, the characteristics of the disease course, the results of preliminary testing for the presence of specific antibodies by ELISA and CLIA methods has been compared with VNA titers in the stockpiled convalescent plasma Results Due to a Moscow Health Departments order No 325 dated 01 04 2020 (a basic local regulatory document) it has been developed a regulation for the stockpiling, examination, storage, safety and transfering of fresh frozen pathogen-reduced plasma of COVID-19 convalescent donors to medical organizations of the Moscow Health Department For arranging an interaction with donors it has been created a call-center For effective preliminary selection, it has been formed a donor characteristics list, which has been combined with screening of specific antibodies by ELISA and CLIA methods Conclusions Developed a system of recruiting donors and procurement process of convalescent plasma for treatment OVID-19, which includes the necessary regulations, algorithms for the selection and recruitment of donors, the registry of donors and recipients, algorithms, efficiency and safety of convalescent plasma ҧߧӧѧߧڧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ѧӧڧݧ ֧֧ ާ֧էڧڧߧܧڧ ҧ֧ӧ ٧ѧէѧ ҧԧ ڧܧ  ӧߧ֧է֧ߧڧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ ާ֧էڧ ݧ֧֧ߧڧ  ݧӧڧ ӧڧ ӧѧܧڧߧ  ֧է ֧ڧڧ֧ܧ ֧ѧڧ  էܧѧ٧ѧߧߧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ  ܧѧ֧ӧ էߧ ڧ ֧֧ܧڧӧߧ ާ֧էڧ ѧާѧڧӧѧ֧ ѧߧ٧ڧ ֧ܧߧӧѧݧ֧֧ߧߧ ݧѧ٧ާ () ѧاߧ ѧ֧ܧ էѧߧߧ ֧ߧݧԧڧ ӧݧ֧ ٧ѧԧӧܧ ֧ܧڧӧߧԧ  ҧ֧٧ѧߧԧ ܧާߧ֧ߧ  ֧ԧէߧߧڧ է֧ߧ ҧݧڧܧѧڧ  ֧ܧڧߧԧ էߧ  ҧ֧ߧߧ ٧ѧԧӧܧ   ާڧӧ ݧڧ֧ѧ ѧܧڧ֧ܧ ӧ ֧ݧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ - ߧѧݧڧ  ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ ѧҧ֧ԧ ֧  ڧӧݧ֧֧ߧڧ էߧ  ٧ѧԧӧܧ   ӧܧڧ ڧ ӧڧߧ֧ۧѧݧڧ٧ڧ ѧߧڧ֧  SARS-CoV-2 ֧է ӧ֧է֧ ѧߧѧݧڧ ѧҧ ݧاҧ ܧӧ ֧ѧѧާ֧ߧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ܧӧ ()  ٧ѧԧӧܧ  COVID-19 ֧ԧ ٧ѧԧӧݧ֧ߧ 1240 է ާѧڧӧߧѧ էܧާ֧ߧѧڧ ѧ٧ѧҧѧߧ ѧҧ֧ ԧ ߧ ߧӧѧߧڧ է֧ۧӧ֧ԧ ֧է֧ѧݧߧԧ ٧ѧܧߧէѧ֧ݧӧ  ӧ֧اէ֧ߧ  ѧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧ ާ֧էڧܧ ֧ߧܧ ڧާާߧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ֧ݧߧ , ֧է֧ݧ֧ ڧ ӧڧߧ֧ۧѧݧڧ٧ڧ ѧߧڧ֧ () ӧ֧է֧ߧ ѧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ߧӧߧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧ էߧ, ҧ֧ߧߧ֧ ֧֧ߧڧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ, ֧٧ݧѧ ֧էӧѧڧ֧ݧߧԧ ֧ڧӧѧߧڧ ߧ ߧѧݧڧڧ ֧ڧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧߧڧ֧ ާ֧էѧާ     ڧѧާ  ٧ѧԧӧݧ֧ߧߧ  ֧٧ݧѧ ѧҧ  ٧ѧԧӧܧ, ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ, ѧߧ֧ߧڧ, ҧ֧֧֧ߧڧ ҧ֧٧ѧߧ  ֧֧էѧ  ާ֧էڧڧߧܧڧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ѧڧ  ӧ֧ا֧٧ѧާا֧ߧߧ ѧԧ֧ߧ֧էڧӧѧߧߧ ݧѧ٧ާ էߧ-֧ܧߧӧѧݧ֧֧ߧ COVID-19 ҧݧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ӧѧߧ ߧ ߧӧѧߧڧ ڧܧѧ٧   01 04 2020  325 ܧѧ ҧѧ٧ӧԧ ݧܧѧݧߧԧ ߧާѧڧӧߧԧ էܧާ֧ߧ ݧ ڧާѧݧߧ ܧާާߧڧܧѧڧ  ӧڧާڧ էߧѧާ  ڧӧݧ֧֧ߧڧ ֧ܧߧӧѧݧ֧֧ߧ ڧݧ٧ӧѧݧڧ ֧ ܧݧ-֧ߧ ݧ ֧ܧڧӧߧԧ ֧էӧѧڧ֧ݧߧԧ ҧ էߧ ڧާ֧ߧݧڧ ѧߧѧݧڧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧ էߧ (ݧѧ٧ާ  ߧѧڧҧݧڧާ ٧ߧѧ֧ߧڧާ ڧ  اڧէѧ֧ާ  էߧ-ާاڧ, ֧֧ҧݧ֧ӧڧ  ڧ٧ߧѧܧѧާ ӧߧ ӧڧߧ ߧ֧ӧާߧڧ)  ֧٧ݧѧ ܧڧߧڧߧԧ ֧ڧڧ֧ܧڧ ѧߧڧ֧ ާ֧էѧާ    ѧܧݧ֧ߧڧ ѧ٧ѧҧѧߧ ڧ֧ާ ҧ֧֧֧ߧڧ ֧ܧڧߧԧ էߧ  ֧ ٧ѧԧӧܧ  էݧ ݧ֧֧ߧڧ OVID-19, ӧܧݧѧѧ ߧ֧ҧէڧާ ߧާѧڧӧߧ էܧާ֧ߧ, ѧݧԧڧާ ҧ  ڧӧݧ֧֧ߧڧ էߧ, ֧֧ էߧ  ֧ڧڧ֧ߧ, ѧݧԧڧާ ҧ֧֧֧ߧڧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ  ҧ֧٧ѧߧ ","output":"The Preparation of Convencent Plasma and Recruiting of Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the Portuguese Government issued a remarkable regulation by which irregular migrants who had previously started the regularization procedure were temporarily regularized and thus allowed full access to all social benefits, including healthcare.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a well-established intervention aimed at restoring an individuals exercise capacity and improving their ability to complete their ADLs. Occupational therapists help individuals engage in meaningful occupations, improving their health and well-being. Given the concordance in the aims of PR and the occupational therapy (OT) scope of practice, occupational therapists appear to be well suited as key players in PR programs. However, the benefits of adding OT to PR programs have been sparsely reported in the literature and the role of OT in PR has never been synthesized or reported in national and international guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to explore the role of OT in PR programs, the current guideline recommendations for the inclusion of OT in PR programs, the estimated prevalence of OT in PR programs, and the reported or anticipated effects of OT interventions in PR programs. METHODS: The review will be conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. A comprehensive search will be undertaken in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL (EBSCO) to identify and retrieve relevant literature published in English, French, or Portuguese. Gray literature on international OT association websites will also be identified, including position statements and guidelines relevant to PR programs. All literature published since the establishment of the effectiveness of PR for chronic respiratory disease in 1994 that explores OT in PR programs for these patients will be included. Search results will be exported to Covidence for title, abstract, and full-text screening by two independent reviewers. Data will be extracted by two independent reviewers using a pilot-tested template including the following: the number of PR programs including OT (specifically from surveys), the purpose of the study, the study design, patient characteristics, respiratory conditions included, PR components, OT role, outcomes, and results. Findings will be presented using a narrative summary, supplemented by figures and/or tables. Key themes will be displayed in an infographic or schematic. RESULTS: The study was initiated in January 2021 and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) in February 2021, prior to title and abstract screening. Data collection and analysis and drafting of the manuscript will occur throughout 2021, with expected publication in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this scoping review will help health care professionals improve patient care by broadening their understanding and awareness of the role of OT in PR programs. This role clarification may help to inform program development and clinical decision making and will serve to optimize the delivery of multidisciplinary care for patients in PR programs, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Previously, we demonstrated that asymmetric, phosphorothioate (PS)-modified, chemically stabilized, cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs, called hsiRNAs, support rapid cellular uptake and efficient mRNA silencing both in cultured cells and in vivo. Here, we systematically evaluated the impact of number, structure, and sequence context of PS-modified backbones on cellular uptake and RNAi-mediated silencing efficacy. We find that PS enhances cellular internalization in a sequence-dependent manner but only when present in a single-stranded but not double-stranded region. Furthermore, the observed increase in cellular internalization did not correlate with functional silencing improvement, indicating that PS-mediated uptake may drive compounds to non-productive sinks. Thus, the primary contributing factor of PS modifications to functional efficacy is likely stabilization rather than enhanced cellular uptake. A better understanding of the relative impact of different chemistries on productive versus non-productive uptake will assist in improved design of therapeutic RNAs.","output":"Single-Stranded Phosphorothioated Regions Enhance Cellular Uptake of Cholesterol-Conjugated siRNA but Not Silencing Efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The present study systematically searched important medical databases, assessed the quality of available pieces of evidence, and performed a meta-analysis to test the efficacy of different therapeutic options currently available for treating COVID-19 Materials and methods: PubMed, CNKI, LILACS, Koreamed, WHO clinical trial registry, and medRxiv were searched since December 2019 Any observational or controlled study that tested the efficacy of any pharmacological intervention in COVID-19 patients either prospectively or retrospectively was included in the qualitative analysis We assessed outcomes as dichotomous variables, i e , a patient having a positive clinical outcome Relative risks/risk ratios (RR) having a 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived Studies conforming to inclusion criteria were pooled using the random-effect model Results: Nine trials on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), six studies on antiviral, four studies on monoclonal antibodies, two on corticosteroids, two on convalescent plasma (CP), and one on interferon-2b were included in the systematic review Meta-analysis containing six scientific trials and analyzing 522 patients revealed that the relative risk of positive clinical outcomes with HCQ treatment was 1 042 (95% CI, 0 884 to 1 874) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 12 6 A meta-analysis of two studies analyzing 285 patients showed that the relative risk of clinical resolution with lopinavir and ritonavir combination was 1 152 (95% CI 0 709 to 1 87) Out of various antiviral used, the only remdesivir showed a positive result in a case series Monoclonal antibodies showed decreased C-reactive protein, decreased oxygen, and ventilator requirements A corticosteroid may increase mortality with increased dose Two small case series on CP showed some promising results Conclusion: The study showed slightly favorable results with HCQ, monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, and CP in treating COVID-19 patients Further research is warranted in establishing the efficacy of studied interventions PROSPERO identifier: CRD42020180979","output":"Evaluating the efficacy and safety of the existing repurposed pharmacological agents for treating covid-19: A meta-analysis and systemic review of clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), an attractive DNA amplification method, was developed as a valuable tool for the rapid detection of Toxoplasma gondii. In this study, species-specific LAMP primers were designed by targeting the AF146527 sequence, which was a conserved sequence of 200- to 300-fold repetitive 529 bp fragment of T.gondii. LAMP reaction system was optimized so that it could detect the minimal DNA sample such as a single tachyzoite or 10 copies of recombinant plasmid. No cross-reactivity was found when using DNA from other parasites as templates. Subsequently, a total of 200 human blood samples were directly investigated by two diagnostic methods, LAMP and conventional PCR. Fourteen of 200 (7%) samples were positive for Toxoplasma by LAMP (the primers developed in this study), whereas only 5 of 200 (2.5%) were proved positive by conventional PCR. The procedure of the LAMP assay was very simple, as the reaction would be carried out in a single tube under isothermal conditions at 64C and the result would be read out with 1 h (as early as 35 min with loop primers). Thus, this method has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection and would be useful for rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis, especially in developing countries.","output":"Improvement and Evaluation of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for Rapid Detection of Toxoplasma gondii Infection in Human Blood Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La nueva enfermedad por coronavirus, tambin denominada COVID 19 es la ltima enfermedad infecciosa de preocupacin internacional Originada en Wuhan, China, se extendi a nivel mundial, resultando en la pandemia 2019-2020 y una Emergencia de Salud Pblica de Preocupacin Internacional (ESPII) segn lo declarado por la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud (OMS) Esta enfermedad suele cursar con fiebre, tos, dolor de garganta, dificultad respiratoria, fatiga y malestar general, sin embargo, tambin se han presentado casos asintomticos Su diagnstico se realiza con una combinacin tanto de exmenes clnicos, radiolgicos y moleculares, donde la prueba de reaccin en cadena de la polimerasa con transcriptasa inversa (RT-PCR) ha sido el examen de eleccin para el anlisis de material gentico viral de muestras extradas del tracto respiratorio superior Se ha reportado que COVID-19 se transmite persona a persona o por contacto indirecto por gotas, lo que tiene fundamental importancia en procedimientos clnicos dentales y donde la saliva tendra una funcin crtica en la transmisin de SARS-CoV-2 en la poblacin Es por esto, que los diagnsticos salivales no invasivos podran proporcionar una plataforma de deteccin rpida, temprana y poco invasiva de la infeccin por COVID-19 El objetivo de esta revisin es determinar los beneficios de la saliva como muestra no invasiva para el diagnstico de COVID-19 The new coronavirus disease, also called COVID 19, is the latest infectious disease of international concern Originating in Wuhan, China, it spread globally, resulting in the 2019-2020 pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (ESPII) as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) This disease usually presents with fever, cough, sore throat, respiratory distress, fatigue and general discomfort;however, asymptomatic cases have been reported The diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical, radiological and laboratory molecular tests, where the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been the alternative of choice for the analysis of viral genetic material from samples taken of upper respiratory tract COVID-19 has been reported to be transmitted person-to-person or by indirect fluids drop contact, which is of fundamental importance for clinical dental procedures and where saliva would play a critical role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human to human For this reason, non-invasive salivary diagnoses could provide a platform for rapid, early and non-invasive detection of COVID19 infection The objective of this review is to determine the benefits of saliva as a non-invasive sample for the diagnosis of COVID-19","output":"Deteccin de COVID -19 (SARS-CoV-2) mediante la saliva: una alternativa diagnstica poco invasiva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of myelin, a fatty sheath that insulates nerve fibers, is critical for brain function.

And along this way, the key to find the optimal strategy for disease control is to obtain a large number of simulations of disease transitions under different scenarios. Therefore, the models that can simulate the spreading of diseases under scenarios closer to the reality and are with high efficiency are preferred. In the realistic social networks, the random contact, including contacts between people in the public places and the public transits, becomes the important access for the spreading of infectious diseases. In this paper, a model can efficiently simulate the spreading of infectious diseases under random contacts is proposed. In this approach, the random contact between people is characterized by the random matrix with elements randomly generated and the spread of the diseases is simulated by the Markov process. We report an interesting property of the proposed model: the main indicators of the spreading of the diseases such as the death rate are invariant of the size of the population. Therefore, representative simulations can be conducted on models consist of small number of populations. The main advantage of this model is that it can easily simulate the spreading of diseases under more realistic scenarios and thus is able to give a large number of simulations needed for the searching of the optimal control strategy.

Furthermore, failure to incorporate timely detection and management of symptoms increases the risk of partially avoidable complications. A promising approach to overcome these pitfalls is telenursing, which entails proactive care delivery by a PD Nurse Specialist (PDNS) through telephone contacts. We hypothesized that adding telenursing to usual care could fill a gap in currently available services, including offering patients easy accessibility to a nurse with specific expertise in PD. We explored this hypothesis by prospectively assessing the effects of a telenursing intervention on motor and non-motor symptoms in a patient with PD. During a threemonth intervention period which comprised 13 telephone contacts, the patient reported a remarkable reduction in number of falls, from 99 falls per three months to 3 falls per three months; and a reduction in non-motor symptoms. The main working mechanism was presumably rather indirect and mediated via alleviation of anxiety, achieved by the individually tailored information and problem-solving strategies provided by the PDNS.

We aimed to evaluate pre-operative planning and post-operative outcomes in expedited colorectal surgery (ECRS), emergency general surgery (EGS), and emergency orthopaedic surgery (EOS) during the COVID-19 era at our rural hospital. METHOD: This was a prospective observational cohort study. Electronic hospital systems identified adult patients who underwent ECRS, major EGS or EOS at our site, from the start of the UK lockdown. RESULTS: Following exclusion criteria, 98 patients were included in data analysis. Post-operative respiratory complications were seen in 27.8% of ECRS patients, 13.3% of EGS patients and 4% of EOS patients. 2 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with 1 COVID-19 associated mortality. Length of hospital stay was reduced for EOS in the COVID-19 setting and this was found to be statistically significant (p value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When compared to the literature, COVID-19 related complications in surgical patients were found to be lower at our rural hospital. This could be due to regional variation in the prevalence of COVID-19. If there were to be a second surge, we suggest NHS Trusts should be given the autonomy to make local decisions on modifying their elective caseload, rather than following a national one-size-fits-all guideline.","output":"287 COVID-19 and Surgical Specialties C Lessons Learnt: A Rural DGH Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the unprecedented surge of patients with COVID-19, Massachusetts General Hospital created both repurposed and de-novo COVID-19 inpatient general medicine and intensive care units.

While the use of face masks has been shown to reduce the number of transmissions of COVID-19, it has also generated a high amount of waste, undermining the capacity of authorities and dumping areas to manage medical waste correctly. Latin American countries are particularly vulnerable because they are not self-sufficient to ensure adequate used facemasks management during the outbreak. The pandemic has led to poor purchasing practices, use, and disposal of this type of product, which can cause environmental contamination and health problems. This article focuses on Latin American using Mexico as a study case since it is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. That shows the health risks of the population exposed to social inequalities and evaluates the future environmental implications arising from a lack of legislation for correct disposal of waste management in several Latin American countries, such as the generation of microplastics or plastic pollution. Since the pandemic is predicted to last until 2021, this is a good scenario to develop new policies for good urban solid waste management in favor of human health and the environment.","output":"The Massive Misuse of Face Mask as a Risk to COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin American: The Case of Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose is to provide a comprehensive report describing the clinical and imaging features of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) and associated comorbidities. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 25 patients (12 males and 13 females, mean age of 53.99.1 years). All patients had positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 and histopathological proof of AIFS. Patients underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance examinations to assess sinonasal, orbital, and cranial spread. RESULTS: The most prevalent comorbidity among the study cohort was diabetes mellitus (DM). Twenty-one patients (84%) were diagnosed in the post-COVID-19 period after hospital discharge, with a mean interval of 19.19.2 days. Steroid treatment was given to 19 patients (76%). Orbital manifestations were the presenting symptoms in all patients, followed by facial edema, nasal discharge, and neurological symptoms. Sinonasal involvement ranged from mucosal thickening to complete sinus opacification by a predominant isodensity on CT, low T1, and high T2 signal intensity with variable enhancement patterns. Twenty-four patients had a unilateral orbital extension, and 12 patients showed signs of intracranial extension. Bone involvement was detected in 16 patients (64%). Follow-up scans in 18 patients (72%) showed rapid progression of the disease. Eight patients (32%) died, six from neurological complications and two from severe respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: Steroids, DM, and severe COVID-19 are the major risk factors of AIFS in the post-COVID-19 era.

Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8-29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52-0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25-0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37-0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23-0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time.

The GP73 cDNA was cloned by differential screening of a cDNA library derived from the liver of a patient with adult giant-cell hepatitis (GCH), a rare form of hepatitis with presumed viral etiology. In vitro transcriptionCtranslation studies indicate that GP73 is an integral membrane protein, and immunolocalization experiments using epitope-tagged GP73 demonstrate that the protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus. Northern blot analysis of RNA from multiple human tissues reveals a single GP73 mRNA transcript with a size of approximately 3.0 kb. Immunohistochemical studies using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against recombinant GP73 demonstrate that the protein is preferentially expressed by epithelial cells in many human tissues. In normal livers, GP73 is consistently present in biliary epithelial cells, whereas hepatocytes show little or no signal. In contrast, livers of patients with GCH display strong GP73 immunoreactivity in multinucleated hepatocytes. GP73 mRNA and protein are expressed in highly differentiated HepG2 hepatoma cells after infection with adenovirus in vitro.

Guidelines exist, but the extent to which they are put into practice and prioritised is unclear. Objectives: To explore the views of primary care professionals around barriers and facilitators to catch-up vaccination in adult migrants (defined as foreign born; over 18 years) with incomplete or uncertain vaccination status and for routine vaccines to inform development of future interventions to improve vaccine uptake in this group and improve coverage. Design: Qualitative interview study with purposive sampling and thematic analysis Setting: UK primary care, 50 included practices. Participants: 64 primary care professionals (PCPs): 48 clinical including GPs, Practice Nurses and healthcare assistants (HCAs); 16 administrative staff including practice managers and receptionists (mean age 45 years; 84.4% female; a range of ethnicities). Results: Participants highlighted direct and indirect barriers to catch-up vaccines in adult migrants who may have missed vaccines as children, missed boosters, and not be aligned with the UK's vaccine schedule, from both a personal and service-delivery level, with themes including: lack of training and knowledge of guidance around catch-up vaccination among staff; unclear or incomplete vaccine records; and lack of incentivization (including financial reimbursement) and dedicated time and care pathways. Adult migrants were reported as being excluded from many vaccination initiatives, most of which focus exclusively on children. Where delivery models existed they were diverse and fragmented but included a combination of opportunistic and proactive programmes. PCPs noted that migrants expressed to them a range of views around vaccines, from positivity to uncertainty, to refusal, with specific nationality groups reported as more hesitant to get vaccinated with specific vaccines, including MMR. Conclusions: WHO's new Immunization Agenda (IA2030) has called for greater focus to be placed on delivering vaccination across the life-course, targeting under-immunised groups for catch-up vaccination at any age, with UK primary care services therefore having a key role to play. Vaccine uptake in adult migrants could be improved through implementing new financial incentives or inclusion of adult migrant vaccination targets in QOF, strengthening care pathways and training, and working directly with local community groups to improve understanding around the benefits of vaccination at all ages.","output":"'We don't routinely check vaccination background in adults': a national qualitative study of barriers and facilitators to vaccine delivery and uptake in adult migrants through UK primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic, for which mild symptoms include fever and dry cough.

It argues that masks first appeared in the disease control scene in late 1919 when the Governor-General of Korea belatedly introduced preventative measures against the Spanish Influenza pandemic. Since then, the central and regional hygiene authorities had begun to encourage colonial Koreans to wear masks whenever respiratory disease epidemics transpired. Simultaneously, Korean doctors and news reporters framed mask-wearing as something needed for family hygiene, particularly for trans-seasonal child health care, and advised colonial Korean women to manage and wear masks. This paper also reveals that the primary type of masks used in colonial society was black-colored Japanese respirators. Its design was the main point of contention in the debates on the effectiveness of masks against disease infection. Finally, it also highlights that the wide support of using masks by medical doctors and authorities was not based on scientific evidence but on empirical rules they developed through the pandemic and epidemics.

This paper presents the first case study using the ADDF concept where not only dissolution and solubility but also permeation of the drug is considered in every step of the formulation development. For that reason, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was used for excipient selection, small volume dissolution-permeation apparatus was used for testing amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), and large volume dissolution-permeation tests were carried out to characterize the final dosage forms. The API-excipient interaction studies on PAMPA indicated differences when different fillers or surfactants were studied. These differences were then confirmed with small volume dissolution-permeation assays where the addition of Tween 80 to the ASDs decreased the flux dramatically. Also, the early indication of sorbitol's advantage over mannitol by PAMPA has been confirmed in the investigation of the final dosage forms by large-scale dissolution-permeation tests.

Studies published to date have used varying methods to preserve and process human heart tissue, and have generated interesting datasets, but development of a biobanking standard has not yet been achieved. Heart transcription patterns are known to be regionally diverse, and there are few single cell datasets for normal human heart tissue. METHODS Using pig tissue, we developed a rigorous and reproducible method for tissue mincing and cryopreservation that allowed recovery of high quality single nuclei RNA. We subsequently tested this protocol on normal human heart tissue obtained from organ donors and were able to recover high quality nuclei for generation of single nuclei RNA-seq datasets, using a commercially available platform from 10 Genomics. We analyzed these datasets using standard software packages such as CellRanger and Seurat. RESULTS Human heart tissue preserved with our method consistently yielded nuclear RNA with RNA Integrity Numbers of greater than 8.5. We demonstrate the utility of this method for single nuclei RNA-sequencing of the normal human interventricular septum and delineating its cellular diversity. The human IVS showed unexpected diversity with detection of 23 distinct cell clusters that were subsequently categorized into different cell types. Cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were the most commonly identified cell types and could be further subdivided into 5 different cardiomyocyte subtypes and 6 different fibroblast subtypes that differed by gene expression patterns. Ingenuity Pathway analysis of these gene expression patterns suggested functional diversity in these cell subtypes. CONCLUSIONS Here we report a simple technical method for cryopreservation and subsequent nuclear isolation of human interventricular septum tissue that can be done with common laboratory equipment. We show how this method can be used to generate single nuclei transcriptomic datasets that rival those already published by larger groups in terms of cell diversity and complexity and suggest that this simple method can provide guidance for biobanking of human myocardial tissue for complex genomic analysis.","output":"A method for cryopreservation and single nucleus RNA-sequencing of normal adult human interventricular septum heart tissue reveals cellular diversity and function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent European legislation emphasizes the importance of enabling people with disabilities to have access to online information and services of public sector bodies.

The computation of topological indices for different chemical structures and networks is a current topic of interest in mathematical chemistry. OBJECTIVE The objective of the present work is to examine the usefulness of the multiplicative degree based indices in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling.

The sensitivity test is conducted to examine the isomer discrimination ability. To study the indices for chemical structures preventing COVID-19, different combinatorial computation methods are utilized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The regression models governing the structural dependence of different properties and activities are derived. The supremacy of the indices as useful molecular descriptors compared to some well-known and most used descriptors is established. Explicit expressions of the indices for hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir (GS-5734) and theaflavin are obtained.

In mice, JPC-3210 was rapidly absorbed and had an extensive tissue distribution, with a brain tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of about 5.4. JPC-3210 had a lengthy plasma elimination half-life of about 4.5 days in mice and 11.8 days in monkeys. JPC-3210 exhibited linear single-oral-dose pharmacokinetics across the dose range of 5 to 40 mg/kg of body weight with high oral bioavailability (86%) in mice. Systemic blood exposure of JPC-3210 was 16.6% higher in P. berghei-infected mice than in healthy mice. In vitro studies with mice and human hepatocytes revealed little metabolism and the high metabolic stability of JPC-3210. The abundance of human metabolites from oxidation and glucuronidation was 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. CYP450 studies in human liver microsomes showed JPC-3210 to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 isozymes, suggesting the possibility of a metabolic drug-drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by these isozymes. In vitro studies showed that JPC-3210 is highly protein bound to human plasma (97%).

In this paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections of COVID-19 by enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of different levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep collaborative supervision (Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the network learning the features of edges and semantics. More specifically, an Edge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level boundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the initial stage of down-sampling. Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised Module (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level semantic information by integrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an Attention Fusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of different levels by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps between high-level and low-level feature maps. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19 CT datasets. The results show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the baseline (ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase Dice metric by 1.12%, 1.95%,1.63% in our dataset, while the integration by incorporating three models together can rise 3.97%.

The analyses focused on changes in the total number of parking events per day and slot as well as their duration. Results Regarding the parking events, there was a clear reduction until the end of April, interrupted by an increase around Easter. After the introduction of mandatory masking, the values recovered to just below the level before lockdown. The duration changed relatively slightly. Initially it decreased, but later rose slightly above the level observed before the restrictions. Over the medium term, there was a slight reduction of parking events and an extension of their duration by a little more than 5%.

In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline - two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections.","output":"Fostering healthy aging: The interdependency of infections, immunity and frailty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy is a safe model for exploration of the peritoneum. Endoscopic insufflation of the peritoneal cavity has not been validated in humans. We report here our experience with pneumoperitoneum established endoscopically with a laparoscopic insufflator. DESIGN Pneumoperitoneum was established with a laparoscopic insufflator through the biopsy channel of the gastroscope. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured with a transfascial Veress needle and compared with endoscopic values. The gastrotomy was used in the creation of the gastric pouch. PATIENTS Twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in the study. Ten had undergone no previous surgery, whereas the other 10 patients had a history of abdominal procedures. INTERVENTIONS Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy was performed through a gastrotomy created endoscopically without laparoscopic visualization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Diagnostic findings, operating times, and clinical course were recorded. RESULTS The average time for transgastric access was 9.6 minutes. This did not vary in patients with previous surgery (P = .3). Endoscopic insufflation was successful in all patients. The mean endoscopic and laparoscopic pressures were 9.80 and 9.75 mm Hg, respectively (P = .9). In no patients were there limitations to visualization of the abdomen. Adhesions were noted in 80% and 10% of patients with and without a history of surgery, respectively (P = .005). There were no complications related to transgastric passage of the endoscope or exploration of the peritoneal cavity. CONCLUSIONS Although limited by the small sample size in this study, we believe that transgastric access may be considered as an alternative approach to peritoneal insufflation and provides a safe alternative for exploration of the abdomen. Endoscopic insufflation through the biopsy channel by using a laparoscopic insufflator seems to be an effective and safe method for establishing pneumoperitoneum.","output":"Endoscopic peritoneal access and insufflation: natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections after complete vaccination are increasing whereas their determinants remain uncharacterized. Methods We analyzed two cases of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infections by  and  variants, respectively.

Results The first participant (P1) was infected by an  variant and displayed an extended and short period of viral excretion and symptom. Analysis of cellular and humoral response 72 h post-symptom onset revealed that P1 failed at developing neutralizing antibodies and a potent CD4 memory response (lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+IL-2+ cells) and CD8 effector response (CD8+IFN+ cells). The second participant (P2) developed post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection by a  variant, associated with a short period of viral excretion and symptoms. Despite displaying initially high levels and polyfunctional T cell responses, P2 lacked initial -directed neutralizing antibodies. Both participants developed and/or increased their neutralization activity and cellular responses against all variants, namely,  and  variants that lasts up to 3 months after breakthrough infection.

The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to investigate independent risk factors for the development of CIN. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2014, all pre-hospital intubated major trauma patients with documented serum creatinine levels (SCr) undergoing a contrast-enhanced whole-body CT at admission were retrospectively analyzed. CIN was defined as a relative increase in SCr > 25% over the baseline value or an absolute SCr increase of > 44 mol/l within 72 h. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors. A p value of < 0.01 was considered statistically significant and a p value of 0.01C0.049 suggested evidence. RESULTS: Of 284 analyzed patients, 41 (14%) met the criteria for CIN. There is suggestive evidence that age and lactate level influenced the development of CIN. Six patients (15%) had hemodialysis in the CIN-group and eight (3.3%) in the group without CIN. Complication and mortality rate was higher in patients with CIN (71% vs. 56% and 32% vs. 23%, respectively). CIN was not an independent risk factor for complications or mortality while controlling for age, gender, injury severity score, and lactate level. The length of stay was not affected by CIN.

This study examined how parental worry and family-based disaster education related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Method: Parents reported parental worry, family-based disaster education and their children's (5-8-year-old young elementary schoolchildren [n = 245] and 245 9-13-year-old early adolescents [n = 245]) internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Data analysis showed that (a) across ages, parental worry related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems significantly and positively; (b) the significant and negative relationships between family-based disaster education and internalizing and externalizing problems were only supported in young elementary schoolchildren; and (c) high level of parent worry attenuated the negative link between family-based disaster education and young elementary schoolchildren's internalizing problems. Conclusion: This study expands our knowledge about relationships between parental worry and children's disaster-related well-being, and highlights the importance of adapting family-based disaster education to different ages. Data suggest that parents of young elementary schoolchildren and early adolescents both should avoid showing excessive worry in front of their children during the pandemic to help reduce their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Effective family-based disaster education can mitigate young elementary schoolchildren's emotional distress and behavioral problems, the effect of which may be maximized if parents can avoid being overly worried.

We tested these sera for the presence of specific antibodies against influenza type A virus using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Our results show that 4% of the tested samples had antibodies in sera, including some doves, chickens, and dogs. These data suggest exposure and seroconversion of these animals or birds to the influenza type A virus. CONCLUSION: The presence of antibodies against influenza type A virus in sera of some animals and birds without a previous vaccination history against the virus indicates a natural exposure history regarding this virus and seroconversion.

We conducted this study to test whether more advanced imaging selection, recently developed devices, and earlier intervention improve outcomes. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who were receiving 0.9 mg of alteplase per kilogram of body weight less than 4.5 hours after the onset of ischemic stroke either to undergo endovascular thrombectomy with the Solitaire FR (Flow Restoration) stent retriever or to continue receiving alteplase alone. All the patients had occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery and evidence of salvageable brain tissue and ischemic core of less than 70 ml on computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging. The coprimary outcomes were reperfusion at 24 hours and early neurologic improvement (8-point reduction on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or a score of 0 or 1 at day 3). Secondary outcomes included the functional score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. RESULTS The trial was stopped early because of efficacy after 70 patients had undergone randomization (35 patients in each group). The percentage of ischemic territory that had undergone reperfusion at 24 hours was greater in the endovascular-therapy group than in the alteplase-only group (median, 100% vs. 37%; P<0.001). Endovascular therapy, initiated at a median of 210 minutes after the onset of stroke, increased early neurologic improvement at 3 days (80% vs. 37%, P=0.002) and improved the functional outcome at 90 days, with more patients achieving functional independence (score of 0 to 2 on the modified Rankin scale, 71% vs. 40%; P=0.01).

RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152.

Despite wide uses of various popular two-sample MR methods based on genome-wide association study summary level data, however, those methods could suffer from potential power loss or/and biased inference when the chosen genetic variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and have relatively large direct effects on the outcome whose distribution might be heavy-tailed which is commonly referred to as the idiosyncratic pleiotropy. To resolve those two issues, we propose a novel Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization (RBMR) model that uses the more robust multivariate generalized t-distribution to model such direct effects in a probabilistic model framework which can also incorporate the LD structure explicitly. The generalized t-distribution can be represented as a Gaussian scaled mixture so that our model parameters can be estimated by the EM-type algorithms. We compute the standard errors by calibrating the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using the likelihood ratio test. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our RBMR has robust performance compared to other competing methods.

Drug repositioning has become a promising treatment strategy in COVID-19 crisis because it can shorten drug development process, reduce pharmaceutical costs and reposition approval drugs. Existing computational methods only focus on single information, such as drug and virus similarity or drug-virus network feature, which is not sufficient to predict potential drugs. In this paper, a sequence combined attentive network embedding model SANE is proposed for identifying drugs based on sequence features and network features. On the one hand, drug SMILES and virus sequence features are extracted by encoderCdecoder in SANE as node initial embedding in drug-virus network. On the other hand, SANE obtains fields for each node by attention-based Depth-First-Search (DFS) to reduce noises and improve efficiency in representation learning and adopts a bottom-up aggregation strategy to learn node network representation from selected fields. Finally, a forward neural network is used for classifying. Experiment results show that SANE has achieved the performance with 81.98% accuracy and 0.8961 AUC value and outperformed state-of-the-art baselines. Further case study on COVID-19 indicates that SANE has a strong predictive ability since 25 of the top 40 (62.5%) drugs are verified by valuable dataset and literatures. Therefore, SANE is powerful to reposition drugs for COVID-19 and provides a new perspective for drug repositioning.","output":"SANE: A sequence combined attentive network embedding model for COVID-19 drug repositioning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 20 million cases and 350 000 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults' knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people's COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public. Health officials must also focus on increasing COVID-19 knowledge and dispelling misinformation.","output":"COVID-19 Sources of Information, Knowledge, and Preventive Behaviors Among the US Adult Population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of birds as reservoirs and disseminators of parasites and pathogens has received much attention over the past several years due to their high vagility. Seabirds are particularly interesting hosts in this respect. In addition to incredible long-distance movements during migration, foraging and prospecting, these birds are long-lived, site faithful and breed in dense aggregations in specific colony locations. These different characteristics can favor both the local maintenance and large-scale dissemination of parasites and pathogens. The Iles Eparses provide breeding and feeding grounds for more than 3 million breeding pairs of seabirds including at least 13 species. Breeding colonies on these islands are relatively undisturbed by human activities and represent natural metapopulations in which seabird population dynamics, movement and dispersal can be studied in relation to that of circulating parasites and pathogens. In this review, we summarize previous knowledge and recently-acquired data on the parasites and pathogens found in association with seabirds of the Iles Eparses. These studies have revealed the presence of a rich diversity of infectious agents (viruses, bacteria and parasites) carried by the birds and/or their local ectoparasites (ticks and louse flies). Many of these agents are widespread and found in other ecosystems confirming a role for seabirds in their large scale dissemination and maintenance. The heterogeneous distribution of parasites and infectious agents among islands and seabird species suggests that relatively independent metacommunities of interacting species may exist within the western Indian Ocean. In this context, we discuss how the patterns and determinants of seabird movements may alter parasite and pathogen circulation. We conclude by outlining key aspects for future research given the baseline data now available and current concerns in eco-epidemiology and biodiversity conservation.","output":"The role of seabirds of the Iles Eparses as reservoirs and disseminators of parasites and pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been estimated that individuals with COVID-19 can shed replication-competent virus up to a maximum of 20 days after initiation of symptoms.

There are several factors that, potentially, can contribute to the differentiated impact of COVID-19, and explain the disparities seen among areas. This study aims to contribute to this debate by analysing the role of health system and social trust in lessening the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in French dpartements. METHODS The data used in this study have been provided by the INSEE and the French Ministry of Health. Database is made up of the 96 dpartements of metropolitan France. We use spatial analysis techniques to identify the groups of areas that are particularly affected, and to test the influence of local socioeconomic factors on the spread of the epidemic. RESULTS Our exploratory spatial analysis reveals the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation of the disease. The use of spatial econometric models, then, allows us to highlight the impact of emergency services, and social capital in reducing the exposition to Covid-19. Our results also report on the role of spillover effects between neighbouring areas. CONCLUSIONS This research shows that, although individual characteristics are important factors in explaining the probability of contracting Covid-19 desease, health care services and social trust factors also play a significant role in curbing the epidemic's outbreak.

We investigated whether working in essential occupations was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and whether foreign-born workers in similar occupations as Swedish-born individuals had a higher risk of the studied outcomes. METHODS: Occupational data (2018C2019) of 326 052 employees (20C65 years) who were resident in Sweden as of 1 January 2020 were linked to COVID-19 data registered from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2021. We analysed the risk of COVID-19 outcomes in different occupational groups and in four immigrant/occupation intersectional groups using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustments for sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and pre-existing comorbidities. RESULTS: We identified 29797, 1069 and 152 cases of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisations and ICU admissions, respectively, in our cohort. Workers in essential occupations had an elevated risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and ICU admissions. Healthcare workers had a higher risk of all the outcomes compared with other essential workers. Relative to Swedish-born workers in non-essential occupations, foreign-born workers in essential occupations had 1.85 (95% CI 1.78 to 1.93), 3.80 (95% CI 3.17 to 4.55) and 3.79 (95% CI 2.33 to 6.14) times higher risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and ICU admission, respectively.

Degradation of Dicer protein is facilitated during vaccinia virus (VV) infection. A C-terminal cleaved product of Dicer protein was detected in the presence of MG132 during VV infection. Thus, it is possible that Dicer protein is cleaved by a viral protease followed by proteasome degradation of the cleaved product. There is a potential I7 protease cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein. Indeed, reduction of Dicer protein was detected when Dicer was co-expressed with I7 protease but not with an I7 protease mutant protein lack of the protease activity. Mutation of the potential I7 cleavage site in the C-terminus of Dicer protein resisted its degradation during VV infection. Furthermore, Dicer protein was reduced dramatically by recombinant VV vI7Li after the induction of I7 protease. If VV could facilitate the degradation of Dicer protein, the process of miRNA should be affected by VV infection. Indeed, accumulation of precursor miR122 was detected after VV infection or I7 protease expression. Reduction of miR122 would result in the suppression of HCV sub-genomic RNA replication, and, in turn, the amount of viral proteins. As expected, significant reduction of HCVNS5A protein was detected after VV infection and I7 protease expression. Therefore, our results suggest that VV could cleave Dicer protein through I7 protease to facilitate Dicer degradation, and in turn, suppress the processing of miRNAs. Effect of Dicer protein on VV replication was also studied. Exogenous expression of Dicer protein suppresses VV replication slightly while knockdown of Dicer protein does not affect VV replication significantly.","output":"Cleavage of Dicer Protein by I7 Protease during Vaccinia Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is the identification of racial differences in characteristics and comorbidities in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and the impact on outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a retrospective observational study. METHODS: Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States, with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The study included 336 Black and 408 White patients. Black patients were younger (62.9  15.0 years vs 71.8  16.4, P < .001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4  8.6 kg/m2 vs 28.8  7.5, P < .001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P = .02), and presented later (6.6  5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4  5.4, P = .006) compared with White patients. Younger Black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age <65 years, 69.9%) than older Black patients (age >65 years, 39.2%) and younger White patients (age < 65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (Black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P = .08).

The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. METHODS: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed-effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti-spike). Higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (P = 0.03). In pairwise comparison amongst ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD and anti-spike than O donors (P < 0.05). No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. Non-ECMO recipient anti-RBD antibody titre increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (P = 0.01) and anti-spike antibody titre by 40.3% (P = 0.02).

However, widespread curricular changes focused on integration of subjects and clinical content resulted in minimal contact hours for anatomical sciences and increasing reliance on adjunct online resources. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for quality online teaching materials. Despite the central role online resources play in anatomical sciences, most remain subject-specific with minimal integration of other disciplines;thus, the educational effect of integrated online resources is unclear. To that end, two versions of a head and neck gross anatomy tutorial were created;although the gross anatomy content was identical, the experimental tutorial also integrated embryology of the head and neck. In a Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) exempt #20-2175 randomized single blind study, the first (DS1) and the second year (DS2) dental students enrolled in a gross anatomy course were recruited. The DS1s had never been exposed to the content of the tutorial while the DS2s had learned the content in the prior year. All participants completed a pre-test. Then the participants were randomly assigned to access either the control or the experimental tutorial before completing a post-test and a survey. DS1s also completed a retention test one week after completing the post-test. Seventy-one DS1s, and 71 DS2s completed the study. Both cohorts scored statistically higher in the post-test compared to the pre-test (Tukey HSD, all p's &lt; 0.001). The post-test performance increase for DS2s was significantly higher than for DS1s (main cohort effect: F(1,2) = 4.88, p &lt; 0.05, partial h2 = 0.06, Tukey HSD, p &lt; 0.05). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significantly higher retention test score compared to the pre-test scores for DS1 (Tukey HSD: p &lt; 0.01). Thematic analytics of the survey comments were mostly positive and similar across the experimental conditions. Notably, the experimental group indicated a positive perception of integrated embryology content attributed to providing context for gross anatomy. These findings suggest that a digital tutorial on head and neck anatomy leads to significant learning and short-term retention, regardless of integrated embryology content presentation, but based on thematic analysis students perceive the integrated content to be contextually valuable. The post-test increase difference between DS1 andDS2 indicate that the digital tutorials yield better outcomes as a review resource as opposed to an introductory resource.","output":"What the head and neck?

The sample-size weighted average correlation between age and face mask wearing was ?.07 (95%C.I.[?.14, .001], Z-value = ?1.928, P = .054, n = 824), indicating that older individuals are slightly less likely to wear face masks compared to younger individuals. Age did not have significant relations with any face mask perceptions, and the mediating effect of face mask perceptions was not robust or consistent. This indicates that the relation between age and face mask wearing is not explained by face mask perceptions, and researchers must turn to other explanatory mechanisms to understand this relation.

Analysis of \\"read\\" receipts revealed that on average, 60% of messages were consistently read within 24 hours of delivery, 34% were read in 2 hours, and 16% were read in 10 minutes. Readership peaked and fell in the first week of messaging but remained consistent throughout the remainder of the intervention. A survey administered after 2 weeks revealed that 163 (79%) users found enterprise texts \\"valuable,\\" 152 (73%) users would recommend these texts to their colleagues, and 114 (55%) users preferred texts to email. A second survey at 9 weeks revealed that 109 (80%) users continued to find texts \\"valuable.\\" Enterprise messaging, in conjunction with the system's larger communication strategy, was associated with a decrease in median daily occupational exposure events (nine events per day premessaging versus one event per day during messaging). CONCLUSION: Enterprise text messages sent to hospital-employee smartphones are an efficient and effective strategy for urgent communications. Hospitals may wish to leverage this technology during times of routine operations and crisis management.","output":"Text Messaging Real-Time COVID-19 Clinical Guidance to Hospital Employees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Histone acetylation is a ubiquitous and reversible post-translational modification in eukaryotes and prokaryotes that is co-regulated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). HAT activity is important for the modification of chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells, affecting gene transcription and thereby playing a crucial regulatory role in plant development. Comprehensive analyses of HAT genes have been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, barley, grapes, tomato, litchi and Zea mays, but comparable identification and analyses have not been conducted in wheat (Triticum aestivum). RESULTS: In this study, 31 TaHATs were identified and divided into six groups with conserved gene structures and motif compositions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to predict functional similarities between Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Triticum aestivum HAT genes. The TaHATs appeared to be regulated by cis-acting elements such as LTR and TC-rich repeats. The qRTCPCR analysis showed that the TaHATs were differentially expressed in multiple tissues. The TaHATs in expression also responded to temperature changes, and were all significantly upregulated after being infected by barley streak mosaic virus (BSMV), Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) and wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TaHATs may have specific roles in the response to viral infection and provide a basis for further study of TaHAT functions in T. aestivum plant immunity.

Considered individually, each RD may seem insignificant, but together they add up to more than 7000 different diseases. Research in RD is not attractive for pharmaceutical companies since it is unlikely to recover development costs for medicines aimed to small numbers of patients. Since most of these diseases are life threatening, this fact underscores the urgent need for treatments. Drug repurposing consists of identifying new uses for approved drugs outside the scope of the original medical indication. It is an alternative option in drug development and represents a viable and risk-managed strategy to develop for RDs. In 2008, the \\"off label\\" therapeutic benefits of propranolol were described in the benign tumor Infantile Hemangioma. Propranolol, initially prescribed for high blood pressure, irregular heart rate, essential tremor, and anxiety, has, in the last decade, shown increasing evidence of its antiangiogenic, pro-apoptotic, vasoconstrictor and anti-inflammatory properties in different RDs, including vascular or oncological pathologies.

These major changes also involved the activity of the Emergency Radiology Department (ERD). This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging studies, both in terms of the amount, frequency and subspecialty of different imaging modalities requested to the ERD of the Maggiore della Carit Hospital in Novara (Italy). METHODS: To this end, our observational study took into account the imaging studies requested by the emergency department during three-time spans. These were defined as phase 0 (pre-pandemic), phase 1 (pandemic peak with complete lockdown) and phase 2 (post-pandemic peak with partial lifting of restrictive measures), as derived from Italian urgent decrees by the President of the Council of Ministers (DPCM) which established the duration and entity of the lockdown measures throughout the pandemic. The dataset was processed and then compared with Pearsons chi-squared test. RESULTS: During the pandemic peak, our data showed a significant drop in the total number of studies requested and a significant rise in computed tomography (CT) studies. In particular, a statistically significant increase in chest CT studies was found, probably due to the high sensitivity of this imaging method in identifying pulmonary involvement during respiratory tract infection of possible viral etiology (SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, we observed a statistically significant decrease of X-ray (XR) and ultrasound (US) studies during phase 1 compared to phase 0 and phase 2 probably due to a reduction in the numbers of ER visits for minor traumas given the mobility restrictions and people hesitancy in visiting the ER due to fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the activity of the ERD was heavily impacted by the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Further studies will be needed to estimate the impact of the pandemic on public health in terms of excess mortality related to delayed diagnosis and care of non-COVID diseases.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of the Radiological Emergency Department: the experience of the Maggiore della Carit Hospital in Novara"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rhode Island (RI) has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the forefront in the development of risk communication strategies. The WHO introduced a range of activities with the purpose of enabling the public to avail verified and timely information on COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Given the various WHO activities to protect the public health during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the extent of familiarity and uptake of the WHO recommendations among the public during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: To do this, we conducted a large-scale Pan-European survey covering around 7500 individuals that are representative of populations from seven European countries, collected online during April 2-April 15, 2020. We use descriptive statistics including proportions and correlations and graphical representations such as bar charts to analyze and display the data. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that information from the WHO in the context of COVID-19 is well trusted and acted upon by the public. Overall familiarity and adherence were quite high in most countries. Adherence was higher for social distancing recommendations compared to hygiene measures. Familiarity and adherence were higher among older, female, and highly educated respondents. However, country level heterogeneities were observed in the level of trust in information from the WHO, with countries severely affected by the pandemic reporting lower levels of trust. CONCLUSION: Our findings call for efforts from health authorities to get regular feedback from the public on their familiarity and compliance with recommendations for preventive measures at all stages of the pandemic, to further develop and adapt risk communication as the pandemic evolves.","output":"Risk communication during COVID-19: A descriptive study on familiarity with, adherence to and trust in the WHO preventive measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a 60-year-old woman with no drug allergies or toxic habits, with hypothyroidism and receiving treatment with levothyroxine.","output":"Autoimmune hepatitis triggered by COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La rponse vaccinale chez les patients atteints de maladies auto-immunes et inflammatoires peut tre fortement impacte sous certains traitements de fond, tels que le RTX.  ce jour, peu de donnes sont disponibles concernant les JAK inhibiteurs (JAKi), et aucune en lien avec la vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2.

Frequency of LFT abnormality was significantly greater in patients with severe/critical (SC) COVID-19 compared to those with mild/moderate (MM) COVID-19 (32.4% vs 11.6%, p=0.011). Among patients with LFT abnormality, the median age was significantly higher in the SC group compared to the MM group (52 vs 39 years, p=0.021). Conclusion: COVID-19 is frequently associated with mild liver function abnormality, particularly in individuals with severe/critical COVID-19 who were older. Liver function should be monitored carefully during infection, with judicious use of hepatotoxic agents where possible and avoidance of prolonged hypotension to minimize liver injury in older patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to know if coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks can occur in NH with high vaccination coverage among its residents. METHODS: We identified, using national professional networks, NH that suffered COVID-19 outbreaks despite having completed a vaccination campaign, and asked them to send data, using predefined collecting forms, on the number of residents exposed, their vaccination status and the number, characteristics, and evolution of patients infected. The main outcome was to identify outbreaks occurring in NH with high vaccine coverage. Secondary outcomes were residents' risk of being infected, developing severe disease, or dying from COVID-19 during the outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All residents were serially tested whenever cases appeared in a facility. Unadjusted secondary attack rates, relative risks, and vaccine effectiveness during the outbreak were estimated. RESULTS: We identified 31 NH suffering an outbreak during MarchCApril 2021, of which 27 sent data, cumulating 1,768 residents (mean age 88.4, 73.4% women, 78.2% fully vaccinated). BNT162b2 was the vaccine employed in all NH. There were 365 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median secondary attack rates were 20.0% (IQR 4.4%C50.0%) among unvaccinated residents and 16.7% (IQR 9.5%C29.2%) among fully vaccinated ones. Severe cases developed in 42 of 80 (52.5%) unvaccinated patients, compared with 56 of 248 (22.6%) fully vaccinated ones (relative risks [RR] 4.17, 95% CI: 2.43C7.17). Twenty of the unvaccinated patients (25.0%) and 16 of fully vaccinated ones (6.5%) died from COVID-19 (RR 5.11, 95% CI: 2.49C10.5). Estimated vaccine effectiveness during the outbreak was 34.5% (95% CI: 18.5C47.3) for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, 71.8% (58.8C80.7) for preventing severe disease, and 83.1% (67.8C91.1) for preventing death. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of COVID-19, including severe cases and deaths, can still occur in NH despite full vaccination of a majority of residents. Vaccine remains highly effective, however, for preventing severe disease and death. Prevention and control measures for SARS-CoV-2 should be maintained in NH at periods of high incidence in the community.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreaks in Nursing Homes Despite Full Vaccination with BNT162b2 of a Majority of Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Widespread early dementia detection could drastically increase clinical trial candidates and enable early interventions. Since the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) can be potentially used for diagnosing dementia related diseases, it can be leveraged to devise a computer-aided screening tool. Objective: This work aims to develop an online screening tool by leveraging Artificial Intelligence and the CDT. Methods: Images of an analog clock drawn by 3,263 cognitively intact and 160 impaired subjects were used. First, we processed the images from the CDT by a deep learning algorithm to obtain dementia scores. Then, individuals were classified as belonging to either category by combining CDT image scores with the participants age. Results: We have evaluated the performance of the developed models by applying 5-fold cross validation on 20% of the dataset. The deep learning model generates dementia scores for the CDT images with an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 81.3%. A composite logistic regression model using age and the generated dementia scores, yielded an average AUC and average weighted F1 score of 92% and 94.4% , respectively.

Ovaries and pelvic peritoneum are the most common locations for endometrial ectopic tissue, followed by deep infiltrating EM sites. The cyclic and recurrent bleeding, the progressive fibrosis and the peritoneal adhesions of ectopic endometrial glands, may cause different symptoms depending on the origin involved. EM is a frequent clinical condition affecting around 10% of women of mainly reproductive age, as well as in post-menopausal women and adolescents, especially with uterine anomalies. The risk of developing EM depends on a complex interaction between genetic, immunological, hormonal, and environmental factors. It is largely considered to arise due to a dysfunction of immunological surveillance. In fact, women with EM exhibit altered functions of peritoneal macrophages, lymphocytes and natural killer cells, as well as levels of inflammatory mediators and growth factors in the peritoneal fluid. In EM patients, peritoneal macrophages are preponderant and highly active compared to healthy women. Peritoneal macrophages are able to regulate the events that determine the production of cytokines, prostaglandins, growth factors and complement components. Several studies have shown alteration in the regulation of the complement activation, leading to chronic inflammation characteristic of EM. Aberrant regulation/activation of the complement system has been observed in the peritoneal cavity of women affected by EM. Thus, complement inhibition may represent a new approach for the treatment of EM, given that a number of complement inhibitors are under pre-clinical and clinical development. Such an intervention may provide a broader therapeutic control of complement-mediated inflammatory damage in EM patients. This review will focus on our current understanding of the role of complement activation in EM and possible modalities available for complement-based therapy.","output":"Immunological Basis of the Endometriosis: The Complement System as a Potential Therapeutic Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the course of diseases that require emergency surgery.

It is estimated that the majority of all new HIV infections are through injection drug use, with an estimated 2,500 new infections occurring annually among people who inject drugs. Although new HIV infections have been quickly rising over the past year, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preliminarily reported a 50% to 70% intra-pandemic decline in HIV testing. Within Kentucky, an ultra-high-risk state, multiple health departments reported all HIV testing stopped during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-July 2020). Once testing resumed, appointments were sparse. METHODS: To address low rates of HIV testing among PWUD, we evaluated the acceptability of a HIV self-testing program (OraQuick In-Home HIV Test by OraSure Technologies, Inc.) implemented at a health department in Louisville, Kentucky that services PWUD. Descriptive statistics were calculated for testing location, testing self-efficacy, reasons and motivations, ease of use, and preferences for future services. RESULTS: From May to June 2021, a total of 230 PWUD engaged with the program (average of 18 per day). Most participants (87.8%) self-tested at the health department with the help of study staff, while the other 12.2% tested at home and returned at a later time. Approximately 77% of participants reported the self-test kit made them feel better able to keep track of their HIV status compared to standard testing methods. The most common reasons for testing were wanting to know their status (85%), the test was free (37%), fast results (31%), more privacy (23%), and recent high-risk drug use and sexual behaviors (17%). Virtually all (97%) reported the test kits were very easy to use. For future availability of self-test kits through the health department, 33% reported they would use them monthly, 28% every three months, 22% every six months, and 17% annually. In terms of preference for future testing modality, 72% indicated a preference for taking the kits home, while the other 28% indicated a desire to test at the health department with help from staff. CONCLUSION: Program participants found the self-test kits to be acceptable and easy to use. Implications for program implementation and future research will be discussed.

Deep eutectic solvents (DES) were used to extract HA and were synthesized using natural compounds (lactic acid, fructose, and urea). The DES, the soluble fraction of TVH in DES (SF), and the precipitated extracts (PE) were evaluated for their potential use in dry eye disease treatment. In vitro experiments on human corneal epithelial cell lines and the effect on dry eye-associated microorganisms were performed. The influence of the samples on the HCE viability, their intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, inflammatory response, and antimicrobial properties were studied. According to the results, all samples displayed an antioxidant effect, which was significantly higher for PE in comparison to SF. Most of the tested samples did not induce an inflammatory response in cells, which confirmed the safety in ophthalmic formulations. In addition, the DES and SF proved to be efficient against the studied bacterial strains, while PE did not show an antimicrobial effect.

Even though a few candidate drugs, such as remdesivir (a broad antiviral prodrug) and hydroxychloroquine, have been investigated in human clinical trials, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be clarified further to be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we show that pyronaridine and artesunate, which are the chemical components of anti-malarial drug Pyramax?, exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. In human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells, pyronaridine and artesunate were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 while hydroxychloroquine did not show any effect at concentrations of less than 100 M. In viral growth kinetics, both pyronaridine and artesunate inhibited the growth of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells.

Recent studies have explored the contribution of innate immune cells to the pathogenesis of the infection. However, the impact of adaptive immunity on this disease remains unknown. In order to clarify the role of adaptive immune response in COVID-19, we characterized the phenotypes of lymphocytes in PBMCs from patients at different disease stages using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology. Dynamics of the effector cell levels in lymphocytes revealed a distinct feature of adaptive immunity in severely affected patients, the coincidence of impaired cellular and enhanced humoral immune responses, suggesting that dysregulated adaptive immune responses advanced severe COVID-19. Excessive activation and exhaustion were observed in CD8 T effector cells, which might contribute to the lymphopenia. Interestingly, expression of Prothymosin alpha (PTMA), the proprotein of T1, was significantly increased in a group of CD8 T memory stem cells, but not in excessively activated T cells. We further showed that T1 significantly promoted the proliferation of activated T cells in vitro and relieved the lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients.

Next, we examined these immunomodulators in the COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from subjects with high- or low-VLs (~100-fold difference). As compared to low-VL, high-VL patients had prominent mucoinflammatory signature with elevated expression of IL-6, ICAM-1, SCGB1A1, SPDEF, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC4. Interestingly, LASI, TOSL, and NEAT1 lncRNA expressions were also markedly elevated in high-VL patients with no change in MALAT1 expression. In addition, dual-staining of LASI and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N1 RNA showed predominantly nuclear/perinuclear localization at 24 hpi in 3D-airway model as well as in high-VL COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal cells, which exhibited high MUC5AC immunopositivity.

We conducted an analysis of SAG infections to assist clinicians in understanding their burden and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study of medical records, identifying invasive SAG bacteria of sterile-site isolates that were managed from May 2015 to April 2017, at a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical presentation, site of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome were recorded and analyzed to identify factors associated with poor outcome and/or polymicrobial growth. RESULTS: We identified 105 cases of SAG infections in adults, with 52% of the patients being male and the mean age of 52.4 years with comorbidities occurring in more than half of the cases such as diabetes (38%) and malignancy (15%). Overall mortality was 6%, and it was statistically associated with age older than 65 years, polymicrobial growth and a history of malignancy. The infection frequencies were skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI; 55%), intra-abdominal infections (24%), bacteremia (14%), genitourinary infections (8.5%), and pleuropulmonary infections (5%). Abscesses accounted for 68% of cases. Polymicrobial infection (46%) with Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-negative anaerobes coincided with SAG infection. Polymicrobial growth was significantly associated with abscess formation, intra-abdominal source of infections, and poor outcome. In addition, death in patients with SAG was statistically associated with patients older than 65 years of age and those with history of cancer or transplant. CONCLUSION: SSTIs and intra-abdominal infections are the most common clinical presentations in our cohort. Bacteremia was uncommon; however, the prognosis is less favorable. Overall susceptibility to penicillin was 91%, therefore ?-lactam antibiotics are the drug of choice and additional coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria should be considered for intra-abdominal collection and solid or organ abscesses.","output":"Streptococcus anginosus group infections: Management and outcome at a tertiary care hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a global threat to millions of lives.

METHODS: We distributed a questionnaire regarding work, sleep, and excessive fatigue symptoms to 5410 truck drivers, as the riskiest occupation for overwork-related CCVDs, and collected 1992 total samples (response rate: 36.8%). The research team collected 1564 investigation reports required for compensation for Karoshi. Of them, 190 reports listed the prodromes of Karoshi, which were used to develop the new excessive fatigue symptoms inventory. RESULTS: One-way analyses of variance showed that the excessive fatigue symptoms differed significantly by monthly overtime hours (p < 0.001), daily working time (p < 0.001), work schedule (p = 0.025), waiting time on-site (p = 0.049), number of night shifts (p = 0.011), and sleep duration on workdays (p < 0.001). Multivariate mixed-model regression analyses revealed shorter sleep duration as the most effective parameter for predicting excessive fatigue symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that the occurrences of CCVDs were significantly higher in the middle [adjusted ORs = 3.56 (1.28C9.94)] and high-score groups [3.55 (1.24C10.21)] than in the low-score group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that shorter sleep duration was associated more closely with a marked increase in fatigue, as compared with the other work and sleep factors.

Most individuals are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, which raises an inherent question as to how does the immune response differs from patients manifesting severe disease? During the initial phase of infection, dysregulated effector immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitor cells, and Th17 cells can alter the trajectory of an infected patient to severe disease. On the other hand, properly functioning CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, and DCs reduce the disease severity. Detailed understanding of the immune response of convalescent individuals transitioning from the effector phase to the immunogenic memory phase can provide vital clues to understanding essential variables to assess vaccine-induced protection. Although neutralizing antibodies can wane over time, long-lasting B and T memory cells can persist in recovered individuals. The natural immunological memory captures the diverse repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after natural infection whereas, currently approved vaccines are based on a single epitope, spike protein. It is essential to understand the nature of the immune response to natural infection to better identify 'correlates of protection' against this disease. This article discusses recent findings regarding immune response against natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of immunogenic memory.

We aim to investigate the impact of the pandemic on psychiatric services and the severity of presentations in Edinburgh, with a particular focus on the North-West Edinburgh Community Mental Health Team (NW CMHT). METHOD: Measures of the impact of the pandemic on NW CMHT were identified as referral numbers from primary care and Did Not Attend (DNA) rates. Royal Edinburgh Hospital admissions, detentions under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (MHA) and Out of Hours (OOH) contacts were used as proxy measures to explore the severity and urgency of presentations. Quantitative data focussing on these parameters for patients aged 18C65 years in NW CMHT in 2019 and 2020 were collected from NHS Lothian Analytical Services. OOH data were only available Edinburgh-wide. All data were anonymised in line with NHS Lothian Information Governance Policy. In order to assess the impact on staff, a questionnaire was created and disseminated, with qualitative data returned anonymously. RESULT: Referrals to NW CMHT decreased by 9.3% in 2020 (n = 2164) compared to 2019 (n = 2366). Referrals in April (n = 81) and May (n = 102) 2020 were far below the monthly average across the two years (n = 188). Appointment numbers were very similar in 2019 (n = 3542) and 2020 (n = 3514). Despite this, DNA and cancellation rates decreased by 3.94% in 2020. Questionnaire results illustrated some of the challenges for staff of working during a pandemic. Admissions to hospital reduced by 6.8% in 2020 (n = 219 vs n = 235). While MHA detentions in NW Edinburgh increased by only 1.8% (n = 173 vs n = 170), new Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTO) increased by 60%. Furthermore, OOH contacts across Edinburgh increased by 45.2% when compared to 2019. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered the way patients accessed healthcare. Uncertainty of the public in accessing primary care services early in the pandemic may have contributed to reduced referral numbers. The increase in CTOs is suggestive of severe relapses in previously stable patients or new episodes of illness. The pandemic may have contributed to a reduction in early recognition, and referral, of those with major mental disorders resulting in more protracted or severe illness episodes. The increase in OOH crisis contacts supports such a hypothesis. Despite what would be expected, DNA and cancellation rates in NW CMHT reduced.

While this function is preserved across species, centromeres display an array of dynamic features, including: (1) rapidly evolving DNA; (2) wide evolutionary diversity in size, shape and organization; (3) evidence of mutational processes to generate homogenized repetitive arrays that characterize centromeres in several species; (4) tolerance to changes in position, as in the case of neocentromeres; and (5) intrinsic fragility derived by sequence composition and secondary DNA structures. Centromere drive underlies rapid centromere DNA evolution due to the \\"selfish\\" pursuit to bias meiotic transmission and promote the propagation of stronger centromeres. Yet, the origins of other dynamic features of centromeres remain unclear. Here, we review our current understanding of centromere evolution and plasticity. We also detail the mutagenic processes proposed to shape the divergent genetic nature of centromeres. Changes to centromeres are not simply evolutionary relics, but ongoing shifts that on one side promote centromere flexibility, but on the other can undermine centromere integrity and function with potential pathological implications such as genome instability.","output":"Centromeres under Pressure: Evolutionary Innovation in Conflict with Conserved Function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To report the first case in our country of a single access--adrenalectomy with lateral retroperitoneal approach by using SILS port and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this new technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 50-year-old man presented with 38 mm right adrenal incidentaloma, functionally nonactive and without radiologic characteristics suggestive of a malignant lesion, discovered on abdominal computed tomography for nephrolithiasis. The single access adrenalectomy was attempted with multichannel SILS port (Covidien), inserted through a 3 cm transverse incision at the tip of rib XII on the right side. RESULTS The single access retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (SARA) was successfully completed without any intraoperative complications. An additional lateral 5-mm port was needed for retraction of the kidney and for tubular drain in the end stage of the surgery. The operating time was 120 minutes with 40 mL of blood loss. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the second postoperative day. Pathologic examination confirmed cortical adenoma of the adrenal grand. No morbidity within one month of follow-up, and excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSION This is the first case of a single access retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (SARA) by using SILS port was performed in our country. Based on our primary experience, we believe that SARA is a safe and feasible procedure for selected patients with adrenal tumors and when performed by a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic and adrenal surgery. Although initial technical adjustments are inevitable, simplifying the procedure. However, more surgical experience using this technique is required to confirm our initial impressions.","output":"Single-access retroperitoneal adrenalectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Few data regarding follow-up of patients after COVID-19 discharge are available. We aim to describe the long-term outcomes of survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 followed up first at an outpatient facility and subsequently by telephone. METHODS: Observational prospective study conducted at a tertiary general hospital. Clinical and radiological progression was assessed and data recorded on a standardized reporting form. Patients were divided into three groups according to PaO2/FiO2 at hospitalization: PaO2/FiO2 > 300, PaO2/FiO2 300-200 and PaO2/FiO2 < 200. A logistic multivariate regression model was performed to identify factors associated with persistence of symptoms. RESULTS: Facility follow-up: 302 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 45 days after discharge; 78% (228/294) of patients had COVID-19-related symptoms (53% asthenia, 56% respiratory symptoms) and 40% (122/302) had residual pulmonary radiographic lesions. PaO2/FiO2 <200 was an independent predictor of persistent dyspnea; OR = 1.87 (1.38 to 2.52), (p <0.0001). PaO2/FiO2 >300 was associated with resolution of chest radiographic lesions; OR = 0.56 (0.42 to 0.74), (p <0.0001). Fifty per cent of patients required specific medical follow-up after the first consultation and were transferred to another physician. Telephone follow-up: 294 patients were contacted after a median time follow-up of 7 months. Fifty per cent of patients (147/294) still presented symptoms and 49% (145/294) psychological disorders. Asthenia was identified in 27% (78/294) and dyspnea in 10% (28/294) of patients independently of PaO2/FiO2.

In this work, we introduce a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) web service to detect COVID- 19 online. One of the largest public chest CT-scan databases, containing 746 participants was used in this experiment. A number of well-known deep neural network architectures consisting of ResNet, Inception and MobileNet were inspected to find the most efficient model for the hybrid system. A combination of the Densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) in order to reduce image dimensions and Nu-SVM as an anti-overfitting bottleneck was chosen to distinguish between COVID-19 and healthy controls. The proposed methodology achieved 90.80% recall, 89.76% precision and 90.61% accuracy. The method also yields an AUC of 95.05%.

Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows correlations with the available official data on the number of infected individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19 outbreak started in both North (Lombardia) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested on other epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other countries.

Preclinical trial in mice showed that these LNP vaccines could induce VZV-gE IgG titers more than 16 times those induced by an alum adjuvant, and immunized serum could block in vitro infection completely at a dilution of 1:80, which indicated potential as a varicella vaccine. The magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity induced was generally more than 10 times that induced by the alum adjuvant, indicating potential as a zoster vaccine.

Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis is crucial for decreasing its transmission. Various diagnostic techniques like microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and PCR-based methods are used to detect leishmaniasis infection. More recently, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has emerged as an ideal diagnostic measure for leishmaniasis, primarily due to its accuracy, speed and simplicity. However, point-of-care diagnosis is still not been tested with the LAMP assay. We have developed a portable LAMP device for the monitoring of Leishmania infection. The LAMP assay performed using our device can detect and amplify as little as 100 femtograms of L. donovani DNA. In a preliminary study, we have shown that the device can also amplify L. donovani DNA present in VL and PKDL patient samples with high sensitivity (100%), specificity (98%) and accuracy (99%), and can be used both for diagnostic and prognostic analysis.

This study analyzes the complete outbreak data from Wuhan, assesses the impact of these public health interventions, and estimates the asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. METHODS: By taking different stages of the outbreak into account, we developed a time-dependent compartmental model to describe the dynamics of disease transmission and case detection and reporting. Model coefficients were parameterized by using the reported cases and following key events and escalated control strategies. Then the model was used to calibrate the complete outbreak data by using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Finally we used the model to estimate asymptomatic and undetected cases and approximate the overall antibody prevalence level. RESULTS: We found that the transmission rate between Jan 24 and Feb 1, 2020, was twice as large as that before the lockdown on Jan 23 and 67.6% (95% CI [0.584,0.759]) of detectable infections occurred during this period. Based on the reported estimates that around 20% of infections were asymptomatic and their transmission ability was about 70% of symptomatic ones, we estimated that there were about 14,448 asymptomatic and undetected cases (95% CI [12,364,23,254]), which yields an estimate of a total of 64,454 infected cases (95% CI [62,370,73,260]), and the overall antibody prevalence level in the population of Wuhan was 0.745% (95% CI [0.693%,0.814%]) by March 31, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was achieved via the enforcement of a combination of multiple NPIs: the lockdown on Jan 23, the stay-at-home order on Feb 2, the massive isolation of all symptomatic individuals via newly constructed special shelter hospitals on Feb 6, and the large scale screening process on Feb 18.

Cerebral venous thrombosis is the most common manifestation of this syndrome but, to our knowledge, has not previously been described in detail. We aimed to document the features of post-vaccination cerebral venous thrombosis with and without VITT and to assess whether VITT is associated with poorer outcomes. METHODS: For this multicentre cohort study, clinicians were asked to submit all cases in which COVID-19 vaccination preceded the onset of cerebral venous thrombosis, regardless of the type of vaccine, interval between vaccine and onset of cerebral venous thrombosis symptoms, or blood test results. We collected clinical characteristics, laboratory results (including the results of tests for anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies where available), and radiological features at hospital admission of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis after vaccination against COVID-19, with no exclusion criteria. We defined cerebral venous thrombosis cases as VITT-associated if the lowest platelet count recorded during admission was below 150  10(9) per L and, if the D-dimer was measured, the highest value recorded was greater than 2000 g/L. We compared the VITT and non-VITT groups for the proportion of patients who had died or were dependent on others to help them with their activities of daily living (modified Rankin score 3C6) at the end of hospital admission (the primary outcome of the study). The VITT group were also compared with a large cohort of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis described in the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis. FINDINGS: Between April 1 and May 20, 2021, we received data on 99 patients from collaborators in 43 hospitals across the UK. Four patients were excluded because they did not have definitive evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis on imaging. Of the remaining 95 patients, 70 had VITT and 25 did not. The median age of the VITT group (47 years, IQR 32C55) was lower than in the non-VITT group (57 years; 41C62; p=00045). Patients with VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis had more intracranial veins thrombosed (median three, IQR 2C4) than non-VITT patients (two, 2C3; p=0041) and more frequently had extracranial thrombosis (31 [44%] of 70 patients) compared with non-VITT patients (one [4%] of 25 patients; p=00003). The primary outcome of death or dependency occurred more frequently in patients with VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis (33 [47%] of 70 patients) compared with the non-VITT control group (four [16%] of 25 patients; p=00061). This adverse outcome was less frequent in patients with VITT who received non-heparin anticoagulants (18 [36%] of 50 patients) compared with those who did not (15 [75%] of 20 patients; p=00031), and in those who received intravenous immunoglobulin (22 [40%] of 55 patients) compared with those who did not (11 [73%] of 15 patients; p=0022). INTERPRETATION: Cerebral venous thrombosis is more severe in the context of VITT. Non-heparin anticoagulants and immunoglobulin treatment might improve outcomes of VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis. Since existing criteria excluded some patients with otherwise typical VITT-associated cerebral venous thrombosis, we propose new diagnostic criteria that are more appropriate.

RP may improve access to physiotherapy as it delivers physiotherapy services to rehabilitees through information and communication technology (ICT). Even if RP has already been introduced in this century, physiotherapist opinion, amount of use, and form in daily practice has not been studied extensively. OBJECTIVE To investigate physiotherapists' opinion of the current state of RP in Finland. METHODS A quantitative cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was sent to working-aged members of the Finnish Association of Physiotherapists (N= 5905) in March 2021 and to a physiotherapist in a private physiotherapy organization (N= 620) in May 2021. The questionnaire included questions on suitability of RP in different diseases and current state and implementation of RP in work among physiotherapists. RESULTS A total of 9.9% (662/6525; 76.1% female) of physiotherapists (mean age 46.1 years, standard deviation 12.0) answered the questionnaire. The mean suitability \\"score\\" (0 = not suitable at all to 10 = fully suitable) of RP in different disease groups varied from 3.3 (neurological diseases) to 6.1 (lung diseases). Between early 2020 i.e. just before COVID-19 pandemic and spring 2021, the proportion of physiotherapists who used RP increased from 33.8% to 75.4% (P<.001) in the public sector and from 19.7% to 76.6% (P<.001) in the private sector. However, only 11.7% of physiotherapists reported that they spent >20% of their practice time for RP in 2021. The real-time method was the most common RP method in both groups (public sector, 69.7% vs. private sector, 71.7%; P=.470). Three most commonly used technical equipment were computer/tablet (79.0%), smartphone (51.4%), and phone (voice call, 17.6%). The proportion of physiotherapists who used computer/tablet in RP was higher in the private sector than in the public sector (82.8% vs. 67.6%; P=.010). In contrast, a higher proportion of physiotherapists in the public sector than in the private sector used phone (26.5% vs. 14.9%; P=.044). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists increased their use of RP in their everyday practice, although practice time in RP was still low. When planning RP for rehabilitees, it should be considered that suitability of RP in different diseases seems to vary in the opinion of physiotherapists.

Thymosin alpha 1 (T&#945;1) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years. However, clinical benefits and mechanism of T&#945;1 supplement to COVID-19 are still unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe cases with COVID-19 admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020. The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients was measured by T cell receptor excision circles (TREC). The levels of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with untreated group, T&#945;1 treatment significantly reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs. 30.00%, p=0.044). T&#945;1 timely enhances blood T cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia (the counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation lower than 400/L or 650/L, respectively). Under such conditions, T&#945;1 also successfully restores CD8+ and CD4+ T cell numbers in aged patients. Meanwhile, T&#945;1 reduces PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with untreated cases. It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells are roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs.

METHOD: The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones and was performed in 280 consecutive patients with COVID-19. The LUS score based on B-lines, lung consolidation and pleural line abnormalities was evaluated. RESULTS: The median time from admission to LUS examinations was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-10). Patients in the highest LUS score group were more likely to have a lower lymphocyte percentage (LYM%); higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, hypersensitive troponin I and creatine kinase muscle-brain; more invasive mechanical ventilation therapy; higher incidence of ARDS; and higher mortality than patients in the lowest LUS score group. After a median follow-up of 14 days [IQR, 10-20 days], 37 patients developed ARDS, and 13 died.

This ongoing pandemic has had a significant effect on different aspects of societies. The uncertainty around the number of daily cases made it difficult for decision-makers to control the outbreak. Deep Learning models have proved that they can come in handy in many real-world problems such as healthcare ones. However, they require a lot of data to learn the features properly and output an acceptable solution. Since COVID-19 has been a lately emerged disease, there was not much data available, especially in the first stage of the pandemic, and this shortage of data makes it challenging to design an optimized model. To overcome these problems, we first introduce a new dataset with augmented features and then forecast COVID-19 cases with a new approach, using an evolutionary neural architecture search with Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) to generate an optimized deep recurrent network. Finally, to show our approach's effectiveness, we conducted a comparative study on Iran's COVID-19 daily cases. The results prove our approach's capability to generate an accurate deep architecture to forecast the pandemic cases, even in the early stages with limited data.","output":"Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases, Using an Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To understand the global outbreak surveillance needs of stakeholders involved in epidemic response in selected countries and areas in the AsiaCPacific region to inform development of an epidemic observatory, Epi-watch.

RESULTS: All respondents agreed that it was important to remain up to date with global outbreaks. The main reason cited for following global outbreak news was as an early warning for serious epidemics. Mainstream media and specialist Internet sources such as the World Health Organization (n = 54/91; 59%), the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED)-mail (n = 45/91; 49%) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n = 31/91; 34%) were the most common sources for global outbreak news; rapid intelligence services such as HealthMap were less common (n = 9/91; 10%). Only 51% (n = 46/91) of respondents thought that their sources of outbreak news were timely and sufficient for their needs.

We aimed to estimate the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in the Hubei Province and evaluate the risk of an acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak outside China by using a mathematical model and stochastic simulations. RESULTS: We constructed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, estimated the rate of transmission, and calculated the reproductive number in Hubei Province by using case-report data from January 11 to February 6, 2020. The possible number of secondary cases outside China was estimated by stochastic simulations in various scenarios of reductions in the duration to quarantine and rate of transmission. The rate of transmission was estimated as 0.8238 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8095-0.8382), and the basic reproductive number as 4.1192 (95% CI 4.0473-4.1912). Assuming the same rate of transmission as in Hubei Province, the possibility of no local transmission is 54.9% with a 24-h quarantine strategy, and the possibility of more than 20 local transmission cases is 7% outside of China. CONCLUSION: The reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is significantly higher compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China. This implies that human-to-human transmission is a significant factor for contagion in Hubei Province.

Although a host of analytical approaches have been used to date, they are limited, as they require extensive sample preparation, are semi-quantitative and/or are inaccessible to low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, for the first time, we report a simple total analysis system which can rapidly and accurately detect falsified medicines and healthcare supplements. We fabricated a poly-lactic acid (PLA) pestle and mortar and using a commercial 3D printer, then made carbon black/PLA (CB/PLA) electrodes in the base of the mortar using a 3D printing pen to make an electrochemical cell. The pestle and mortar were able to crush and grind the tablets into a fine powder to the same consistency as a standard laboratory pestle and mortar. Using melatonin tablets to characterise the device, the 3D-printed pestle and mortar was able to detect the concentration of melatonin in the presence of insoluble excipients. The calibration plot showed a linear response from 37.5 to 300 g/mL, where the limit of detection was 7 g/mL. Electrochemical treatment was able to regenerate the CB/PLA working electrode allowing for repeated use of the device. In a blinded study, the device was able to accurately determine falsified melatonin tablets with recovery percentages between 101% and 105%. This was comparable to HPLC measurements.

An association between regular working hours and reduced time to initiation of intravenous thrombolysis has been reported. However, its influence on mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains uncertain. We aimed to analyze the effects of admission time on door-to-groin time and stroke outcome in a large prospective stroke registry of the Neurovascular Net Ruhr in Germany. Methods Procedural times of a total of 512 patients treated with MT were analyzed. Admission to hospital during regular working days and hours (Monday to Friday, 8 am to 4 pm) was compared with admission outside these times. Door-to-groin time and the difference in NIH Stroke Scale between admission and discharge served as primary outcome parameters. Long-term functional outcome was centrally assessed with modified Rankin scale. Results MT outside regular working hours was associated with a significant mean initiation delay of 20 min. By multivariate regression analysis, every 20 min delay of MT reduced the difference in NIHSS score between admission and discharge by 0.76 points (95% CI -1.24 to -0.28, p = 0.002). Favorable long-term outcome did not differ between both treatment groups. Conclusions Treatment outside regular working hours caused a significant delay in the initiation of MT, which was associated with a decreased short-term clinical efficacy of thrombectomy.

Mitigating the spread of disease requires an individual to change their routine behaviours to benefit others, resulting in a 'disease dilemma' similar to the seminal prisoner's dilemma. In the classical prisoner's dilemma, evolutionary game dynamics predict that all individuals evolve to 'defect.' We have discovered that when the rate of cooperation within a population is directly linked to the rate of spread of the disease, cooperation evolves under certain conditions. For diseases which do not confer immunity to recovered individuals, if the time scale at which individuals receive information is sufficiently rapid compared to the time scale at which the disease spreads, then cooperation emerges. Moreover, in the limit as mitigation measures become increasingly effective, the disease can be controlled, and the rate of infections tends to zero. Our model is based on theoretical mathematics and therefore unconstrained to any single context.

To explain the potential mechanisms behind the lower number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it has been hypothesized that cigarette smoking may reduce the odds of cytokine storm and related severe inflammatory responses through cholinergic-mediated anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Japanese scientists have recently identified a potential mechanism behind the lower numbers of COVID-19 cases amongst smokers compared to non-smokers. However, we believe that this mitigative effect may be due to the relatively high concentration of deposited energy of alpha particles emitted from naturally occurring radionuclides such as Po-210 in cigarette tobacco. Regarding COVID-19, other researchers and our team have previously addressed the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects of low doses of ionizing radiation. MC-simulation using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit shows that the radiation dose absorbed in a spherical cell with a radius of .9 m for a single 5.5 MeV alpha particle is about 5.1 Gy.

Billing information was used to determine pretreatment and posttreatment use of DSA and CT angiography during hospitalization. RESULTS A total of 4972 patients (1022 clipping, 3950 coiling) at 116 hospitals were identified. The percentage of patients with SAH who underwent pretreatment CT angiography significantly increased from 20% in 2006 to 44% in 2011 (P < .0001), whereas the percentage of patients who underwent DSA remained unchanged from 96-94% (P = .28). This CT angiography trend was observed in coiling patients (17-42%, P < .0001) and clipping patients (32-54%, P < .0001).

Digital mental health interventions are scalable when digital access is adequate, and can be safely delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a new WHO-guided digital mental health intervention, Step-by-Step, supported by a non-specialist helper in Lebanon, in the context of concurring economic, humanitarian and political crises, a large industrial disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a single-blind, two-arm pragmatic randomised trial, comparing guided Step-by-Step with enhanced care as usual (ECAU) among people suffering from depression and impaired functioning. Primary outcomes were depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)) and impaired functioning (WHO Disability Assessment Schedule-12 (WHODAS)) at post-treatment. FINDINGS: 680 people with depression (PHQ-9>10) and impaired functioning (WHODAS>16) were randomised to Step-by-Step or ECAU. Intention-to-treat analyses showed effects on depression (standardised mean differences, SMD: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.97), impaired functioning (SMD: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.65), post-traumatic stress (SMD: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.79), anxiety (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.99), subjective well-being (SMD: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.62) and self-identified personal problems (SMD: 0.56; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83).

Concurrently, infectious disease has been identified as an increasing threat to wildlife conservation. A synthesis published in 2000 showed common anthropogenic drivers of disease threats to biodiversity and human health, including encroachment and destruction of wildlife habitat and the human-assisted spread of pathogens.

For the sake of public health and wellbeing, human-kind needs to work better to conserve nature and preserve the ecosystem services, including disease regulation, that biodiversity provides while also understanding and mitigating activities which lead to disease emergence. We consider that holistic, One Health approaches to the management and mitigation of the risks of emerging infectious diseases have the greatest chance of success.

The Harmonic Focus could outperform electrocautery in dissection of axillary lymph nodes, resulting in shortening of the operative times and minimize postoperative complications. This study aims to compare the mean axillary drain production and the axillary numbness frequency in axillary lymph node dissection (ANLD) during Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) and breast conservative surgery (BCS) between the use of harmonics scalpel and electrocautery. Methods This study includes 40 patients presented with early breast cancer (T1 and T2) underwent BCS or MRM in general surgery department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University Hospital during the period from January 2017 to September 2019. The patients randomly assigned into 2 groups; group A: subjected to ANLD using Harmonic Focus tool and group B: subjected to ANLD using electrocautery. Operative time, total drainage volume, blood loss, duration of the drain and frequency of axillary numbness were recorded. Results This study shows that using Harmonic in axillary dissection considerably reduced operating time, total drainage volume, blood loss, days of hospital stays and reduced axillary numbness level in comparison to conventional electrocautery. Conclusion Compared to the normal electrocautery, the harmonic focus dissection has major advantages in lowering postoperative drainage, blood loss intra-operative and lower incidence of axillary numbness in breast cancer axillary dissection, without affecting operating time.","output":"Evaluation of ultrasonic axillary dissection in preservation of intercostobrachial nerve and lymphatic sealing in breast cancer patients: Randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Decontamination protocols for victims of mass casualty events are well documented and emphasized to protect physicians, nurses and facilities. Decontamination practices outside of mass casualty events are unknown. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the current practices of burn patient decontamination outside of mass casualty events within level I and II trauma center emergency departments in the state of Michigan. METHODS: Using the Michigan Trauma Quality Improvement Project membership, a 10\\\\question online survey was sent to trauma program managers at all level I and II trauma centers in Michigan. Survey questions focused on institutional decontamination protocols and consistency of use. RESULTS: Survey response was 50%. Of the responding facilities, 31% did not decontaminate burn patients. Of the centers who indicated that they did decontaminate burn patients, 31% did not follow a standardized protocol. Our survey revealed that 69% of facilities used a protocol for decontamination: 45% used the protocol consistently on all burns, and 55% at physician discretion. Products used most frequently to decontaminate burn patients included water (100%) followed by soap (44%).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether an innovative mHealth technology system with several overlapping purposes can impact (1) clinical outcomes (ie, readmission rates, revisit rates, and length of stay) and (2) patient-centered care outcomes (ie, patient engagement, patient experience, and patient satisfaction). METHODS: We compared all patients (2059 patients) of participating orthopedic surgeons using mHealth technology with all patients of nonparticipating orthopedic surgeons (2554 patients). The analyses included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were performed on categorical outcomes and a gamma-distributed model for continuous variables. All models were adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities. RESULTS: The inpatient readmission rates for the nonparticipating group when compared with the participating group were higher and demonstrated higher odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 106/2636, 4.02% and participating group 54/2048, 2.64%; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.13; P=.04), 60-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 194/2636, 7.36% and participating group 85/2048, 4.15%; OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.39; P<.001), and 90-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 261/2636, 9.90% and participating group 115/2048, 5.62%; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.34; P<.001). The length of stay for the nonparticipating cohort was longer at 1.90 days, whereas the length of stay for the participating cohort was 1.50 days (mean 1.87, SD 2 vs mean 1.50, SD 1.37; P<.001). Patients treated by participating surgeons received and read text messages using mHealth 83% of the time and read emails 84% of the time. Patients responded to 60% of the text messages and 53% of the email surveys. Patients were least responsive to digital monitoring questions when the hospital asked them to do something, and they were most engaged with emails that did not require action, including informational content. A total of 96% (558/580) of patients indicated high satisfaction with using mHealth technology to support their care. Only 0.40% (75/2059) patients opted-out of the mHealth technology program after enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: A novel, multicomponent, pathway-driven, patient-facing mHealth technology can positively impact patient outcomes and patient-reported experiences. These technologies can empower patients to play a more active and meaningful role in improving their outcomes. There is a deep need, however, for a better understanding of the interactions between patients, technology, and health care providers. Future research is needed to (1) help identify, address, and improve technology usability and effectiveness; (2) understand patient and provider attributes that support adoption, uptake, and sustainability; and (3) understand the factors that contribute to barriers of technology adoption and how best to overcome them.","output":"Assessing the Impact of Patient-Facing Mobile Health Technology on Patient Outcomes: Retrospective Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The relationship between the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and its industry partners has been longstanding, productive technologically, and beneficial to patient care and education. In order to both maintain this important relationship to honor its responsibility to society for increasing transparency, SAGES established a Conflict of Interest Task Force (CITF) and charged it with identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest (COI) and limiting bias at the SAGES Annual Scientific Meetings. The CITF developed and implemented a comprehensive process for reporting, evaluating, and managing COI in accordance with (and exceeding) Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education guidelines. METHODS From 2011 to 2013, all presenters, moderators, and session chairs received proactive and progressively increasing levels of education regarding the CITF rationale and processes and were required to disclose all relationships with commercial interests. Disclosures were reviewed and discussed by multiple layers of reviewers, including moderators, chairs, and CITF committee members with tiered, prescribed actions in a standardized, uniform fashion. Meeting attendees were surveyed anonymously after the annual meeting regarding perceived bias. The CITF database was then analyzed and compared to the reports of perceived bias to determine whether the implementation of this comprehensive process had been effective. RESULTS In 2011, 68 of 484 presenters (14 %) disclosed relationships with commercial interests. In 2012, 173 of 523 presenters (33.5 %) disclosed relationships, with 49 having prior review (9.4 %), and eight required alteration. In 2013, 190 of 454 presenters disclosed relationships (41.9 %), with 93 presentations receiving prior review (20.4 %), and 20 presentations were altered.

This manuscript serves to identify the underlying principles of clinical excellence in telemedicine and to determine whether effective care practices can be generalized as a one-size-fits-all model or must instead be tailored to individual patient populations. A survey assessing care quality and patient satisfaction for patients using telemedicine was created and administered via email to 2 urban cohorts of varying demographics and socioeconomic backgrounds: a population of patients with prior stroke and cerebrovascular disease, and a cohort of patients followed for interstitial lung disease. Results were compared across groups to determine the generalizability of effective practices across populations. Individuals taking part in telemedicine were more likely to be White, more affluent, and woman, regardless of clinical diagnosis compared with a similar cohort of patients seen in-person the year prior. A lower-than-expected number of patients who were Black and of lower socioeconomic status followed up virtually, indicating potential barriers to access. Overall, patients who participated in televisits were satisfied with the experience and felt that the care met their medical needs; however, those who were older were more likely to experience technical difficulties and prefer in-person visits, while those with less education were less likely to feel that their questions were addressed in an understandable way. When thoughtfully designed, telemedicine practices can be an effective model for patient care, though implementation must consider population characteristics including age, education, and socioeconomic status, and strategies such as ease of access versus optimization of communication strategies should be tailored to meet individual patient needs.","output":"The telemedicine experience: using principles of clinical excellence to identify disparities and optimize care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

This approach provides intravoxel distributions of correlations of water mobilities in orthogonal directions, revealing sub-voxel diffusion components. Here we use it to investigate water diffusivities along axial and radial orientations within spinal cord specimens with confirmed, tract-specific axonal injury. First, we show using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry that tract-specific axonal beading occurs following Wallerian degeneration in the cortico-spinal tract as direct sequelae to closed head injury. We demonstrate that although some voxel-averaged diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics are sensitive to this axonal injury, they are non-specific, i.e., they do not reveal an underlying biophysical mechanism of injury. Then we employ 2D diffusion correlation imaging (DCI) to improve discrimination of different water microenvironments by measuring and mapping the joint water mobility distributions perpendicular and parallel to the spinal cord axis. We determine six distinct diffusion spectral components that differ according to their microscopic anisotropy and mobility. We show that at the injury site a highly anisotropic diffusion component completely disappears and instead becomes more isotropic. Based on these findings, an injury-specific MR image of the spinal cord was generated, and a radiological-pathological correlation with histological silver staining % area was performed. The resulting strong and significant correlation (r=0.70,pa?<a?0.0001) indicates the high specificity with which DCI detects injury-induced tissue alterations. We predict that the ability to selectively image microstructural changes following axonal injury in the spinal cord can be useful in clinical and research applications by enabling specific detection and increased sensitivity to injury-induced microstructural alterations.

The fourth variant has just announced its appearance with its high death toll and impact on economic activities. The basic reproductive number R 0 , which measures the transmission potential of an infectious disease, is extremely important in the study of epidemiology. The main purpose of this study was to derive R 0 and assess the stability of the model around its equilibrium points. The motivation was to simulate the effect of COVID-19 on the demand for fashion products and how its application has impacted the COVID-19 pandemic. A five-compartment susceptible-infection-recovery-susceptible-based model was formulated in an integrated environment with application of fashion-based personal protective equipment (FPPEs) and government policy regulation, using ordinary differential equations. Solution techniques included a mix of qualitative analysis and simulations with data from various publications on COVID-19. The study revealed that the disease-free equilibrium was both locally and globally asymptotically stable (LAS and GAS) for R 0  1 , while the disease-endemic equilibrium was both LAS and GAS for R 0  1. As the demand for FPPEs increases, R 0 decreases, and vice versa. The sensitivity analysis indicated that R 0 was very sensitive to the rate of application of FPPEs. This confirms the significance of high demand for FPPEs in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 infection. Again, the pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts on the demand for fashion products;however, the negative impact outweighed the positive impact. Another discovery was that government policy stringency was significant in increasing demand for FPPEs. The sensitivity analyses suggested prioritization of FPPEs application together with all recommended PPEs. We recommend inter alia that FPPEs be used together with other nonpharmaceutical interventions. Operators in the fashion industry must be dynamic in adjusting to the new trends of taste for fashion products. Finally, governments should maintain high policy stringency.

In samples with S/CO []4.00, the neutralizing antibodies ranged from 94.5 to 100%, while in samples with S/CO <4.00, it ranged from 52.0 to 79.2%. The neutralizing antibody seroprevalence strongly correlated with the S/CO range (r=0.62, p=0.002). In conclusion, in populations with high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, neutralizing antibodies are generated in nearly 9 of 10 seropositive individuals.","output":"Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2: a population based seroepidemiological analysis in Delhi, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this research is to assess the effect of Voki, a tool of web 2.0 on students' academic achievement and attitudes towards English courses.

In the experiment group, the \\"Party Time\\" unit was taught via Voki-supported activities while the same unit was taught according to the current curriculum without using Voki in the control group. The entire process of the experiment lasted 6 weeks. In the study, the academic achievement test and attitude scale towards English courses (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.92) were used to measure dependent variables. The normality distributions of the data were examined after the data were collected, and it was decided to analyze the data through the mean, standard deviation, and independent-sample t-test. According to the results of the research, there was an increase in the achievement test scores of both groups in the English lesson. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in the speaking section of the experimental group in the achievement test.

Additionally, the study evaluated a dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system to validate its usefulness for familial-type thyroid carcinoma. METHODS After individual risk factor-matching, 286 patients remained in the FNMTC group, and 858 patients were assigned to the SNMTC group consisting of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The prognostic outcomes were compared between the two groups in a matched cohort. RESULTS During the mean follow-up period of 142 months, recurrences were experienced by 64 patients in the sporadic group (7.5%) and 29 patients in the familial group (10.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for recurrence were primary tumor size (p = 0.033), gross extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). The independent risk factors did not include family history alone (p = 1.101) or the number of affected family members (p = 0.122 for 2 members and p = 0.625 for  3 members). In this matched-cohort study, the DRS system was well adjusted in the FNMTC and SNMTC groups. Moreover, the proportion of DRS categories and the recurrence rate in each DRS category were similar between the familial and sporadic groups. CONCLUSIONS Family history did not present a statistically significant association with a poor prognosis for PTC patients. With a family history of PTC alone, less aggressive treatment could be considered. In this matched cohort, DRS was adjusted well and could be useful in predicting prognosis, even for PTC patients with a family history of PTC.","output":"Comparison Between Familial and Sporadic Non-medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Retrospective Individual Risk Factor-Matched Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND GPs are under considerable pressure providing routine care. However, they may not be the most appropriate professionals to manage getting patients back to work, and keeping them there. OBJECTIVE To test the feasibility of delivering occupational therapy-led vocational clinics (OTVoc) to provide return to work advice and support for people with musculoskeletal conditions and mental health problems, in primary care. METHODS Prospective mixed methods study in two primary care centres (eight GP surgeries). We collected anonymised service level data on all patients receiving OTVoc. Next, patient participants who met inclusion criteria and consented, undertook baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Interviews were also conducted to explore stakeholders' views- GPs, Nurse Practitioners, Front Desk Staff, Occupational Therapists, patients and their employers about OTVoc- and included study eligibility, referral, experiences and attitudes to return to work. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS The majority of standardized measures showed some improvement over the study period: the sickness absence rate dropped from 71 to 15% and use of GP 'fit' notes reduced from 76 to 6%. Interview data indicated positive attitudes to OTVoc, the use of the fit note and the Allied Health Professions Health and Work Reports (AHP H&WRs). GPs felt that OTVoc reduced their workload.

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014). The multivariate analysis found that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio &#8805; 9 (OR 4.64, 95% CI 2.05-10.53) albumin < 3.5gr/dL (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.56-9.07), LDH &#8805; 725 U/L (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.57) and IMV (OR 64.7; 95% CI 15.20-275.39) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusion: NLR, LDH, albumin and IMV are independent risk factors for mortality in Mexican patients with COVID-19. Also, availability of ICU resources is invaluable for better outcomes of critically ill patients.

Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that the Industrial Revolution definitely changed the space of modern landscapes, cities and dwellings life at all scales, and the way in which we perceive them. Cognitive capitalism is no exception. Since it fully established itself as one of the prevailing economic forces in the 21st century and in the Western world, it produced deep changes in the way in which people work, connect, and live. Starting from the assumption that changes in means of production generate new social relationships, this paper investigates how these changes might result in new ways of building architectural space. Without indulging in a deterministic attitude, it focuses on housing as one of the fundamental artefacts where a society expresses its approach to space. The house is a basic element of complex urban systems and is, therefore, the one calling for a more radical conceptual rethinking, marking an effective distance with the forms inherited from the previous centuries. Finally, the paper aims at understanding the repercussions of the digital paradigm on the space of dwelling, reasoning on some crucial questions to understand how housing might evolve, unfolding through its spatial configuration the new ways of life of the digital society.","output":"New approaches to housing complexity: designing dwellings in the age of cognitive economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure learning offers an expressive, versatile and explainable approach to causal and mechanistic modeling of complex biological data.

Despite emerging evidence describing the coagulopathy and its clinical relevance in COVID-19, fewer studies have addressed the potential role of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in this setting. We report the case of a patient admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 whose clinical trajectory improved dramatically after initiation of a therapeutic dose of LMWH. The patient showed progressive elevation of fibrinogen and D-dimers despite a prophylactic dose of LMWH during her ICU stay. This was met with a moderate increase of troponin T-hs, an escalating need for vasopressors, and a progressive decrease in her P/F ratio despite preserved lung static compliance. Her platelet count was normal and had an elevated fibrinogen during the first week of ICU stay. The ECG was normal, and a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and a preserved EF with no regional wall motion abnormalities (RMWA). The chest X-ray was not dissimilar to previous exams, and the ABG showed hypoxia with normal pCO(2) values. The decision was made to commence empiric therapeutic enoxaparin. The patient did not experience bleeding complications, and her clinical trajectory appeared to change dramatically. She was successfully extubated three days later and proceeded to clinical recovery and eventual discharge from the ICU. The available evidence shows that there is undoubtedly coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 with various subsequent forms of clinical manifestation described in the literature. Evidence also shows the benefits of heparin as an anticoagulant. From the discussion of this case report, however, it can be concluded that despite the plausible theoretical rationale, studies pertaining to the role of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in this setting fall short of providing compelling evidence.

The reperfusion success rate, puncture-to-revascularization time, and number of passes were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent factors related to revascularization within 60 minutes. Successful revascularization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was used in 24 of the 40 patients (60%). Although the revascularization success rate was similar between patient groups (P = .229), the number of passes was significantly lower (1.5  .8 versus 2.6  1.3, P = .006) and the puncture-to-revascularization time was shorter (50  26 minutes versus 116  69 minutes, P = .002) in patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was identified as an independent factor for early revascularization (odds ratio, 5.80; P = .041). Among patients with a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months was observed in 15 of the 19 patients (79%) treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE and in 8 of the 16 (50%) who were not (P = .072).

Our model was calibrated with the COVID-19 data (obtained from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control) using the lsqcurvefit package in MATLAB to fit the cumulative active cases and cumulative death data. We adopted the Latin hypercube sampling with a partial rank correlation coefficient index to determine the measure of uncertainty in our parameter estimation at a 99% confidence interval (CI).

Predominantly affecting the respiratory tract, about 20C43% patients also present with extrapulmonary manifestations such as coagulation disorders with thrombotic angiopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: In our institution, a patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain which was caused by portal vein thrombosis. As a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal antigen swab few days earlier was negative, we performed several tests to find out its etiology. After all tests were inconclusive and the patient suffered flu-like symptoms 2 weeks before, we repeated COVID-19 molecular testing and received a positive test result. The patient was treated symptomatically and received therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 infection can also be present without typical pulmonary symptoms. In patients with severe abdominal pain and new diagnosed portal vein thrombosis, it is important to think of a COVID-19 infection. Also, the reliability of antigen nasopharyngeal swab should be considered critically, especially if performed wrongly. We recommended to perform molecular tests when in doubt.

Methods This study explored the potential added value of systematic assessment of DNVs in a retrospective cohort of 123 patients with a suspected sporadic IEI who underwent patient-parent trio-based WES. Results A likely molecular diagnosis for (part) of the immunological phenotype was achieved in 12 patients with the diagnostic in silico IEI WES gene panel. Exome-wide evaluation of rare, non-synonymous DNVs affecting coding or splice site regions led to the identification of 14 candidate DNVs in genes with an annotated immune function. DNVs were identified in IEI genes (NLRP3 and RELA) and potentially novel candidate genes, including PSMB10, DDX1, KMT2C and FBXW11. The FBXW11 canonical splice site DNV, in a patient with autoinflammatory disease, was shown to lead to defective RNA splicing, increased NF-{kappa}B p65 signalling, and elevated IL-1{beta} production in primary immune cells.

Results: : Mean ED attendance decreased from 342 visits/day in the pre-COVID-19 period, to 297 visits/day in the COVID-19 period. This was accompanied by a decline in presentations in nearly every ICD-10-CM diagnosis category except for respiratory-related diseases. Notably, we observed reductions in visits by critically ill patients and severe disease presentations during the COVID-19 period.

Based on these investigations, treatment strategies to reduce drug resistance can be elaborated.","output":"Drug Resistance in Infectious Diseases: Modeling, Parameter Estimation and Numerical Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The potential impact of coronary atherosclerosis, as detected by coronary artery calcium, on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients remains unsettled. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD), as assessed by coronary artery calcium score (CAC), in a large, unselected population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) for clinical practice. METHODS: SARS-CoV 2 positive patients from the multicenter (16 Italian hospitals), retrospective observational SCORE COVID-19 (calcium score for COVID-19 Risk Evaluation) registry were stratified in three groups: (a) clinical CAD (prior revascularization history), (b) subclinical CAD (CAC >0), (c) No CAD (CAC = 0). Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (MI/CVA). RESULTS: Amongst 1625 patients (male 67.2%, median age 69 [interquartile range 58C77] years), 31%, 57.8% and 11.1% had no, subclinical and clinical CAD, respectively. Increasing rates of in-hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 27.3% vs. 39.8%, p < 0.001) and MI/CVA events (2.3% vs. 3.8% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001) were observed for patients with no CAD vs. subclinical CAD vs clinical CAD, respectively. The association with in-hospital mortality was independent of in-study outcome predictors (age, peripheral artery disease, active cancer, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, LDH, aerated lung volume): subclinical CAD vs. No CAD: adjusted hazard ratio (adj-HR) 2.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14C7.17, p=0.025); clinical CAD vs. No CAD: adj-HR 3.74 (95% CI 1.21C11.60, p=0.022). Among patients with subclinical CAD, increasing CAC burden was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality (20.5% vs. 27.9% vs. 38.7% for patients with CAC score thresholds100, 101C400 and > 400, respectively, p < 0.001). The adj-HR per 50 points increase in CAC score 1.007 (95%CI 1.001C1.013, p=0.016). Cardiovascular risk factors were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality when CAD presence and extent were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and extent of CAD are associated with in-hospital mortality and MI/CVA among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease and they appear to be a better prognostic gauge as compared to a clinical cardiovascular risk assessment.","output":"Impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease as assessed by coronary artery calcium in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To recognize the development pattern of COVID-19 coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and to predict the development trend of the epidemic in three categories: the country, Hubei province, and areas outside Hubei province Methods The BloComp model was used to fit existing data With the estimated parameters, we simulated future epidemic development Results The pattern of virus transfer among different populations in Hubei province was significantly different from that outside Hubei province It is predicted by the C-SEIR model that the time when the number of confirmed cases fell to zero in Hubei province and areas outside Hubei will be May 2020 and April 2020, respectively Conclusions The epidemic situation will end at the end of May 2020 Adequate medical resources investment and more comprehensive and accurate investigation of suspected people play important roles in controlling the epidemic situation","output":"Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in Hubei province and areas outside Hubei province/ ʡйCOVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A highly contagious coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by a recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) initially detected in Wuhan, China has spread worldwide and become a major health crisis in the absence of specific vaccine or antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted in overwhelming number of reported deaths. Unfortunately it is still spreading uncontrollably despite implementing stringent protective measures. Rapid development of effective therapeutic strategies for treatment and prevention of infection is crucially required. Although genomic characterization has assisted in unfolding various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 but development of specific antiviral drugs and vaccine against COVID-19 is still a worldwide challenge. Understanding the disease pathological course underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is imperative to identify the vital targets for drug development. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the host cell and primarily target type II alveolar cells. COVID-19 disease progression is associated with distressed immune functions and hyper active inflammatory system leading to development of cytokine storm which is a vital factor involved in disease advancement. The current review elucidates the disease pathology and summarizes the possible therapeutic options to battle against COVID-19 on the basis of current state of understanding about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic pathways and knowledge gained from previous SARS and MERS-CoV epidemics. Therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent infection as well as to suppress the disease progression to reduce severity and mortality rate is discussed.

This study attempted to assess the contribution of aviation volume to air pollution measured by a monitoring station, located 2 km southwest to the airport. We applied cluster analysis to identify TPE contribution to the major air pollutants and estimated their relationship with the number of passengers as a proxy to the flights number. From the airport containing cluster, we observed significant reduction of air pollution concentrations after the travel restrictions. The reduction percentage of SO2 and NOx was higher in the airport cluster (17.7% and 7.3%, respectively) compared to the total station observation (14.7% and 6.8% respectively). Spearman's coefficients indicated positive significant correlations between the number of passengers and PM2.5 (0.06), PM10 (0.21), SO2 (0.24), especially after the travel restrictions. Such low correlations were found due to the distance of 2 km between the monitoring station and the airport runway. This distance could be too far to precisely detect the contribution of aviation to air pollution, which was masked by industrial activities and ground traffic. Measuring air pollution at a closer distance to the runways is required for a better catchment of aviation impact on air quality.","output":"Reduction in Aviation Volume due to COVID-19 and Changes in Air Pollution near the International Airport in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Media devices use among children and adolescents is rapidly increasing due to the small size, which allows mobility, interactivity, and easiness to benefit from free content and applications [...].","output":"Media Use during Childhood and Adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the course of this year, scientific research has revolved around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with much uncertainty surrounding its pathogenesis, complications, and mortality as well as limited pediatric evidence The exact relationship between COVID-19 and new-onset type 1 diabetes, especially in children, remains an unresolved issue Our case exhibited a unique presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) triggering COVID-19 diagnosis at this age A three-year-old Moroccan boy was admitted with a history of acute dyspnea accompanied by vomiting and weight loss, leading to a diagnosis of DKA However, evident respiratory distress signs did not disappear, even though glycemic levels were normalized and acidosis resolved The boy subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), with specific biological and radiological findings Our clinical case potentially augmented the global registry of COVID-19-related diabetes (CoviDiab project) cases and provides a basis for further studies that seek to elucidate the correlation between new-onset type 1 diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population","output":"Diabetic Ketoacidosis at Onset of Pediatric Type-1 Diabetes Triggered by Covid-19: An Original Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens are important public issues. In addition, due to the overuse of antibiotics, many multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens have been widely encountered in clinical settings.

So far, many conventional and molecular methods, both manual or automatized, have been developed for in vitro diagnostics, which have been proven to be accurate, reliable, and time efficient. Although Raman spectroscopy (RS) is an established technique in various fields such as geochemistry and material science, it is still considered as an emerging tool in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Based on current studies, it is too early to claim that RS may provide practical guidelines for microbiologists and clinicians because there is still a gap between basic research and clinical implementation. However, due to the promising prospects of label-free detection and noninvasive identification of bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance in several single steps, it is necessary to have an overview of the technique in terms of its strong points and shortcomings.

METHODS The sample consists of 8948 adults from the second wave of the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study, which is representative of the British population. The cross-sectional association between arts and cultural activities and allostatic load was tested with negative binomial models, and the mediation roles of alcohol consumption and smoking in the association was tested with the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) decomposition method. RESULTS Frequent participation in arts, frequent attendance of cultural events, visits to museums or galleries, and visits to historical sites have negative associations with allostatic load. The associations are mediated by lower frequency of alcohol drinking and smoking. CONCLUSIONS Cultural capital may promote health by reducing the frequency of health risk behaviors such as drinking alcohol and smoking.

As a consequence, many follow-up visits in patients with previously excised skin cancers were delayed. The aim of this retrospective real-life case-control study is demonstrating that delay in follow-up led to an increased incidence of advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers on the total of surgically excised skin cancers. METHODS: The incidence of excised advanced melanoma and keratinocyte cancers in our dermato-surgery division in the period May 18 to November 18, 2020, was compared to the same time span of 2019. All data were collected from the electronic database of our department. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to assess the risk of excised advanced skin cancers in 2020 compared to 2019. RESULTS: From May to November 2019, we performed 265 surgical excisions, while during the pandemic in 2020, we completed 280 surgeries. The number of advanced skin cancers excised between May 18 and November 18, 2020, was significantly higher compared with the same period in 2019 (54 vs. 22, OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.56-4.47; P = 0.0003). Significant differences were also observed regarding the number of surgically removed advanced BCCs (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.14-4.07; P = 0.0187) and advanced SCCs (OR 4.60; 95% CI 1.31-16.18; P = 0.0175). CONCLUSION: These results confirm that delay in follow-up and, consequently, postponed surgical excisions are related to an increased incidence of advanced skin tumors, resulting in poorer prognosis lifelong.

Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to consider the inhomogeneous transmission of the spread arising from a variety of reasons, like the distribution of local epidemic onset times or of the transmission rates. We show that these contributions can be incorporated into a susceptible-infected-recovered framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remaining uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of COVID-19 using real data from different countries, with an emphasis in the case of Mexico, and show that it also correctly describes the longtime dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak, and considerably improves the accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may prove to be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of the epidemics, thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","output":"Inhomogeneous Transmission and Asynchronic Mixing in the Spread of COVID-19 Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The design, implementation, and outcome of game-based learning for learners with disabilities have not been sufficiently examined systematically.

The secondary objectives of the presented study are to evaluate different outcomes of the rehabilitation program in comparison to standard of care regarding: functional performance at 4-week and 12-week post- discharge mark; health-related quality of life, the impact on the health services (namely days of hospitalization), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention proposed. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-arm clinical trial of treatment, with an allocation ratio 1:1 and framework of superiority. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Potential participants will be adult patients (18 years old) hospitalized in ICU with respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19, who are referred to respiratory and functional rehabilitation. Only patients approved by physical rehabilitation doctors to perform respiratory and functional rehabilitation will be considered potential participants. To be eligible for inclusion participants must have been independent in their activities of daily living before the onset of critical illness (verbal statement by their proxy) and have to meet the safety criteria defined by the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU, which involves assessment and treatment of the respiratory system and may include positioning, hyperinflation techniques and suctioning. The physical function of the patient is assessed, and active bed exercises and mobility are encouraged as soon as possible and may include sitting out of bed. The intervention group will receive a functional and respiratory multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol (that includes medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions) during their entire hospital stay. After reassurance that the patients fulfil the safety criteria, they will initiate the rehabilitation protocol, individualized to each patient based on the clinical status. The rehabilitation interventions and exercises implemented will be consistent with recommendations from the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. The intervention will occur 6 days per week (Monday to Saturday), fifteen minutes, twice per day for each participant. Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on the individuals tolerance and stability. After discharge, the intervention group will continue with rehabilitation exercises, prescribed by physical rehabilitation doctors. These exercises are designed for the patient to do at home, and then report their execution to rehabilitation nurses through teleconsultation, until 12 weeks after ICU discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES: Baseline descriptive data collection will include age, sex, comorbidities and date of admission to ICU. The need of mechanical ventilation and length of use, as well as the need for oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay (days/hours), incidence of ICU readmission, discharge destination and survival will also be recorded. Prior to intervention, every two days and at discharge, participants will be evaluated using the following scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment, 5 standardized questions for cooperation, Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test and Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. At discharge, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be functional capacity using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and it will be measured at discharge and at the 4-week and 12-week mark. Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will also be re-evaluated at the 4-week and 12-week mark. The health related quality of life will also be used as an outcome measure, using the 12-Item Short Form Survey, at 12 weeks of follow-up. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be divided into two groups, standard care and intervention, by means of balanced randomization at a 1:1 ratio using blocks of 10 participants. The randomization sequence is going to be created using a free software (http://www.randomized.org/). In order to ensure the confidentiality of the randomisation sequence, this process will be conducted by an assessor external to the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The evaluators in the study will be blinded during the entire process. The evaluators will be unaware of the study objectives and the randomized distribution of patients to study groups and will not have access to the randomization sequence. Although blinding for patients will not be possible to achieve completely, subjects will be unaware of other treatment modalities, and they will not know if they belong to the intervention or standard group. As for the treating physiotherapists and ICU staff, blinding will not be possible to achieve, but they will not be responsible for assessing outcomes. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to randomise 40 participants to each group. 80 participants in total.

METHODS: Data were collected using Twitter's Filtered Streams Interface, and included all publicly available tweets with the \\"#DoctorsSpeakUp\\" hashtag on March 5, 2020, the day of the event. Two independent coders assessed a 5% subsample of original tweets (n = 966) using a thematic content analysis approach. Cohen's &#954; ranged 0.71-1.00 for all categories. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between tweet sentiment, type of account, and tweet content (personal narrative and/or statement about research or science). Accounts were analyzed for likelihood of being a bot (i.e. automated account) using Botometer. RESULTS: Of 847 (87.7%) relevant tweets, 244 (28.8%) were authored by a Twitter user that identified as a parent and 68 (8.0%) by a user that identified as a health professional.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04).

Instead of fitting comfortably in the latters capacious tent, animal studies has chafed at environmentalists commitment to holistic communitarianism best represented by Aldo Leopolds land ethic. The land ethic approaches the biotic community as a pyramidal ecological system that turns on the relations between producers and consumers and between predators and prey rather than as an egalitarian moral community. Animal rights activists have thus repeatedly clashed with conservationists in an internecine fight poignantly dramatized in T.C. Boyles novel When the Killings Done (2011). In this paper, I argue that environmental justice cannot be secured solely from the third-person perspective of the deontological argument underlying animal rights or the utilitarian argument often used to justify the land ethic. Instead, we might draw on the pragmatist traditions East and West and view justice as a larger loyalty achieved as much by the moral imagination of the particular from the first- and second-person perspectives as by rational deliberation on the universal.

The study also summarizes nutritional recommendations to combat COVID-19 in different countries and territories as well as dietary sources of those key nutrients. Moreover, different nutritional intervention strategies based on different age groups, physiological and medical conditions were also included, and the challenges of nutritional interventions towards the care of COVID-19 patients are also discussed. Since the availability of a drug or vaccine is still uncertain, a balanced diet or nutrient therapy can be used as a robust strategy to combat COVID-19. Thus, we hope this review may help to make an informed decision with regard to diet choice both at individual level as well as clinical settings.","output":"Prospects of nutritional interventions in the care of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fast-spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant identified in the United Kingdom in December 2020 has raised international alarm.

This milestone coincides with the pandemic caused by COVID-19, putting in conflict notions of people's rights linked to the preservation of life and freedom presented by ECA itself. This article explores the reinventions and displacements resulting from the quarantine, which attend to people's right to life in a context where restrictions are imposed to their right to freedom. By assuming the inseparability of Michel de Certeau's concepts of 'strategy' and 'tactics', the article methodologically deals with six expressive scenes of a new practice of everyday life, which are linked, each one in its own way, to three specific dimensions: the families' relationship with technologies; the relationship of families with the school; and the relationship between families and their children. The four initial scenes, explored from the configuration of 'strategy', indicate efforts to shape the forms of social organization. In this case, it becomes evident how, on the one hand, the relationship of families with technology, and, on the other, the relationship of families with school, suggest practices that are committed to maintain ways of existence, even in the midst of a context of exceptionality. The last two scenes are based on the 'tactic' configuration and give visibility to everyday practices of families with children, which we view as ordinary people's reports that, through this very condition, suggest creative possibilities.","output":"The reinvention of everyday life in times of pandemic/ A reinven??o do cotidiano em tempos de pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed the modifying role of primary source of COVID-19 information in the association between knowledge and protective behaviors related to COVID-19 among adults living in the United States (US).

Inoculation of the allantoic cavity and use of allantoic fluid is a common method of passaging isolated avian influenza viruses. In the present study, 2490 fresh fecal samples and 4967 old fecal samples were investigated and subjected to conventional passaging (allantoic fluid method). Two newly developed methods-the allantochorion and allantoic fluid mixed method and the chick embryo and allantoic fluid mixed method-were also examined. The rates of influenza virus isolation for these three methods were compared. There appeared to be little difference among these methods when fresh fecal samples were used. However, for the old fecal samples, isolation rates for influenza virus were significantly higher for the chick embryo and allantoic fluid mixed method compared with the conventional allantoic fluid method. All viruses isolated using the conventional allantoic fluid method were isolated successfully using the two newly developed methods. These results suggest that using chick embryos in conjunction with allantoic fluid is effective for early virus isolation, especially for fecal samples that are not fresh. Additionally, practical chick embryo passage methods are described that improve significantly the rate of isolation of influenza viruses from fecal samples of migratory birds in a complex wild ecological environment.","output":"Improved methods for isolation of avian influenza virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Stable angina is ischemic chest pain on exertion or with emotional stress. Despite guideline-directed therapy, up to 30% of patients have suboptimal pain relief. The aims of this study were to: (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture; and (2) evaluate preliminary efficacy of acupuncture with respect to reduction of pain and increased functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS Participants with stable angina for ?1 month received either a standardized acupuncture protocol, twice per week for 5 weeks, or an attention control protocol. Measures included the McGill Pain Questionnaire (average pain intensity (API), pain now) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7 (functional status, symptoms, and HRQoL). Feasibility was defined as ?80% recruitment, ?75% retention following enrollment, and ?80% completion. Descriptive statistics and mixed-effects linear regression were used for analysis. RESULTS The sample (n = 24) had a mean age of 59  12 years, was predominantly female (63%), and represented minority groups (8% White, 52% Black, 33% Hispanic, and 8% Other). Feasibility was supported by 79% retention and 89% completion rates. The recruitment rate (68%) was slightly lower than expected. Acceptability scores were 87.9% for the acupuncture group and 51.7% for the control group. Outcomes were significantly better for the acupuncture versus control groups (API, b = -2.1 (1.1), p = 0.047; functional status, b = 27.6 (7.2), p < 0.001; and HRQoL, b = 38.8 (11.9), p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Acupuncture was feasible and acceptable in our diverse sample. We were slightly under the recruitment target of 80%, but participants who started the study had a high likelihood of completing it.

METHODS: Participants were 809 randomly selected patients admitted to the eight sampled hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and February 2021. We assessed and compared socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and clinical outcomes of the four regions. RESULTS: Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are a mean age of 60  17.7 years, 70% Saudi male, the prevalence of diabetes (DM2) 58%, hypertension (HTN) 48%, obesity 43%, cardiac diseases 15%, and immunity or cancer diseases almost 1%. The prevalence of complications during admission were bacterial pneumonia 65%, acquired respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 32%, sepsis 20%, multi-organ failure 18%, acute kidney diseases 15%, and arrhythmia 4%. Clinical outcomes were: admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) 52%, mortality rate 25%, referred to other facilities 9%, and mean length of stay (LOS) was 11 9.5 days. We observed statistically significant variation in many variables among the four regions. Najran and Aseer had a higher prevalence of risk factors for severity including age and comorbidities accompanied by higher rates of complications, ICU admissions, LOS, and mortality. Bisha and Jazan had lower prevalence of risk factors and LOS with lower rates of complications, ICU admissions, and mortality. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the geographic region in which the patient was cared for was related to the severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. Policy makers should search for solutions to regional differences in underlying health conditions such as DM2, HTN, and obesity to plan for improvements in preventive care as well as resource distribution to ensure quality for all Saudi citizens.

Patients with critically COVID-19 usually require invasive respiratory support, and the airway management is particularly important and the prognosis is poor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old man with an anastomotic fistula after radical treatment of esophageal cancer and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax was admitted with cough and dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax by pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test in combination with chest computed tomography (CT). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with antibiotics, antiviral and antibacterial medications, respiratory support, expectorant nebulization, and nutritional support. But he expressed progressive deterioration. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed since the onset of the type - respiratory failure on the 13th day of admission. The patient had persistent refractory hypercapnia after mechanical ventilation. Based on the treatment mentioned above, combined with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage by using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhalation solution, the patients refractory hypercapnia was gradually improved. OUTCOMES: The patient was cured and discharged after being given the mechanical ventilation for 26 days as well as 46 days of hospitalization, currently is surviving well. LESSONS: : Patients with severe conditions of novel coronavirus pneumonia often encounter bacterial infection in their later illness-stages. They may suffer respiratory failure and refractory hypercapnia that is difficult to improve due to excessive mucus secretion leading to small airway obstruction. This study provided a new insight on the proper treatment severe COVID-19 patients. The use of reasonable antibiotics and symptomatic respiratory support and other treatment, timely artificial airway and repeated bronchoalveolar NAC inhalation solution lavage, expectorant and other airway management are essential for such patients.","output":"Experience of N-acetylcysteine airway management in the successful treatment of one case of critical condition with COVID-19: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data regarding how the Delta variant of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & JohnsonCJanssen) vaccines at preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: We compared the effectiveness of the three vaccines during the pre- and post-Delta variant period (before and after 1 July 2021) in a large cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Michigan Medicine healthcare system. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) using 2 analyses: an inverse propensity weighted (IPW) Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis based on time from vaccination, and a Cox model based on calendar time with vaccination as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: Compared to Ad26.COV2.S recipients, the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in the post-Delta variant period was lower for BNT162b2 recipients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [.14C.98]; P = .05) and mRNA-1273 recipients (HR = 0.21; 95% CI: [.07C.64]; P = .006). Recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than Ad26.COV2.S recipients (HR = 0.6; 95% CI: [.43C.83]; P = .003) and BNT162b2 recipients (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: [.54C.76]; P < .001). After 1 July, efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection declined for Ad26.COV2.S recipients (VE = 76% before; VE = 49% after; P = .02), BNT162b2 recipients (VE = 87% before; VE = 52% after; P < .001), and mRNA-1273 recipients (VE = 92% before; VE = 70% after; P < .001). Waning immunity and the Delta variant contributed independently and significantly to this decline.

Overall, the mean age was 9.5 years (standard deviation 5.5C13.5), there were 67% males, median Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale score was 3 (interquartile range 3C4) and the most common injuries were fractures (n = 471, 38.8%). There were significantly more bike injuries presenting to the ED per month in the COVID group, 33.7(17.9) versus 84.5(61.4) (two\\\\tailed P value = 0.041). There was no statistical difference in severe injuries pre\\\\ versus post\\\\COVID (odds ratio 0.815 (95% confidence interval 0.611C1.088), P = 0.165). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in bicycle\\\\related injuries presenting to our ED during the pandemic, compared to previous years. Evaluating these trends will allow for the exploration of harm reduction strategies for preventing future bicycle\\\\related injuries.","output":"Bicycle injuries presenting to the emergency department during COVID\\\\19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We followed 45 participants in Surabaya, Indonesia, for 10 months and compared their PCR and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) results.

However, accurate information on the delivery of global health education (GHE) at a university level is lacking. This study aims to assess current GHE practices in U.K. universities, by identifying the availability of dedicated global health qualifications, as well as the breadth of inclusion of GHE topics across university course content. Methods Universities selected were the top 25 recipients of MRC funding in 2015-2016, as well as universities who were included in previous iterations of the Global Health League Table. We used the Consortium of Universities for Global Health GHE Competencies Toolkit to identify the presence of global health content across university global health and other course offerings. Universities were additionally judged on opportunities available in global health and on the presence of sustainable partnerships. Results Our results showed that 20 universities (74%) offer a post-graduate global health related course, with 9 (33%) offering an undergraduate global health related course. 13 (48%) were identified as centers of global health excellence. Just 12 (44%) universities had registered sustainable partnerships with Tropical Health and Education Trust. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was identified as the top deliverer of GHE, with the Universities of Leicester and Exeter joint bottom. We were unable to standardize quality assessments in this iteration of the project, but the release of student feedback to future assessors would help to improve the reliability of this study methodology. Additionally, much of our data was based on information available online, and thus some aspects of degree courses not published publicly may not have been accounted for in our scoring. Conclusion Those institutions wishing to improve their delivery of GHE should consider the establishment of a postgraduate or undergraduate degree course. Breadth of global health content across curricular was a major discriminating factor between institutions, and we would advise universities to consider including more global health topics across their curricular - especially in light of the intersectional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Global health education in U.K. universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic upended major facets of global society, including policing. This study describes three types of changes that police agencies in counties worldwide made. First, how have various domains of policing changed and how much did they change? Second, were these changes regulated by the official policy? Third, what are the potential consequences of the changes made during the pandemic? Taking a mixed-methods approach, our quantitative survey data from 27 countries, buttressed by qualitative responses, enable us to examine changes in these three areas. Our results suggest there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the degree of change, the use of policy to make the changes, and the perceived effects of the changes. Some changes (i.e., the use of personal protective equipment) are relatively ubiquitous and common sense based on the pandemic. Other organizational changes show a great deal more variation, especially when considering the valence of the change. Finally, the police executives from these countries express a highly optimistic?and potentially overly rosy?view of the potential longer term consequences of the pandemic or the operational changes made because of it. Overall, the results paint a more complicated picture of the responses to the pandemic made by the police organizations included in our sample.

In the context of day-to-day practice, clinical and preclinical studies, clinicians and basic researchers team up and continuously strive to increase insights into lung disease progression, diagnostic and treatment options. To unravel disease processes and to test novel therapeutic approaches, investigators typically rely on end-stage procedures such as serum analysis, cyto-/chemokine profiles and selective tissue histology from animal models. These techniques are useful but provide only a snapshot of disease processes that are essentially dynamic in time and space. Technology allowing evaluation of live animals repeatedly is indispensable to gain a better insight into the dynamics of lung disease progression and treatment effects. Computed tomography (CT) is a clinical diagnostic imaging technique that can have enormous benefits in a research context too. Yet, the implementation of imaging techniques in laboratories lags behind. In this review we want to showcase the integrated approaches and novel developments in imaging, lung functional testing and pathological techniques that are used to assess, diagnose, quantify and treat lung disease and that may be employed in research on patients and animals. Imaging approaches result in often novel anatomical and functional biomarkers, resulting in many advantages, such as better insight in disease progression and a reduction in the numbers of animals necessary. We here showcase integrated assessment of lung disease with imaging and histopathological technologies, applied to the example of lung fibrosis. Better integration of clinical and preclinical imaging technologies with pathology will ultimately result in improved clinical translation of (therapy) study results.","output":"From Mouse to Man and Back: Closing the Correlation Gap between Imaging and Histopathology for Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Practical guidance is needed regarding the vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals in resource-limited countries. It includes the number of vaccine doses that should be given to unvaccinated patients who experienced COVID-19 early in the pandemic. METHODS: We recruited COVID-19 convalescent individuals who received one or two doses of an mRNA vaccine within 6 or around 18 months after a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Their samples were assessed for IgG-binding or neutralizing activity and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variants of concern. RESULTS: A total of 43 COVID-19 convalescent individuals were analyzed in the present study. The results showed that humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variants of concern, including the Omicron variant, were comparable among patients vaccinated within 6 versus around 18 months. A second dose of vaccine did not significantly increase immune responses.

The SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model is a commonly used model to compute the simulations of any infectious viral diseases and was widely used before to model and simulate SARS, EBOLA, Spanish Flu, etc. This paper presents a modified SEIR model with additional parameters taken into consideration such as the death, recovered and recovered with the chance of being infected again, vaccination and control efficiency;where the control represents the effectiveness of the lockdown. This factor is being controlled in order to extend the projections into controlled death, recovery, and infection. Specific information including time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, ageing factor of the population, and resusceptibility with temporal immune response are also included in the model. After that, the model examines the outcome of the system after adding a controllable vaccine with taking into consideration the vaccination rate and vaccine's efficacy.

Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring on intensive care unit (ICU) day 2 or before, or after ICU day 2, respectively. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, AKI developed in 43 patients (51%). Twenty (24%) needed renal replacement therapy. Early and late AKI were found in 28 (33%) and 15 (18%) patients, respectively. Patients with AKI, as compared with patients without AKI, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and ICU mortality (72% versus 39%, p < 0.01) and presented on admission more marked cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematological dysfunction. Patients with early but not late AKI presented on admission higher APACHE II score and more marked organ dysfunction, as compared with patients without AKI.

Mobile-based apps on smartphones or tablets may facilitate the delivery of evidence-based therapy for child anxiety, thereby overcoming the access and engagement barriers of traditional treatment. Apps that deliver therapeutic content via immersive gaming technology could offer an effective, highly engaging, and flexible treatment proposition. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to describe a preliminary multi-method evaluation of Lumi Nova, a mobile app intervention targeting mild to moderate anxiety problems in children aged 7-12 years using exposure therapy delivered via an immersive game. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, user engagement and experience, and safety of the beta version of Lumi Nova. METHODS: Lumi Nova was co-designed with children, parents, teachers, clinicians, game industry experts, and academic partnerships. In total, 120 community-based children with mild to moderate anxiety and their guardians were enrolled to participate in an 8-week pilot study. The outcome measures captured the apps effectiveness (anxiety symptoms, child-identified goal-based outcomes, and functional impairment), user engagement (game play data and ease-of-use ratings), and safety (mood ratings and adverse events). The outcome measures before and after the intervention were available for 30 children (age: mean 9.8, SD 1.7 years; girls: 18/30, 60%; White: 24/30, 80%). Additional game play data were automatically generated for 67 children (age: mean 9.6, SD 1.53 years; girls: 35/67, 52%; White: 42/67, 63%). Postintervention open-response data from 53% (16/30) of guardians relating to the primary objectives were also examined. RESULTS: Playing Lumi Nova was effective in reducing anxiety symptom severity over the 8-week period of game play (t(29)=2.79; P=.009; Cohen d=0.35) and making progress toward treatment goals (z=2.43; P=.02), but there were no improvements in relation to functional impairment. Children found it easy to play the game and engaged safely with therapeutic content. However, the positive effects were small, and there were limitations to the game play data.

Although microglia were first described as ramified brain-resident phagocytes, research conducted over the past century has expanded considerably upon this narrow view and ascribed many functions to these dynamic CNS inhabitants. Microglia are now considered among the most versatile cells in the body, possessing the capacity to morphologically and functionally adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. Even in a resting state, the processes of microglia are highly dynamic and perpetually scan the CNS. Microglia are in fact vital participants in CNS homeostasis, and dysregulation of these sentinels can give rise to neurological disease. In this review, we discuss the exciting developments in our understanding of microglial biology, from their developmental origin to their participation in CNS homeostasis and pathophysiological states such as neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration, sterile injury responses, and infectious diseases.

Aims We aimed to determine the in-hospital outcome of patients with COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM). Materials and methods This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. We included patients diagnosed with CAM from a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. Clinical, laboratory, and in-hospital outcomes were noted. We analyzed factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Results Between February 2021 and June 2021, we identified 84 patients of CAM. The mean age was 49.3  12.1 years. Of the included patients, 64.3% had diabetes mellitus, and 83.3% had received steroids. Mucormycosis was diagnosed after a median of 11 days from the COVID-19 diagnosis. Orbital and central nervous system (CNS) involvement was seen in 29.8% and 23.8% of patients, respectively. During a mean hospital stay of 12.5  8.5 days, 15.5% of patients died. Compared to survivors, the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p<0.0001), orbital involvement (p=0.039), use of tocilizumab (p<0.0001), and development of renal dysfunction during hospitalization (p<0.0001) were seen in a significantly higher proportion of nonsurvivors. The proportion of patients with diabetes, those receiving steroids, and mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels did not differ significantly in survivors and nonsurvivors. Conclusion In-hospital mortality in CAM is relatively lower in our institution.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health burden of the Turkish population and vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the effects of social support. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We assessed depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and perceived social support among 894 people all over Turkey, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) two months after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey. RESULTS: According to DASS-21 subscale scores, the findings showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress-related symptoms was 24.8%, 21.9% and 12.6%, respectively. Female gender, being single, having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, lower education level and financial concerns were significantly associated with higher DASS-21 scores. Also, there was a negative correlation between all subgroups of perceived social support, especially from the family, and the total DASS-21 score.

Due to the lack of in-person activities, family medicine programs have utilized various social media platforms to connect with their applicants. In this paper, we describe how family medicine residency programs have adapted for the 2021 application cycle by using social media platforms. METHODS: We evaluated all family residency programs listed on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) for the presence of departmental and residency Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts. We reviewed programs' websites and social media posts for posts regarding virtual opportunities for prospective applicants. We noted family medicine virtual subinternship opportunities on the Visiting Student Application Service (VSAS). We collected data from October 17, 2020 through November 2, 2020. RESULTS: Of 675 identified family medicine residency programs, 372 (55%) had some form of social media presence. Open house opportunities were offered by 46 (6.8%) programs on Twitter, 60 (8.9%) programs on Instagram, and 64 (9.5%) programs on Facebook. One hundred ninety-five of 578 residency-specific accounts were created after March 1, 2020; Instagram accounts (103 of 195) represented most of these; five virtual subinternships were identified on VSAS.

However, one of the rare causes is periampullary or juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common in the general population, the overwhelming majority are asymptomatic. Duodenal diverticula can cause combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction through multiple mechanisms such as stasis-induced primary choledocholithiasis, stasis-induced intradiverticular enterolith, or longstanding diverticulitis, causing stenosing fibrosing papillitis or a combination of more than one of these mechanisms. Herein, I report a case of Lemmel syndrome due to a combination of multiple mechanisms and review the available literature on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and management of juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. PATIENT CONCERNS: Multiple episodes of abdominal pain, jaundice, anorexia, fever, and significant unintentional weight loss. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: Primary choledocholithiasis, recurrent ascending cholangitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic atrophy due to giant juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum, with unsuccessful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that was completely resolved after open transduodenal sphincteroplasty and septoplasty, transampullary and transcystic common bile duct exploration and stone extraction, and duodenal diverticular inversion. OUTCOME: Complete resolution of combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction without recurrence for 2 years after surgery. LESSONS: Surgeons should be aware of such rare syndromes to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed or inappropriate management. Furthermore, they should understand the different available operative options for cases that are refractory to endoscopic approach.","output":"Recurrent ascending cholangitis with acute pancreatitis and pancreatic atrophy caused by a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) mimicking the function of microbial CpG-dideoxynucleotides containing DNA (CpG-DNA) are potent immune stimuli. The immunostimulatory activity and the species-specific activities of a CpG-ODN depend on its nucleotide sequence properties, including CpG-hexamer motif types, spacing between motifs, nucleotide sequence, and length. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 is the cellular receptor for CpG-ODNs in mammalian species, while TLR21 is the receptor in avian species. Mammalian cells lack TLR21, and avian cells lack TLR9; however, both TLRs are expressed in fish cells. While nucleotide sequence properties required for a CpG-ODN to strongly activate mammalian TLR9 and its species-specific activities to different mammalian TLR9s are better studied, CpG-ODN activation of TLR21 is not yet well investigated. Here we characterized chicken and duck TLR21s and investigated their activation by CpG-ODNs. Chicken and duck TLR21s contain 972 and 976 amino acid residues, respectively, and differ from TLR9s as they do not have an undefined region in their ectodomain. Cell-based TLR21 activation assays were established to investigate TLR21 activation by different CpG-ODNs. Unlike grouper TLR21, which was preferentially activated by CpG-ODN with a GTCGTT hexamer motif, chicken and duck TLR21s do not distinguish among different CpG-hexamer motifs. Additionally, these two poultry TLR21s were activated by CpG-ODNs with lengths ranging from 15 to 31 nucleotides and with different spacing between CpG-hexamer motifs. These suggested that compared to mammalian TLR9 and grouper TLR21, chicken and duck TLR21s have a broad CpG-ODN sequence recognition profile. Thus, they could also recognize a wide array of DNA-associated molecular patterns from microbes. Moreover, CpG-ODNs are being investigated as antimicrobial agents and as vaccine adjuvants for different species. This study revealed that there are more optimized CpG-ODNs that can be used in poultry farming as anti-infection agents compared to CpG-ODN choices available for other species.","output":"Toll-Like Receptor 21 of Chicken and Duck Recognize a Broad Array of Immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide Sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hand osteoarthritis is a common and disabling problem without effective therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of local inflammation in causing pain and structural progression in hand osteoarthritis, and hand osteoarthritis with synovitis is a commonly encountered clinical phenotype. Methotrexate is a well-established, low-cost, and effective treatment for inflammatory arthritis with a well-described safety profile. The aim of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to determine whether methotrexate reduces pain over 6 months in patients with hand osteoarthritis and synovitis. METHODS: Ninety-six participants with hand osteoarthritis and synovitis will be recruited through the Osteoarthritis Clinical Trial Network (Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide, and Perth), and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either methotrexate 20 mg or identical placebo once weekly for 6 months. The primary outcome is pain reduction (assessed by 100 mm visual analogue scale) at 6 months. The secondary outcomes include changes in physical function and quality of life assessed using Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis, Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index, Health Assessment Questionnaire, Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, Short-Form-36, tender and swollen joint count, and grip strength, and structural progression assessed using progression of synovitis and bone marrow lesions from magnetic resonance imaging and radiographic progression at 6 months. Adverse events will be recorded. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat, including all participants in their randomised groups. DISCUSSION: This study will provide high-quality evidence to address whether methotrexate has an effect on reducing pain over 6 months in patients with hand osteoarthritis and synovitis, with major clinical and public health importance. While a positive trial will inform international clinical practice guidelines for the management of hand osteoarthritis, a negative trial would be highly topical and change current trends in clinical practice.

The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD) within its distal, prefusion S1 domain. The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on two recent and independent experimental structure publications. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called glue points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. The S2 proximal, fusion domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomers intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. This included, for example, a key RBD residue ARG357 in the Up-Down interaction and a three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522, associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer, acting as a stabilizing interaction with the NTD of its neighbor protomer. Additionally, our intra chain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant glue point or possible latch for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the amino acid R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. We conducted preliminary molecular dynamics simulations across 0.1  seconds to see if this latch provided structural stability and indeed found that a single point mutation (Q564G) resulted in the latch releasing transforming the protomer from the Down to the Up state conformation. Full trimeric Spike protein studies of the same mutation across all protomers, however, did not exhibit latch release demonstrating the critical importance of interchain interactions across the S1 domain, including RBD-NTD neighboring chain interactions. Therapies aimed at disrupting these noncovalent interactions could be a viable route for the physico-chemical mitigation of this deadly virion.","output":"Static all-atom energetic mappings of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and dynamic stability analysis of Up versus Down protomer states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine has been widely implemented during the COVID-19 global pandemic to enable continuity of care of chronic illnesses.

Data were obtained from daily reports and are represented as number (and percentage) of cases/100,000 persons. A lockdown with movement restrictions, especially across Regions, was declared at day 20. At day 81, 219,070 cases (363/100,000 persons) were diagnosed. A regression analysis based on the Gompertz model predicts a total number 233,606 cases (386/100,000 persons) at the end of the epidemic. The 21 areas, divided into Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, showed a wide range in the frequency of cases at day 81 (58-921, median 258/100,000 persons) and total predicted cases (58-946, median 267/100,000 persons). Similarly, the predicted time for the end of the wave of the epidemic (considering as surrogate marker the time at which 99% of the total cases are predicted to occur) was highly variable, ranging from 64 to 136 (median 99) days. We analyzed the impact of local and interventional variables on the epidemic curve in each Region. The number of cases correlated inversely with the distance from the area in which first cases were detected and directly also with the gross domestic product pro capite (as a marker of industrial activity) of the Region. Moreover, an earlier start of the lockdown (i.e. in the presence of a lower number of cases) and wider testing were associated with a lower final number of total cases.

The organizational consequences of quarantine/isolation are absence of organized training and competition, lack of communication among athletes and coaches, inability to move freely, lack of adequate sunlight exposure, and inappropriate training conditions. The reduction of mobility imposed to contain the advance of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic can negatively affect the physical condition and health of individuals leading to muscle atrophy, progressive loss of muscle strength, and reductions in neuromuscular and mechanical capacities.

We performed multiple linear regressions and path analysis to examine the relationship between rural status and behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, information appraisal, knowledge, variety of information source use, and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. Findings: Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to perform preventive behaviors, more likely to hold a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of performing preventive behaviors, and more likely to have lower levels of information appraisal skills. We identified information appraisal as a significant factor that might contribute to the rural/urban differences in preventive behaviors against COVID-19 through attitude, subjective norms, and intention. We found no rural/urban differences in behavioral intention, subjective norms, knowledge about preventive behaviors, or the variety of interpersonal/media source use.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the temporal trend in the use of opioid and nonopioid pain medications from a national survey. METHODS: Using data from the 2001 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examined the current use of prescription analgesics in the past 30 days among 50,201 respondents aged 20 years or older. Joinpoint regressions were used to test statistically meaningful trends of opioid vs nonopioid analgesics. RESULTS: The mean percentage of people who had pain medications in the past 30 days was 6.4% (5.3%-7.1%) for opioid and 11.3% (9.0%-14.8%) for nonopioid analgesics. The availability of opioid and nonopioid prescriptions at home has remained stable, except for the slight decline of opioids among cancer-free patients in 2005 to 2018. The most frequently used opioid analgesic medications included hydrocodone/acetaminophen, tramadol, and hydrocodone. CONCLUSION: We uniquely measured the proportion of people who had opioid and nonopioid pain medications at home in the United States and supplemented the previous knowledge of prescription rates mainly obtained from claims data.","output":"Temporal trend of opioid and nonopioid pain medications: results from a national in-home survey, 2001 to 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on stock market returns in Indonesia stock exchange.

The current indispensable challenge lies in the development of universal virus repudiation systems that are reusable, and capable of inactivating pathogens, thus reducing risk of infection and transmission. In this review, science-based methods, mechanisms, and procedures, which are implemented in obtaining resultant antiviral coated substrates, used in the destruction of the strains of the different viruses, are reviewed. The constituent antiviral members are classified into a few broad groups, such as polymeric materials, metal ions/metal oxides, and functional nanomaterials, based on the type of materials used at the virus contamination sites. The action mode against enveloped viruses was depicted to vindicate the antiviral mechanism. We also disclose hypothesized strategies for development of a universal and reusable virus deactivation system against the emerging COVID-19. In the surge of the current, alarming scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is a great necessity for developing highly-innovative antiviral agents to work against the viruses. We hypothesize that some of the antiviral coatings discussed here could exert an inhibitive effect on COVID-19, indicated by the results that the coatings succeeded in obtaining against other enveloped viruses. Consequently, the coatings need to be tested and authenticated, to fabricate a wide range of coated antiviral products such as masks, gowns, surgical drapes, textiles, high-touch surfaces, and other personal protective equipment, aimed at extrication from the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Science-Based Strategies of Antiviral Coatings with Viricidal Properties for the COVID-19 Like Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and rapid proliferation of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a global pandemic, with over 6,000,000 cases and nearly 400,000 deaths reported worldwide by the end of May 2020. A rush to find a cure prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis--vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the noncovalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease in its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.","output":"The Utility of Native MS for Understanding the Mechanism of Action of Repurposed Therapeutics in COVID-19: Heparin as a Disruptor of the SARS-CoV-2 Interaction with Its Host Cell Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a global priority and the best hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

Potential viral entry sites were investigated by histochemistry using tagged recombinant viral S protein on 52 ocular tissue samples including specimens of the cornea, conjunctiva, lid margin, lacrimal gland tissue, retina, choroid, and RPE.

With the outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, this transition moment can worsen with frequent, long-lasting lockdown and associated academic disruption. To help this young population, researchers are increasingly relying on smartphones and wearables, such as smartwatches, to continuously monitor students' daily lives to identify various factors that can affect students' phone call patterns associated with their health and well-being and academic success. In this work, we use different visualizations and statistical techniques to find various geographical places and temporal factors that affect students' phone call patterns (in terms of phone call duration and frequency) to foster the design and delivery of future smartphone-based health interventions using predictive models;thereby, potentially helping students adjust to college life with or without the presence of an emergency, such as pandemic that adversely impacts academic calendar and student life.

The suspected interspecies transmission of SARSr-CoVs from bats to humans has caused two severe CoV pandemics, the SARS pandemic in 2003 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The receptor utilization of SARSr-CoV plays the key role in determining the host range and the interspecies transmission ability of the virus. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor. Previous studies showed that WIV1 strain, the first living coronavirus isolated from bat using ACE2 as its receptor, is the prototype of SARS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and WIV1 is responsible for ACE2 binding and medicates the viral entry. Comparing to SARS-CoV, WIV1 has three distinct amino acid residues (442, 472, and 487) in its RBD. This study aimed at exploring whether these three residues could alter the receptor utilization of SARSr-CoVs. We replaced the three residues in SARS-CoV (BJ01 strain) S with their counterparts in WIV1 S, and then evaluated the change of their utilization of bat, civet, and human ACE2s using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus infection system. To further validate the S-ACE2 interactions, the binding affinity between the RBDs of these S proteins and the three ACE2s were verified by flow cytometry. The results showed that the single amino acid substitution Y442S in the RBD of BJ01 S enhanced its utilization of bat ACE2 and its binding affinity to bat ACE2. On the contrary, the reverse substitution in WIV1 S (S442Y) significantly attenuated the pseudovirus utilization of bat, civet and human ACE2s for cell entry, and reduced its binding affinity with the three ACE2s. These results suggest that the S442 is critical for WIV1 adapting to bats as its natural hosts. These findings will enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of coronaviruses, contributing to the prediction and prevention of coronavirus epidemics.","output":"The 442th amino acid residue of the spike protein is critical for the adaptation to bat hosts for SARS-related coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunological memory is the ability of the adaptive immune system to ensure a persistent protective effect after immunization.

Some of the countries with a low COVID-19 mortality are those with a relatively high consumption of traditional fermented foods. To test the potential role of fermented foods in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of fermented vegetables, pickled/marinated vegetables, fermented milk, yoghurt and fermented sour milk. We obtained the COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for data on potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people older than 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models - with log of population as an offset - to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only fermented vegetables reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g/day increase in the average national consumption of fermented vegetables, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by 35.4% (95% CI: 11.4%, 35.5%).

Our aim was to decrease the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy through an education intervention. METHOD: An education intervention, consisting of a PowerPoint presentation addressing the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccine concerns/myths and a question and answer panel comprising health care providers from various specialties, was implemented to address vaccine hesitancy among personnel associated with Wright-Patterson Air Force Base through a series of virtual and in-person seminars. Participants completed a post-seminar survey as a retrospective self-assessment to identify attitudes and views surrounding vaccine hesitancy and the impact of the education intervention. Chi-squared test was used to examine relationships between categorical variables, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for vaccine hesitancy pre- and post-seminar. All analyses were done using SPSS Statistics Version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Institutional Review Board approval was not obtained before this study as it began as a non-research initiative and received non-research determination post hoc. RESULTS: Five hundred participants completed the survey. Mean age was 44.7 years with 13.4 and 86.6% medical and non-medical personnel, respectively. Nearly all (98.8%) had not received their first shot of the vaccine series. 402 (80.9%) were receptive to vaccination, and 95 (19.1%) were hesitant post-seminar. Of the 139 participants who reported they were initially hesitant after our intervention, 50 (36%) indicated that they were now receptive to the vaccine, while 89 (64%) remained hesitant. Of those 50, 48 (96%) had moderate to great amount of trust in COVID-19 vaccine information presented by physicians/other providers. Six respondents who wanted the vaccine before the intervention no longer wanted the vaccine. A medical occupation (OR = 4.85, 95% CI = 2.63-8.96, P < .001), little or no trust in COVID-19 vaccine information from physicians/other providers (OR = 19.48, 95% CI = 7.31-51.90, P < 0.001), and being age 30 or younger (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.02-3.2, P = 0.041) were independent predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Trust in providers was a significant factor in change of intent from vaccine hesitant to receptive post-intervention (OR 0.13, 95% CI = 0.03-0.59, P = .008). Age and occupation were not significant factors associated with change in intent. CONCLUSION: Our education intervention was effective in reducing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a military base population.

The patients were divided into 2 groups with noncritical illness and critical illness regarding severity status within the hospitalization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with SARS-COV-2. The ROC curves were performed to compare the prediction performance of different factors.A total of 180 adult patients in this study included 20 critical patients and 160 noncritical patients. In univariate logistic regression analysis, 15 risk factors were significantly associated with critical outcomes.

With the exception of a few pathological situations, MCs are usually present at relatively low frequencies in most tissues. Since their first description, MCs in tissues were identified mostly using their morphological characteristics and their typical coloration when stained with aniline dyes. However, increasing availability of highly specific antibodies now permits the use of fluorescence-based flow cytometry as the method of choice for the quantification, characterization, and purification of cells in suspension. This technique allows for a rapid analysis of thousands of events and for the identification of cells present at frequencies as low as one event in 106 unwanted cells. This method also permits for simultaneous characterization of multiple antigens at a single cell level, which is ideal in order to study rare populations of cells like MCs. Here we describe the basis of flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping applied to the study of MC.

The transmembrane C-type lectins human dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its mouse homolog SIGN-R1 are distributed in LRs and expressed on splenic marginal zone (MZ) macrophages. The DC-SIGN-C1q or SIGN-R1-C1q complex could mediate the immunoglobulin (Ig)-independent classical complement pathway against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Precise roles of LRs during this complement pathway are unknown. Here we show that LRs are indispensable for accelerating the DC-SIGN- or SIGN-R1-mediated classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae, thus facilitating rapid clearance of the pathogen. The trimolecular complex of SIGN-R1-C1q-C4 was exclusively enriched in LRs of splenic MZ macrophages and their localization was essential for activating C3 catabolism and enhancing pneumococcal clearance, which were abolished in SIGN-R1-knockout mice. However, DC-SIGN replacement on splenic MZ macrophages LRs of SIGN-R1-depleted mice reversed these defects. Disruption of LRs dramatically reduced pneumococcal uptake and decomposition. Additionally, DC- SIGN, C1q, C4, and C3 were obviously distributed in splenic LRs of cadavers. Therefore, LRs on splenic SIGN-R1(+) or DC-SIGN(+) macrophages could provide spatially confined and optimal bidirectional platforms, not only for usual intracellular events, for example recognition and phagocytosis of pathogens, but also an unusual extracellular event such as the complement system. These findings improve our understanding of the orchestrated roles of the spleen, unraveling a new innate immune system initiated from splenic MZ LRs, and yielding answers to several long-standing problems, including the need to understand the profound role of LRs in innate immunity, the need to identify how such a small portion of splenic SIGN-R1(+) macrophages (<0.05% of splenic macrophages) effectively resist S. pneumoniae, and the need to understand how LRs can promote the protective function of DC-SIGN against S. pneumoniae in the human spleen.","output":"Dominant role of splenic marginal zone lipid rafts in the classical complement pathway against S. pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until vaccination for the SARS CoV-2 becomes a reality, it appears that the infection is here to stay.

Accordingly, this makes ACE2 research essential for understanding the zoonotic nature of coronaviruses and identifying novel drugs. Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators.

A prime example is the transcript isoform switch that leads to the read-through expression of the long non-coding RNA NEAT1_2, at the expense of the shorter polyadenylated transcript NEAT1_1. NEAT1_2 is required for assembly of paraspeckles (PS), nuclear bodies that protect cancer cells from oncogene-induced replication stress and chemotherapy. Searching for proteins that modulate this event, we identified factors involved in the 3' end processing of polyadenylated RNA and components of the Integrator complex. Perturbation experiments established that, by promoting the cleavage of NEAT1_2, Integrator forces NEAT1_2 to NEAT1_1 isoform switching and, thereby, restrains PS assembly. Consistently, low levels of Integrator subunits correlated with poorer prognosis of cancer patients exposed to chemotherapeutics. Our study establishes that Integrator regulates PS biogenesis and a link between Integrator, cancer biology, and chemosensitivity, which may be exploited therapeutically.","output":"Integrator restrains paraspeckles assembly by promoting isoform switching of the lncRNA NEAT1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, basic public health precautions must be taken across settings and populations.

A comparative analysis of both forms of Mpro was carried out to elucidate the binding site architectural differences in the presence and absence of '13b'. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the presence of '13b' enhances the stability of Mpro than the unbound APO form. The N- and C- terminals of both the protomers stabilize each other, and making it's interface essential for the active form of Mpro. In comparison to monomer, the relatively high affinity of '13b' is gained in dimer pocket due to the high stability of the pocket by the interaction of S1 residue of chain B with residues F140, E166 and H172 of chain A, which is absent in monomer.

However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing. MAIN BODY: Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative. Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use. This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use. Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy. Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the \\"viral program\\". Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.

Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning.

It then proposes liturgical temporality as an alternative to 24/7 temporality, framing it as a fitting context for the cultivation of solidarity between human beings and between human beings and the natural world. It argues that modern Jewish and Christian theologies of Sabbath-keeping as a mode of liturgical and ethical praxis have articulated a liberative vision for shared liturgical temporality but have not paid sufficient attention to concrete, collective modes of liturgical time keeping that could contend with the all-encompassing reality of 24/7 life. It concludes by discussing three ways that a more robust spirituality and praxis of liturgical time could support the cultivation of solidarity: a sense of the present that is mindful of the past and future, the invitation of practitioners into a shared story, and meaningful repetition toward the appropriation of a vision of redemption and liberation for human and non-human life.

IFITM3 was previously shown to disrupt cholesterol trafficking, but the functional relationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol remains unclear. We previously showed that inhibition of IAV entry by IFITM3 is associated with its ability to promote cellular membrane rigidity, and these activities are functionally linked by a shared requirement for the amphipathic helix (AH) found in the intramembrane domain (IMD) of IFITM3. Furthermore, it has been shown that the AH of IFITM3 alters lipid membranes in vitro in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between IFITM3 and cholesterol in more detail. Using a fluorescence-based in vitro binding assay, we found that a peptide derived from the AH of IFITM3 directly interacted with the cholesterol analog, NBD-cholesterol, while other regions of the IFITM3 IMD did not. In addition, a peptide spanning a putative cholesterol recognition motif proximal to the transmembrane domain of IFITM3 exhibited minor cholesterol binding activity. Importantly, previously characterized mutations within the AH of IFITM3 that strongly inhibit antiviral function (F63Q and F67Q) disrupted AH structure and inhibited cholesterol binding. Our data suggest that direct interactions with cholesterol may contribute to the inhibition of membrane fusion pore formation by IFITM3.

Data on clinical and CT features were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Four children were included in the current study. All of them were asymptomatic throughout the disease course (ranging from 7 days to 15 days), and none of them showed abnormalities in blood cell counts. Familial cluster was the main transmission pattern. Thin-section CT revealed abnormalities in three patients, and one patient did not present with any abnormal CT findings. Unilateral lung involvement was observed in two patients, and one patient showed bilateral lung involvement. In total, five small lesions were identified, including ground-glass opacity (n = 4) and consolidation (n = 1). All lesions had ill-defined margins with peripheral distribution and predilection of lower lobe.

On the other hand, COVID-19 has a direct impact on the circulatory and respiratory systems as it causes a failure to some human organs or severe respiratory distress in extreme circumstances. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is extremely important for the medical community to limit its spread. For a large number of suspected cases, manual diagnostic methods based on the analysis of chest images are insufficient. Faced with this situation, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have shown great potential in automatic diagnostic tasks. This paper aims at proposing a fast and precise medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) that can distinguish COVID-19 precisely in chest-X-ray images. This MDSS uses a concatenation technique that aims to combine pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) depend on the transfer learning (TL) technique to build a highly accurate model. The models enable storage and application of knowledge learned from a pre-trained CNN to a new task, viz., COVID-19 case detection. For this purpose, we employed the concatenation method to aggregate the performances of numerous pre-trained models to confirm the reliability of the proposed method for identifying the patients with COVID-19 disease from X-ray images. The proposed system was trialed on a dataset that included four classes: normal, viral-pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19 cases. Various general evaluation methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

At the same time, the livestock sector plays a strategic role in improving the economic, environmental, and sociocultural stewardship of any nation. The cow (Bos indicus) has held a distinctive role in human history ever since its domestication because of its valued harvests like dairy products (milk, clarified butter, yogurt, curd, and buttermilk) excreta like dung and urine. These products, except dung, provide all the necessary energy and nutrients to ensure the proper growth and development of the human. They are the source of many bioactive substances, which possess immense pharmacotherapeutic action against various physiological, metabolic and infectious disorders, including COVID-19.

There is an urgent need to develop sensitive and online methods for on-site diagnosing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the huge development of Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) provides an impressive solution to this problem. In this paper, we proposed a 5G-enabled fluorescence sensor for quantitative detection of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 by using mesoporous silica encapsulated up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@mSiO2) labeled lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). The sensor can detect spike protein (SP) with a detection of limit (LOD) 1.6 ng/mL and nucleocapsid protein (NP) with an LOD of 2.2 ng/mL. The feasibility of the sensor in clinical use was further demonstrated by utilizing virus culture as real clinical samples. Moreover, the proposed fluorescence sensor is IoMT enabled, which is accessible to edge hardware devices (personal computers, 5G smartphones, IPTV, etc.) through Bluetooth. Medical data can be transmitted to the fog layer of the network and 5G cloud server with ultra-low latency and high reliably for edge computing and big data analysis. Furthermore, a COVID-19 monitoring module working with the proposed the system is developed on a smartphone application (App), which endows patients and their families to record their medical data and daily conditions remotely, releasing the burdens of going to central hospitals.

Most of the evaluated drugs against SARS-CoV-2 derive from drug repurposing of Food and Drug Administration-approved molecules. These drugs have as target three major processes: (1) early stages of virus-cell interaction, (2) viral proteases, and (3) the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. SUMMARY: This review focused on the basic principles of virology and pharmacology to understand the importance of early stages of virus-cell interaction as therapeutic targets and other main processes vital for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, we focused on describing the main targets associated with SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy and the rationale of drug combinations for efficiently suppressing viral replication. Key Messages: We hypothesized that blocking of both entry mechanisms could allow a more effective antiviral effect compared to the partial results obtained with chloroquine or its derivatives alone. This approach, already used to achieve an antiviral effect higher than that offered by every single drug administered separately, has been successfully applied in several viral infections such as HIV and HCV. This review will contribute to expanding the perception of the possible therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the benefits of using combination therapies.","output":"Understanding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Replication to Design Efficient Drug Combination Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: As teaching hospitals institute social distancing and defer non-emergent procedures to cope with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the need for daily onsite presence, unless necessary has been reduced for all medical staff including trainees.

I argue that complete labelling is a related but separate principle which has not received any explicit attention from commentators. Whereas fair labelling focuses, usually, on the protection of defendants rights, the principle of complete labelling explains and justifies whether the labels attached appropriately represent the nature and scale of the wrong done to the community. As a case study, I apply this lens in the context of regional (U.S./Mexican) criminal justice responses to crimes against humanity perpetrated by drug-cartels in the context of the Mexican Drug War. Successive administrations in Mexico and the U.S. have tended to charge cartel leaders (and/or their political supporters) with so-called transnational crimes (for example, drug-trafficking, money-laundering, bribery/corruption). This is despite the fact that many of the most powerful cartels have controlled territory, attacked entire towns, carried out acts of terror, and disappeared thousands of people. The principle of complete labelling is useful in normative terms because it helps in the critical examination of a States prosecutorial practices, exposing problems that might otherwise be missed. In relation to the case study discussed, for example, a focus on complete labelling helps to expose the regional prosecutorial policy as either an unjustified exercise in selectivity or, at worst, an expression of collective denial. After considering certain counteracting reflexions which speak to some of the foundational anxieties of international criminal justice, the article concludes that domestic prosecutions for crimes against humanity in the context of drug-cartels may, sometimes, be justified.","output":"Complete Labelling and Domestic Prosecutions for Crimes Against Humanity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has impacted numerous matters and medical education is one of them.

These findings raise the question of the role of cell factors associated with early stages of the viral infection in host selectivity. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2). Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to prime the viral spike for its interaction with its receptor. GRP78 has also been proposed as a possible co-receptor. In this study, we used several bioinformatics approaches to bring clues in the interaction of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and GRP78 with SARS-CoV-2. We selected several mammalian hosts that could play a key role in viral spread by acting as secondary hosts (cats, dogs, pigs, mice, and ferrets) and evaluated their predicted permissiveness by in silico analysis. Results showed that ionic pairs (salt bridges, N-O pair, and long-range interactions) produced between ACE2 and the viral spike has an essential function in the host interaction. On the other hand, TMPRSS2 and GRP78 are proteins with high homology in all the evaluated hosts. Thus, these proteins do not seem to play a role in host selectivity, suggesting that other factors may play a role in the non-permissivity in some of these hosts. These proteins represent however interesting cell targets that could be explored in order to control the virus replication in humans and in the intermediary hosts.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 host tropism: an in silico analysis of the main cellular factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To achieve efficient and environmental reuse of waste ribbons, artworks reconstructed from waste ribbons for decorative occasions were inspired by the dedicated and determined people working against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and developed through a handmade and delicate strategy.

This study examined changes in and predictors of adolescent mental health from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States. METHODS: Participants include 238 adolescents (132 males; ages 15-17; 118 with ADHD). Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. RESULTS: Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre-COVID-19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities were at-risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay-at-home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors. Results and clinical implications should be considered within the context of our predominately White, middle class sample.","output":"Prospective impact of COVID-19 on mental health functioning in adolescents with and without ADHD: protective role of emotion regulation abilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pharmacological management of COVID-19 has evolved significantly and various immunomodulatory agents have been repurposed.

In tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an implicit trade-off between the economy and the reduction in the number of cases and deaths by the virus. If governmental restrictions to combat the pandemic are very strong, the economy could be seriously damaged. Conversely, if restrictions are very mild to minimize economic losses, it would be very difficult to stop the spread of the virus. It is necessary to find an optimization model to support government decisions balancing the impacts of COVID-19 in health and economic aspects. In this paper, we propose a methodology to find out the optimal number of days per contingency phase, in such a way that public health is prioritized and the damage to the economic impact is reduced. Then, our methodology is applied to one of the most densely populated areas in the world, Mexico City. Our methodology uses an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) model to simulate the evolution of the pandemic, and it can be implemented utilizing either a genetic algorithm or a Deep Q-Learning algorithm. For the experiments, we propose two scenarios in which the number of days for each phase is predicted within a 120-day period. The first experiment guarantees that the number of beds is not exceeded, considering the economic impact less relevant. By contrast, the second experiment reduces the number of days in which beds are exceeded as long as the economic losses are not higher than 20%, prioritizing the economy.

As patients who have it age, their upper airway obstruction may worsen. Therefore, they typically require several surgeries throughout their lives to correct specific facial abnormalities. Anesthetic and airway management of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome can be challenging for anesthesia providers, especially in ambulatory settings. CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old patient with Treacher Collins syndrome presented to our outpatient surgery center for midface fat grafting. He had undergone multiple surgical procedures at Nationwide Childrens Hospital, which is affiliated with The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. A decision was made to proceed with the grafting surgery after: (1) the literature was thoroughly reviewed; (2) multidisciplinary planning had been done utilizing our comprehensive preoperative screening and assessment process; (3) the scope of care at our ambulatory surgery center, the patients medical history, and relevant airway notes had been reviewed; (4) the case was discussed with the surgeon; and (5) relevant images of the patient had been gathered. Evaluation of the patients airway on the day of surgery was reassuring and a plan for managing a potentially difficult airway had been developed. After anesthetic induction, mask ventilation without adjuvants was successful. Video and direct laryngoscopy (for purposes of education) revealed grade 1 views. Supraglottic airway device placement resulted in an effective seal and the remainder of the surgery and the patients subsequent course were uneventful.

We argue for inhibition of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in COVID-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier.

To test whether optical monitoring (OM) can detect decrements in CBF producing cerebral hypoxia, we applied the OM technique continuously to probe brain-injured patients who also had invasive brain tissue oxygen (PbO2) monitors. METHODS Comatose patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 8) were enrolled in an IRB-approved protocol after obtaining informed consent from the legally authorized representative. Patients underwent 6-8 h of daily monitoring. Brain PbO2 was measured with a Clark electrode. Absolute CBF was monitored with DCS, calibrated by perfusion measurements based on intravenous indocyanine green bolus administration. Variation of optical CBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline was measured during periods of brain hypoxia (defined as a drop in PbO2 below 19 mmHg for more than 6 min from baseline (PbO2 > 21 mmHg). In a secondary analysis, we compared optical CBF and MAP during randomly selected 12-min periods of \\"normal\\" (> 21 mmHg) and \\"low\\" (< 19 mmHg) PbO2. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression analysis were employed to assess the utility of optical CBF, MAP, and the two-variable combination, for discrimination of brain hypoxia from normal brain oxygen tension. RESULTS Seven patients were enrolled and monitored for a total of 17 days. Baseline-normalized MAP and CBF significantly decreased during brain hypoxia events (p < 0.05). Through use of randomly selected, temporally sparse windows of low and high PbO2, we observed that both MAP and optical CBF discriminated between periods of brain hypoxia and normal brain oxygen tension (ROC AUC 0.761, 0.762, respectively). Further, combining these variables using logistic regression analysis markedly improved the ability to distinguish low- and high-PbO2 epochs (AUC 0.876).

PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the incidence of major bleeding in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) within a single health system with COVID-19 versus ORVI. In the COVID-19 cohort, we assessed the effect of anticoagulation intensity received on ICU admission on bleeding risk. We performed a secondary analysis with anticoagulation intensity as a time-varying covariate to reflect dose changes after ICU admission. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-three and 387 patients were included in the COVID-19 and ORVI cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio of major bleeding for the COVID-19 cohort relative to the ORVI cohort was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.86). In COVID-19 patients, an inverse-probability treatment weighted model found therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation on ICU admission had an adjusted hazard ratio of bleeding of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.88-2.73) compared with standard prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.

Although gender differences in surgical technical ability is not known, studies have shown gender differences in visuospatial ability and manual dexterity. We devised a study to assess objectively the quality of final product of small bowel anastomosis in male and female novice surgeons to explore differences in surgical technical ability. METHODS Thirty-six novice surgeons in the final year of medical school with minimal surgical experience were taught surgical knot tying and small bowel suturing. The students were asked to complete 7 small bowel anastomosis in 7 separate sessions. The quality of the final product was assessed looking at the \\"fine details\\" (number of sutures and accuracy, ie, ratio of sutures piercing the full thickness of the bowel) and the \\"gross apposition\\" of the bowel ends at the anastomotic site. A grading system for apposition was devised to assess apposition. RESULTS The results with fine details and accuracy of suturing revealed that female surgeons were significantly better in the fourth to the sixth sessions with no gender difference in the number of sutures placed. With gross apposition at the anastomotic ends, male surgeons were consistently better between the third to the sixth session. However, these differences were eliminated with training. CONCLUSIONS Known gender differences in visuospatial ability and manual dexterity may explain the initial gender differences in the quality of the final product. However, these differences were not present by the end of the training sessions. Therefore, with training, no difference in surgical technical ability was found between male and female novice surgeons.","output":"Differences in final product of a bowel anastomosis of male and female novice surgeons."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.

We identify a piecewise analysis of three different periods, identified based on trends of both positive confirmation and clinical recovery of COVID-19. As expected, the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically during the exponential increase of incidences. However, our in-depth analysis shows that there is a shift in the age-group of incidences to the younger population, and the recovery-period of the younger population is considerably lower. Here, we have estimated the recovery rate to be 0.125. Overall, the prognosis of COVID-19 indicates an improvement in recovery rate owing to the government-mandated practices of restricted mobility of the older population and aggressive contact tracing.","output":"ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL RECOVERY-PERIOD AND RECOVERY RATE ESTIMATION OF THE FIRST 1000 COVID-19 PATIENTS IN SINGAPORE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The October 2020 issue of Rhinology is a very interesting edition as it illustrates how world-wide colleagues pave the way for a better future of patients affected by nose and sinus diseases.

This study investigated the regional three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the AT during conditioning. Eighteen ATs were scanned using 3D freehand ultrasound during 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50%) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions. Longitudinal strain was assessed for the whole AT, aponeurosis, and free AT and transverse strain was assessed for the proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions of the free AT. Longitudinal conditioning of the whole AT was primarily driven by creep response of the free AT and transverse conditioning was greatest for the mid-portion of the free AT. Whole and free AT longitudinal strain increased up to the third contraction and were accompanied by a corresponding reduction in free AT cross-sectional area (CSA) strain in proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions. No significant changes in aponeurosis strain or tendon volume were detected between contractions. These findings suggest that conditioning alters free AT shape, with increased tendon length attained at the expense of reduction in free AT CSA. Although AT experiences different amounts of strain in different regions, the number of contractions required to reach steady-state strain during conditioning is uniform throughout the tendon.","output":"Regional three-dimensional deformation of human Achilles tendon during conditioning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 Pandemic Policy Monitor (COV-PPM) prospectively documents the measures taken to contain SARS-Cov-2 transmission across countries in EU27, EEA and UK.

There was no study showing syphilis serostatus and its related factors among pregnant women in the current study area. This study was aimed to assess the magnitude of syphilis serostatus and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jinka town public health facilities. METHOD: Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted in Jinka town public health facilities, southern Ethiopia from the 1(st) July to the 1(st) September, 2020. A systematic sampling technique was used to select 629 study subjects. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews and records were reviewed to check syphilis test results. Data were coded and entered by using Epi-data version 4.432 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. The binary logistic regression model was used to investigate factors associated with syphilis. A p-value of < 0.05 at multivariable analysis was considered statistically significant. RESULT: In this study, syphilis sero-prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics was 4.8% (95% CI: 3.12, 6.48). Rural residence [AOR: 2.873; 95%CI (1.171, 7.050)], alcohol use [AOR: 3.340; 95% CI (1.354, 8.241)] and having multiple sexual partner [AOR: 5.012; 95% CI (1.929, 13.020)] were statistically significantly associated with syphilis. CONCLUSION: Sero-prevalence of syphilis was high. Being a rural residence, having multiple sexual partners, alcohol use were factors associated with syphilis. Therefore, substantial efforts have to be made to provide regular health education for pregnant women at the antenatal clinic on the avoidance of risky behaviors and the risk of syphilis on their pregnancy.","output":"Magnitude of syphilis sero-status and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jinka town public health facilities, Southern Ethiopia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Objectives The massive outbreak of Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has turned out to be a serious global health issue worldwide Currently, no drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19 The current computational study was attempted to identify a novel therapeutic inhibitor against novel SARS-CoV-2 using in silico drug discovery pipeline Methods In the present study, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was the target for the designing of drugs against the deadly virus The 3D structure of the receptor was modeled & validated using a Swiss-model, Procheck & Errat server A molecular docking study was performed between a group of natural & synthetic compounds having proven anti-viral activity with ACE2 receptor using Autodock tool 1 5 6 The molecular dynamics simulation study was performed using Desmond v 12 to evaluate the stability and interaction of the ACE2 receptor with a ligand Results Based on the lowest binding energy, confirmation, and H-bond interaction, cinnamic acid (?5 20 kcal/mol), thymoquinone (?4 71 kcal/mol), and andrographolide (Kalmegh) (?4 00 kcal/mol) were screened out showing strong binding affinity to the active site of ACE2 receptor MD simulations suggest that cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide (Kalmegh) could efficiently activate the biological pathway without changing the conformation in the binding site of the ACE2 receptor The bioactivity and drug-likeness properties of compounds show their better pharmacological property and safer to use Interpretation & Conclusions The study concludes the high potential of cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide against the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor protein Thus, the molecular docking and MD simulation study will aid in understanding the molecular interaction between ligand and receptor binding site, thereby leading to novel therapeutic intervention","output":"A molecular dynamics simulation study of the ACE2 receptor with screened natural inhibitors to identify novel drug candidate against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Smoking status does not indicate the amount or length of tobacco use, and thus, it is an imperfect measure to assess the association between cigarette smoking and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. This investigation assessed whether cigarette smoking status, intensity of smoking (i.e., average daily packs of cigarettes smoked), duration of smoking, and pack-years of smoking are associated with severe outcomes among adults diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which we identified consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the University of Cincinnati healthcare system between 13 March 2020 and 30 September 2020 who had complete information on smoking status, severe COVID-19 outcomes, and covariates (i.e., demographics and comorbidities). We used logistic regression to evaluate the associations of smoking status and intensity of smoking with COVID-19 severity, defined as hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or death, adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbidities. Results: Among the 4611 COVID-19 patients included in the analysis, 18.2% were current smokers and 20.7% were former smokers. The prevalence of COVID-19 outcomes was 28.9% for hospitalization, 9.8% for ICU admission, and 1.4% for death. In the adjusted analysis, current smoking (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02C1.49), former smoking (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07C1.54), and pack-years of smoking (AOR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02C1.17) were associated with a higher prevalence of hospitalization.

Conclusions: Smoking status, pack-years, and intensity of smoking were associated with hospitalizations in patients with COVID-19 and intensity of smoking was associated with ICU admission.

PURPOSE The primary purpose of this study was to analyze if the DOS has any effect on clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING A post hoc analysis was performed on an original prospective clinical study analyzing clinical outcomes and cervical sagittal alignment correlations. PATIENTS SAMPLE Fifty-eight patients undergoing one- or two-level ACDF surgeries for cervical degenerative radiculopathy were analyzed. OUTCOME MEASURES Standardized questionnaires were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. Neck and arm pain was evaluated using (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]). Two scales of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (Short-Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36]) were used for this study: the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Neck disability index (NDI) was used to evaluate chronic disability in activities of daily living. The patients completed a self-reported Patient Satisfaction with Results Survey. METHODS Patients who had previous or redo surgeries, were diagnosed with myelopathy or had more than two-level ACDF surgeries were excluded, leaving a total of 58 patients. The mean follow-up was 37.2 months (range 12-54). Patients were divided into two groups for clinical outcome analyses according to the DOS: patients who had surgery within 6 months (n=29) or more than 6 months (n=29) after becoming symptomatic. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic or clinical parameters among the patient groups. Controlling for preoperative scores, the patients who had surgery within 6 months reported significantly higher reduction (p=.04) in arm pain scores compared with the patients who waited more than 6 months. No significant differences were detected in postoperative neck pain VAS (p=.3), NDI (p=.06), SF-36 PCS (p=.08), and MCS (p=.8) scores. CONCLUSIONS Neck and upper extremity pain can be successfully treated conservatively.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that the European populations slightly differ in alternative allele frequencies at the 2,754 variant sites in ACE2 identified in the gnomAD database. We find that the Southern European population has a lower frequency of missense variants and slightly higher frequency of regulatory variants.

We also show that the Russian population is similar to other European populations when comparing the frequencies of the ACE2 variants. Evaluation of the effect of various classes of ACE2 variants on COVID-19 outcome in a cohort of Russian patients showed that common missense and regulatory variants do not explain the differences in disease severity.

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, little attention is paid to construction safety, resulting in severe accidents. To prevent construction accidents and learn to how address safety issues in future pandemics, this study proposed an improved STAMP (Systems Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes) model to analyze the collapse accident of the Xinjia Express Hotel used for COVID-19 quarantine in China. Through the application of the STAMP approach, the causes of the construction accident and the relationship between various causal factors are analyzed from a systematic perspective. The identified causes are divided into five categories: contractors, management of organizations, technical methods, participants, and interactive feedback. Finally, safety recommendations are drawn from this study to improve construction safety and safety management in pandemics.","output":"Construction Safety during Pandemics: Learning from the Xinjia Express Hotel Collapse during COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Parental stress is a known risk factor for coercive parenting and for lower coparenting quality. In the present study, we examined whether and how changes in parental stress of mothers and fathers from the pre-COVID-19 period (T1) into the height of the first lockdown in the Netherlands (T2) were linked to changes in coercive parenting of mothers and fathers and to changes in coparenting quality. A total of 96 families (46.9% lower or medium and 53.1% higher educational background), with mother, father, and child (53.1% girls; T1: M age = 3.44 years, SD = 0.32; T2: M age = 4.72 years, SD = 0.61) participated. To examine interrelations between parental stress (reported using the Parental Stress Scale), coparenting, and coercive parenting (both reported using the Parenting And Family Adjustment Scales), a multivariate Latent Change Score (LCS) model was employed. Higher initial levels of parental stress were associated with higher initial levels of coercive parenting and lower initial levels of coparenting quality. Similarly, stronger increases in parental stress were associated with stronger increases in coercive parenting and with stronger decreases in coparenting quality. Directions of associations and effect sizes were similar for mothers and fathers in all analyses. The results from the present study indicate the importance of a family systems perspective in prevention and intervention programs. Promotion of systematic family-based preventive and intervention activities by the government might support families during challenging times, as during the novel COVID-19 pandemic.

Using the cross-sectional study design with a large sample size (N = 30,275) from the mobile health App users in Japan, we show age-dependent lifestyle changes during a nonpunitive mild lockdown (from April to May 2020). RESULTS: Sleep onset and offset were delayed on work-days but not on free-days with increased sleep duration and decreased social jetlag, and the changes were more evident in the younger population. Although average weight change was close to none because of the users characteristic (95% of App users try to lose weight), we investigated an association between lifestyle change and body-weight change. Participants who reported advanced sleep phase during mild lockdown described a weight decrease. In contrast, the delayed sleep phase reported a weight gain. The results were significant after adjustment of confounding factors including physical activity and meal changes. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is cumulative evidence showing a relationship between late chronotype and obesity, it is still unclear about the potential benefit of the chronotype management to control body weight. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association between chronotype and weight changes by leveraging a large cohort.","output":"Changes in sleep phase and body weight of mobile health App users during COVID-19 mild lockdown in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) forced the governing bodies across the world to ban all kinds of travel involving the movement of people. However, the policymakers have been working hard to mobilize the movement of essential goods and services considering its importance in containing the pandemic. It signifies how important the establishment and maintenance of logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) operations are, both during the containment and the successive periods. Motivated with the paramount importance of LSCM operations during the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe, this paper critically reviews the existing literature closely related to it. The main aim is to identify and enhance the understanding of the logistical characteristics that play a vital role during pandemics. The selection of the literature was done using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. The classification of the selected literature was done using a tripartite framework. Results show that researchers have focused mostly on Post-event (48.24%) management of logistical operations followed by the Pre-event (31.76%) and least in the Integrated (20%.) approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of the results provided useful insights that are discussed in detail. Also, twelve key areas have been identified that need due attention to improve the overall efficiency of the LSCM operations. We believe that the findings from this paper would be useful to the decision-makers and other stakeholders, as far as, maintaining efficient LSCM operations during as well after the pandemics are concerned.","output":"Maintaining efficient logistics and supply chain management operations during and after coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: learning from the past experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Several COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in the US, yet preliminary evidence suggests high levels of vaccine hesitancy and wide racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in uptake. OBJECTIVE: To assess COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health care personnel (HCP) during the first 4 months of availability in a large academic hospital, compare acceptance with previously measured vaccine hesitancy, and describe racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in vaccine uptake. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 12 610 HCP who were offered COVID-19 vaccination at a major academic hospital in Philadelphia between December 16, 2020, and April 16, 2021. EXPOSURES: For each HCP, data were collected on occupational category, age, sex, race and ethnicity (Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American [Black], Hispanic, White, and multiracial), and social vulnerability index (SVI) at the zip code of residence. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccine uptake by HCP at the employee vaccination clinic. RESULTS: The study population included 4173 men (34.8%) and 7814 women (65.2%) (623 without data). A total of 1480 were Asian or Pacific Islander (12.4%); 2563 (21.6%), Black; 452 (3.8%), Hispanic; 7086 (59.6%), White; and 192 (1.6%), multiracial; 717 had no data for race and ethnicity. The mean (SD) age was 40.9 (12.4) years, and 9573 (76.0%) received at least 1 vaccine dose during the first 4 months of vaccine availability. Adjusted for age, sex, job position, and SVI, Black (relative risk [RR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.66-0.72) and multiracial (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89) HCP were less likely to receive vaccine compared with White HCP. When stratified by job position, Black nurses (n = 189; 62.8%), Black HCP with some patient contact (n = 466; 49.9%), and Black HCP with no patient contact (n = 636; 56.3%) all had lower vaccine uptake compared with their White and Asian or Pacific Islander counterparts. Similarly, multiracial HCP with some (n = 26; 52.0%) or no (n = 48; 58.5%) patient contact had lower vaccine uptake. In contrast, Black physicians were just as likely to receive the vaccine as physicians of other racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, more than two-thirds of HCP at a large academic hospital in Philadelphia received a COVID-19 vaccine within 4 months of vaccine availability. Although racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities were seen in vaccine uptake, no such disparities were found among physicians. Better understanding of factors driving these disparities may help improve uptake.","output":"Factors Associated With COVID-19 Vaccine Receipt by Health Care Personnel at a Major Academic Hospital During the First Months of Vaccine Availability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now become a worldwide pandemic bringing over 71 million confirmed cases, while the specific drugs and vaccines approved for this disease are still limited regarding their effectiveness and adverse events. Since virus incidences are still on rise, infectivity and mortality may also rise in the near future, natural products are highly considered to be valuable sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. This present review aims to comprehensively summarize the up-to-date scientific literatures on biological activities of plant- and mushroom-derived compounds relevant to mechanistic targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory-associated pathogenesis, including viral entry, replication and release, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Experimental procedure: Data were retrieved from a literature search available on PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases and collected until the end of May 2020. The findings from in vitro cell and non-cell based studies were considered, while the results of in silico studies were excluded. Results and conclusion: Based on the previous findings in SARS-CoV studies, except in silico molecular docking analysis, herein, we provide a total of 150 natural compounds as potential candidates for development of new anti-COVID-19 drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the existing therapeutic agents. Several natural compounds have showed their promising actions on multiple therapeutic targets, which should be further explored. Among them, quercetin, one of the most abundant of plant flavonoids, is proposed as a lead candidate with its ability on the virus side to inhibit SARS-CoV spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction, viral protease and helicase activities, as well as on the host cell side to inhibit ACE activity and increase intracellular zinc level.","output":"Anti-COVID-19 drug candidates: A review on potential biological activities of natural products in the management of new coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outpatient neurosurgery is rising popularity leading to patients satisfaction and cost-savings. Although several North-American teams have shown the safety of outpatient stereotactic brain biopsies, few data from other countries with different health care systems are available. We therefore conducted a feasibility and safety study on the outpatient stereotactic brain biopsies. We prospectively examined all the consecutive stereotactic brain biopsies performed in an outpatient setting at our tertiary medical center, between June 2018 and September 2020. Among the 437 patients who underwent stereotactic brain biopsy during the study period, 40 (9.2%) patients were enrolled for an outpatient management. The sex ratio was 1 and the median age on biopsy day was 55 [41C66] years. The median distance from patients home to hospital was 17 km [3C47]. 95% of patients had pre-biopsy ASA score of 1 or 2 and mRs equal to 2 or less. The rate of same-day discharge was 100%. No patient experienced post-biopsy symptomatic complication necessitating readmission within the month following the biopsy. One patient (2.5%) resorted to an unplanned consultation. Histological findings obtained from brain biopsy led to a diagnosis in all patients; the most frequently found were neoplastic lesions (77.5%). Stereotactic brain biopsies can therefore be safely achieved on an outpatient setting in carefully selected patients. This process could be more widely adopted in other neurosurgical centers, without affecting the quality of patients health care and safety.

Aim To review the quality of fit test records and provide an overview of the outcome of fit testing of UDC staff. Method Audit of fit test records for FFP3 respirators against Health and Safety Executive standards. Results Six percent of records had missing or incomplete data and 6% of fit test records required follow-up. Of 583 people fit tested with an FFP3 respirator, 80.6% (470/583) passed the test and 19.4% (113/583) failed. Of those, 479 individuals were fitted with a 3M 1873V respirator, of which 82.7% (396/479) passed the test and 17.3% (83/479) failed. Discussion The audit enabled efficient resolution of problems associated with fit testing, informed learning needs and highlighted that a significant proportion of individuals are unable to wear certain makes/models of respirators.

METHODS We tested the possibility of a fast-track protocol in 51 consecutive patients (mean age 65  12 years) transferred from spokes centres or from the field to our HUB centre and admitted to our coronary care unit (CCU). Once the patient had arrived in the cath lab, the nasopharyngeal swab was performed. The real-time PCR to extract RNA for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed with an automated rapid molecular Xpert Xpress test. Meanwhile, coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if necessary. RESULTS In this fast-track protocol, the time to perform nasopharyngeal swab was 11  11 min; time spent to transport nasopharyngeal swab to the laboratory was 29  20 min; time to detect viral nucleic acid was 68  16 min. The overall time from the execution of nasopharyngeal swab to the result was 109  26 min. The results were immediately put into the hospital computer system and made readily available. Depending on the test result, patients were then transferred to the regular CCU or Covid area. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that 0-1.5 h fast-track triage for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is feasible in patients with ACS. The execution of nasopharyngeal swab in the cath lab and its analysis with a rapid molecular test allows rapid stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Fast-track ruling in/out SARS-CoV-2 infection with rapid 0/1.5 h molecular test in patients with acute coronary syndromes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bulk tank milk samples from 1070 dairy herds in England and Wales were tested by ELISA for antibodies to bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV).

None of the herds had less than 40 dairy cows and none had been vaccinated against BVDV. The prevalence of BVDV antibody-positive herds in the national population was estimated at 95 per cent and approximately 65 per cent of the herds had a high level of bulk tank antibody suggestive of recent infection with BVDV. Dairy herds in East Anglia and the south-east of England had a significantly lower risk of being BVDV antibody-positive than herds in the rest of England and Wales. However, these regional differences tended to diminish with increasing herd size. Around 69 per cent of the herds were BHV-1 antibody-positive and all the herds were antibody positive to BRSV and BCV.

Adherence to the home quarantine may put children at risk by missing routine vaccination. In this study, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 on child routine immunization in a rural area of Bangladesh and consider the broader implications. Data for this study comes from the Chakaria Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) of icddr,b with a population of 90,000 people residing in 16,000 households in 49 villages in a rural, coastal area of Southeast Bangladesh. We used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design which involved two phases between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020: first, we observed 258 outreach sessions of 86 EPI centers. We calculated the number of Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) outreach sessions suspended and the number of children who missed their routine vaccination due to the COVID-19. We extrapolated the number of Bangladeshi children who missed their routine vaccination using Chakaria HDSS observations. Secondly, we conducted in-depth interviews to explain the quantitative results. The EPI outreach session (EOS) declined to 74.42% (95% CI 63.97C83.22), 10.45% (95% CI 5.00C18.94), and 3.45% (95% CI 1.00C9.75) from 2019 levels in March, April, and May 2020, respectively. By extrapolation, in Bangladesh, between March and May 2020, 3.2 million children missed their scheduled vaccination compared to 2019. Results from in-depth interviews showed that the unwillingness of villagers to hold EOS and the absenteeism of the vaccinators due to social distancing recommendations and lack of personal safety measures were the main reasons for the discontinuation of the EOS. Resuming EPI outreach sessions and introducing a special catch-up program is essential to prevent future outbreaks and deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases in Bangladesh and the countries where children missed their routine vaccination due to COVID-19.

Understanding the volume and nature of such presentations is key to future resource allocation and guideline creation. Methods Surgical handovers from a 9-week period from the commencement of the first government restriction of non-essential travel (March 8th-May 10th 2020) were studied. A corresponding time period of usual surgical activity (March 10th-12th May 2019) was studied for comparison. Results During the pandemic period, 447 referrals (mean age 54, 4.9% COVID-19 positive) were received representing a 16.5% decrease compared to 2019 (n=521). The most common referral in each period was abdominal pain (n=255 vs 259). The duration of symptoms prior to admission and overall number of traumas did not differ between the periods. Fewer referrals for traumatic brain injuries and polytraumas and more symptomatic hernias, cellulitis and blocked/dislodged lines/tubes were seen during the pandemic. Conclusion The volume of surgical referrals and admissions was significantly decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traumas and abdominal pain were unaffected. An increase in several referrals for which patients would typically visit their general practitioner or have an expedited hospital appointment was seen.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Online testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may contribute to overcoming barriers to traditional testing such as stigma and inconvenience. However, regulation of these tests is lacking, and the quality of services is variable, with potential short- and long-term personal, clinical and public health implications. This study aimed to evaluate online tests available in the UK against national standards. Methods: Providers of online STI tests (self-sampling and self-testing) in the UK were identified by an internet search of Google and Amazon (June 2020). Website information on tests and care was collected, and further information requested from providers via an online survey, sent twice (July 2020, April 2021). The information obtained was compared to British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for diagnostics and standards of STI management. Results: 31 providers were identified: 13 self-test, 18-self-sample, and two laboratories that serviced multiple providers. Seven responded to the online survey. Many conflicts with national guidelines were identified, including: lack of health promotion information, lack of sexual history taking, use of tests licensed for professional use only marketed for self-testing, inappropriate infections tested for, incorrect specimen type used, and lack of advice for post-diagnosis management. Conclusions: Very few online providers met the BASHH national STI management guidelines standards that were assessed, and there is concern that this will also be the case in areas that were not covered by this study. For-profit providers were the least compliant, with concerning implications for patient care and public health. Regulatory change is urgently needed to ensure that online providers are compliant with national guidelines to ensure high-quality patient care, and providers are held to account if non-compliant.","output":"Online tests for sexually transmitted infections - Friend or Foe?

As the fourth most populous nation in the world, Indonesia is predicted to face a big threat to this pandemic particularly Jakarta as the epicentre of the virus in Indonesia. However, the nature of COVID-19 that can easily spread and also many undetected cases that do not present symptoms make it more difficult to determine the real mortality effects of COVID-19.The deaths in Jakarta from the new coronavirus may be higher than officially reported.

METHODS: Within a large, well-phenotyped, diverse, prospective cohort of subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infection and historical controls derived from cohorts with high prevalence of viral coinfections and samples taken during prior flu seasons, we measured SARS-CoV-2 serological responses (both IgG and IgM) using commercially available assays. We calculated sensitivity and specificity, relationship with disease severity and mapped the kinetics of antibody responses over time using generalised additive models. RESULTS: We analysed 1,001 samples from 752 subjects, 327 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (29.7% with severe disease) spanning a period of 90 days from symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower (44.1-47.1%) early (<10 days) after symptom onset but increased to >80% after 10 days. IgM positivity increased earlier than IgG-targeted assays but positivity peaked between day 32 and 38 post onset of symptoms and declined thereafter, a dynamic that was confirmed when antibody levels were analysed, with more rapid decline observed with IgM. Early (<10 days) IgM but not IgG levels were significantly higher in those who subsequently developed severe disease (signal / cut-off 4.20 (0.75-17.93) versus 1.07 (0.21-5.46), P=0.048).

However, the systematically planned or unplanned implementation of sudden lockdown across the globe, including India, has pushed the migrant workers into huge troubles. Without savings and transport systems, food security and other problems pushed migrant workers to walk to home from working places covering over 1000 km. Walking under the hot sun with heavy luggage and child in the womb or arm has affected the lactating mothers or pregnant women the most. The objective of this review article was to analyse the problems faced especially by the women migrant workers in India in order to point out and to adapt future strategies for their protection. METHODS: All published relevant literature from scientific sources and reputed news channels are considered to write the current review. RESULTS: Tremendous adverse effects of COVID-19 have been observed at social/cultural/religious/economic levels and other sectors of the society albeit its huge progressive but temporary effects are also observed on environment. The environment is self-regenerating, while the economy is pushed to an unseen manner. This is because many countries including India have adopted social lockdowns as a measure of prevention against the highly contagious disease. The results of lockdowns are encourageable as far as the reduced infection and death rate is concerned. For example, India being the second largest populous country with less advanced healthcare system is enjoying a comparatively low rate of death in COVID-19. However, sudden lockdowns followed by shutdowns mediated by industrial closure have pushed many migrant workers to walk to home by passing over even >1000 kilometres of distance on barefoot. Without transport systems, proper food and medications, many migrant workers faced un-imaginary difficulties, and some of them have also died on the way. Pregnant women and lactating mothers were also in the list and found to face unseen problems while migrating to their home from their working places with a load of child in the womb or on arm. So, phronesis of such problems and hierarchical strategies are suggested. CONCLUSION: Since such zoonotic pandemics cannot be avoided in the near future, solid future strategies must be adopted by different nations especially under developed and poor countries to tackle the problem of the migrant workers including the pregnant women and the lactating mothers.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak Challenges in Indian Migrant Pregnant and Lactating Mothers: Learnt Lesson Demands Phronesis and Hierarchical Strategies for Such Future Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges inherent to the serological detection of a novel pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be used diagnostically and for surveillance, but their usefulness depends on their throughput, sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a multiplex fluorescent microsphere-based assay, 3Flex, that can detect antibodies to three major SARS-CoV-2 antigens-spike (S) protein, the spike ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP). Specificity was assessed using 213 pre-pandemic samples. Sensitivity was measured and compared to the Abbotta?? ARCHITECTa?? SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay using serum samples from 125 unique patients equally binned (n = 25) into 5 time intervals (&#8804;5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, and &#8805;21 days from symptom onset). With samples obtained at &#8804;5 days from symptom onset, the 3Flex assay was more sensitive (48.0% vs. 32.0%), but the two assays performed comparably using serum obtained &#8805;21 days from symptom onset. A larger collection (n = 534) of discarded sera was profiled from patients (n = 140) whose COVID-19 course was characterized through chart review. This revealed the relative rise, peak (S, 23.8; RBD, 23.6; NP, 16.7; in days from symptom onset), and decline of the antibody response. Considerable interperson variation was observed with a subset of extensively sampled ICU patients. Using soluble ACE2, inhibition of antibody binding was demonstrated for S and RBD, and not for NP.

Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and Amphan cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by Amphan. The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of Kharif (monsoon) rice production, current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders.","output":"Multi-faceted impact and outcome of COVID-19 on smallholder agricultural systems: Integrating qualitative research and fuzzy cognitive mapping to explore resilient strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Collection of respiratory cultures for airway microbiology surveillance is an essential component of routine clinical care in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 yrs). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 yrs). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For 4 individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated new growth of P. aeruginosa.

Its prevalence among individuals with clinical suspicion of fungal rhinosinusitis has been reported in approximately 20% in subtropical populations, unlike North America with a prevalence of 0.5%. It is typically associated with Aspergillus flavus and the presence of noncaseating granulomas or Langerhans giant cells on histopathologic examination. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of a patient with clinical history of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of intense cephalalgia, visual impairment, palpebral ptosis, and limitation of extraocular movements. MRI demonstrated the presence of opacification of paranasal sinuses, and a left intraconal abscess. A surgical endoscopic approach was performed and histopathologic examination revealed frontal GCIFR and maxillary fungus ball. Treatment with IV azoles provided adequate clinical response. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The spectrum of the fungal rhinosinusitis disease is not clear. However, non-invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is not often found concomitantly with invasive types. GCIFR typically manifests with an indolent and gradual progression at early stages. Advanced stages can exhibit orbital and intracranial involvement leading to visual impairment, frequent relapses, and a poor prognosis. A higher incidence of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection despite an unremarkable medical history, associated with immune dysregulation. CONCLUSION: GCIFR is a rare condition with few cases reported in America.

Although a large body of data has been published regarding the so-called first wave of the pandemic, little is known about the characteristics and predictors of worse outcomes of patients managed in IMUs during the second wave. METHODS: We prospectively assessed demographics, comorbidities, treatment and outcomes, including ventilation support (VS) and death, in patients admitted to our IMU for SARS-CoV-2 between October 13th, 2020 and January 21st, 2021. Clinical evolution and biochemical testing 1, 7 and 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis were recorded. RESULTS: We studied 120 patients (M/F 56/64, age 7114.5 years) admitted to our IMU. Most of them had at least one comorbidity (80%). Patients who died were older, more frequently underweight, affected by malignant neoplasms and on statin therapy compared to patients eventually discharged. Both worse outcome groups (VS and death) presented higher neutrophils, ferritin, IL-6 and lower total proteins levels than controls. Age was significantly associated with mortality but not with VS need. The multivariate analysis showed age and gender independent association of mortality with underweight, malignancy and antibiotics use at the admission.

Furthermore, infection metrics are unlikely to illustrate the full scope of negative consequences of the pandemic and its associated risk to communities. METHODS: In an effort to better understand the impacts of COVID-19, we concurrently assessed the geospatial and longitudinal distributions of Twitter messages about COVID-19 which were posted between March 3rd and April 13th and compared these results with the number of confirmed cases reported for sub-national levels of the United States. Geospatial hot spot analysis was also conducted to detect geographic areas that might be at elevated risk of spread based on both volume of tweets and number of reported cases. RESULTS: Statistically significant aberrations of high numbers of tweets were detected in approximately one-third of US states, most of which had relatively high proportions of rural inhabitants.

The pressure to produce drugs and vaccines against the ongoing pandemic has resulted in the use of some drugs such as azithromycin, chloroquine (sulfate and phosphate), hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. However, reports from some of the clinical trials with these drugs have proved detrimental on some COVID-19 infected patients with side effects more of which cardiomyopathy, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, macular retinopathy, and hepatotoxicity have been recently reported. Realizing the need for potent and harmless therapeutic compounds to combat COVID-19, we attempted in this study to find promising therapeutic compounds against the imminent threat of this virus. In this current study, 16 derivatives of gallic acid were docked against five selected non-structural proteins of SARS-COV-2 known to be a good target for finding small molecule inhibitors against the virus, namely, nsp3, nsp5, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14. All the protein crystal structures and 3D structures of the small molecules (16 gallic acid derivatives and 3 control drugs) were retrieved from the Protein database (PDB) and PubChem server respectively. The compounds with lower binding energy than the control drugs were selected and subjected to pharmacokinetics screening using AdmetSAR server. RESULTS: 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) gave binding energy values of - 8.4, - 6.8, - 8.9, - 9.1, and - 7.5 kcal/mol against Mpro, nsp3, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp15 respectively. Based on the ADMET profile, 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) was found to be metabolized by the liver and has a very high plasma protein binding. CONCLUSION: The result of this study revealed that 4-O-(6-galloylglucoside) could be a promising inhibitor against these SAR-Cov-2 proteins.

However, its impact is clearly inherent to the local stroke network conditions. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care in the Lyon comprehensive stroke center during this period. Methods: We conducted a prospective data collection of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) during the COVID-19 period (from 29/02/2020 to 10/05/2020) and a control period (from 29/02/2019 to 10/05/2019). The volume of reperfusion therapies and pre and intra-hospital delays were compared during both periods. Results: A total of 208 patients were included. The volume of IVT significantly decreased during the COVID-period (55 (54.5%) vs 74 (69.2%);p=0.03) and was mainly due to time delay among patients treated with MT. The volume of MT remains stable over the two periods (72 (71.3%) vs 65 (60.8%);p=0.14) but the door-to-groin puncture time increased in patients transferred for MT (237 [187-339] vs 210 [163-260];p<0.01). The daily number of Emergency Medical Dispatch calls considerably increased (1502 [1133-2238] vs 1023 [960-1410];p<0.01). Conclusions: Our study showed a decrease of the volume of IVT, whereas the volume of MT remained stable although intra-hospital delays increased for transferred patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On the eve of 2020, when the whole world was celebrating the new year, the virus was unleashing and conquering new territories, minute by minute. So, how come a small virus that is said to have originated from Wuhan, China was able to create such a big havoc? How did a flu-like-symptom virus was able to shackle economies and change the world we live in? What caused Governments to announce relief, fiscal and economic packages to prevent the large-scale economic collapse? The response lies in the way the virus made man-kind to live in the new world. Social distancing was the new norm that led to fewer interactions among people. Next, mass scale shut downs announced by the governments led to closure of financial markets, stock exchanges, corporate offices, exchange of trade as well as several events.

How might COVID-19 vaccines alter selection for increased SARS-CoV-2 virulence? Framing current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 vaccines in the context of evolutionary theory indicates that prospects for virulence evolution remain uncertain. However, differential effects of vaccinal immunity on transmission and disease severity between respiratory compartments could select for increased virulence. To bound expectations for this outcome, we analyse an evo-epidemiological model. Synthesizing model predictions with vaccine efficacy data, we conclude that while vaccine-driven virulence remains a theoretical possibility, the risk is low if vaccines provide sustained robust protection against infection. Furthermore, we found that any increases in transmission concomitant with increases in virulence would be unlikely to threaten prospects for herd immunity in a highly immunized population. Given that virulence evolution would nevertheless impact unvaccinated individuals and populations with low vaccination rates, it is important to achieve high vaccination rates worldwide and ensure that vaccinal immunity provides robust protection against both infection and disease, potentially through the use of booster doses.","output":"Assessing the risk of vaccine-driven virulence evolution in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wratil et al. find specific antibody responses against seasonal human coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, to be elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic blood donors.

Due to over-exploitation and habitat loss, the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined and are unable to meet market demand. A number of measures have been taken to try to reduce the impact that this large and growing market for TCM may have on wild animal species. Consumer preferences and behavior are known to play an important role in the consumption and protection of wild animals used in traditional medicine, and thus are likely to be an important factor in the success of many of these mechanismsparticularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners). In this study we conducted questionnaires and designed stated preference experiments embodying different simulation scenarios using a random sample of the population in Beijing to elicit individuals knowledge, perceptions and preferences toward wild or farmed animal materials and their substitutes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We found that respondents had a stated preference for wild materials over farm-raised and other alternatives because they believe that the effectiveness of wild-sourced materials is more credible than that of other sources. However, we also found that, although respondents used TCM products, they had a poor understanding of the function or composition of either traditional Chinese medicines or proprietary Chinese medicines (PCM), and paid little attention to the composition of products when making purchasing decisions. Furthermore, awareness of the need for species protection, or conservation consciousness was found to play an important role in willingness to accept substitutions for wild animal materials, while traditional animal medicinal materials (TAMs) derived from well-known endangered species, such as bear bile and tiger bone, show relatively higher substitutability. These results suggest that there is still hope for conservation measures which seek to promote a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients and provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.","output":"Perception, Price and Preference: Consumption and Protection of Wild Animals Used in Traditional Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neospora caninum is a protozoan associated with abortions in ruminants and neuromuscular disease in dogs. Classically, the immune response against apicomplexan parasites is characterized by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IFN- and TNF. TNF is mainly produced during the acute phases of the infections and binds to TNF receptor 1 (CD120a, p55, TNFR1) activating a variety of cells, hence playing an important role in the induction of the inflammatory process against diverse pathogens. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of TNF in cellular and humoral immune responses during N. caninum infection. For this purpose, we used a mouse model of infection based on wildtype (WT) and genetically deficient C57BL/6 mice in TNFR1 (Tnfr1 (-/-)). We observed that Tnfr1 (-/-) mice presented higher mortality associated with inflammatory lesions and increased parasite burden in the brain after the infection with N. caninum tachyzoites. Moreover, Tnfr1 (-/-) mice showed a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) levels in vivo. We also observed that Tnfr1 (-/-) mice showed enhanced serum concentration of antigen-specific IgG2 subclass, while IgG1 production was significantly reduced compared to WT mice, suggesting that TNFR1 is required for regular IgG subclass production and antigen recognition.

METHODS The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection.

Here, we evaluated and compared the clinical outcomes between the DFT and jejunal interposition (JI) after PG for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of 34 consecutive patients who had undergone PG for upper third gastric cancer between January 2011 and October 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. The main factors investigated were surgical outcomes, postoperative nutritional status, symptoms, and endoscopic findings 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled (DFT, 14; JI, 20). The operation time was similar between the two techniques (228 and 246 minutes for DFT and JI, respectively, P = 0.377), as were the rates of anastomotic complications (7% and 0% for DFT and JI, respectively, P = 0.412). Body weight loss was significantly lower in the DFT group than in the JI group (-8.1% vs -16.1%, P = 0.001). Total protein and albumin levels were higher in the DFT group than in the JI group (0% vs -2.9%, P = 0.053, and -0.3% vs -6.1%, P = 0.077, respectively).

Here we use a mathematical model to analyze the expected effectiveness of symptom monitoring, testing, and quarantine under different estimates of the infectious period, test-positivity relative to time of infection, and test sensitivity to reduce the risk of transmission from infected travelers during and after travel. If infection occurs 0-7 days prior to travel, immediate isolation following symptom onset prior to or during travel reduces risk of transmission while traveling by 26-30%. Pre-departure testing can further reduce risk if testing is close to the time of departure. For example, testing on the day of departure can reduce risk while traveling by 37-61%. For transmission risk after travel with infection time up to 7 days prior to arrival at the destination, isolation based on symptom monitoring reduced introduction risk at the destination by 42-56%. A 14-day quarantine after arrival, without symptom monitoring or testing, can reduce risk by 97-100% on its own. However, a shorter quarantine of 7 days combined with symptom monitoring and a test on day 3-4 after arrival is also effective (95-99%) at reducing introduction risk and is less burdensome, which may improve adherence. To reduce the risk of introduction without quarantine, optimal test timing after arrival is close to the time of arrival; with effective quarantine after arrival, testing a few days later optimizes sensitivity to detect those infected immediately before or while traveling. These measures can complement recommendations such as social distancing, using masks, and hand hygiene, to further reduce risk during and after travel.","output":"Reducing travel-related SARS-CoV-2 transmission with layered mitigation measures: Symptom monitoring, quarantine, and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article identifies the fundamental problems of innovation as a factor in strengthening the economic security of an enterprise in the context of globalization and integration of the worlds economic space.

This review aimed to highlight the main findings on significant associations between neuroimaging and NPSs, the pathophysiology to elucidate possible underlying mechanisms, and methodological issues to aid future research. Research papers published from January 1990 to October 2015 were identified in the databases PsycInfo, Embase, PubMed and Medline, using key words related to NPSs and imaging techniques. In addition to a semi-systematic search in the databases, we also performed hand searches based on reported citations identified to be of interest. Delusions, apathy and depression symptoms were particularly associated with brain changes in AD. The majority of studies disclosed an association between frontal lobe structural and/or metabolic changes and NPSs, implicating, interestingly, for all 12 NPSs studied, the anterior cingulate cortex although temporal, subcortical and parietal regions, and insula were also involved. Given the high degree of connectivity of these brain areas, frontal change correlates of NPSs may help in the understanding of neural network participation. This review also highlights crucial methodological issues that may reduce the heterogeneity of results to enable progress on the pathophysiological mechanisms and aid research on NPS treatments in AD. Based on a broad review of the current literature, a global brain pattern to support the huge heterogeneity of neuroimaging correlates of NPSs in AD and methodological strategies are suggested to help direct future research.","output":"Neuroimaging correlates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease: a review of 20 years of research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is one of the most important topics these days, specifically on search engines and news While fake news is easily shared, scientific papers are reliable sources where information can be extracted With about 24,000 scientific publications on COVID-19 and related research on PubMed, automatic computer-assisted analysis is required In this paper, we develop two methodologies to get insights on specific sub-topics of interest and latest research sub-topics These rely on natural language processing and graph-based visualizations We run these methodologies on two cases: the virus origin and the uses of existing drugs","output":"Getting Insights from a Large Corpus of Scientific Papers on Specialisted Comprehensive Topics - the Case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all the aspects of society since it's onset in early 2020 In addition to infecting and taking the lives of millions of global citizens, the pandemic has fundamentally changed family and work patterns The pandemic and associated mitigation measures have increased the unemployment rates, amplified health risks for essential workers required to work on-site, and led to unprecedented rates of telecommuting Additionally, due to school/daycare closures and social distancing, many parents have lost access to institutional and informal childcare support during the COVID-19 crisis Such losses in childcare support have significantly impacted the paid and unpaid labor of parents, particularly of mothers In this article, we synthesize recent research on pandemic-related changes to work and family in the United States Applying an intersectionality lens, we discuss the gendered implications of these changes Because gender inequality in family and work are connected, COVID-19 has, in many cases, deepened the pre-existing gender inequalities in both realms","output":"The gendered pandemic: The implications of COVID-19 for work and family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND People living with advanced cancer experience significant distress and reduced quality of life due to their symptom burden and life-limiting prognosis. Limited qualitative research has investigated their experiences accessing psychosocial supportive care, and how it meets their needs. AIM To explore patients' perspectives of the role of psychosocial support in their experiences of living with advanced cancer. METHODS This study used an exploratory qualitative research design and drew upon a social constructionist interpretive framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants. Participants were asked about their experiences accessing and using psychosocial support following their diagnosis. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS The following six themes can be used to describe participants' experiences with psychosocial support: 1) accessing different types of support , 2) appreciating support, 3) need, 4) difficulties accessing support, 5) knowing about support, and 6) asking for support. Sources of psychosocial support included family and friends, health professionals, and psychosocial supportive care services. Not all participants were able to access care that met their needs; barriers included suitability of available support, accessibility, and stigma surrounding support use. CONCLUSION Participants experienced broad variation in their awareness and access to psychosocial support services to meet their needs. Providers of psychosocial supportive care for advanced cancer patients need to consider service accessibility issues. Future psychosocial interventions targeting people living with advanced cancer should consider these issues during development and implementation. This article is protected by copyright.

In Poland, obligatory wearing of masks in public spaces was introduced on April 10th, 2020; a relaxation of previous universal measures was announced on May 29th, 2020, limiting use to indoor public places. OBJECTIVE: To assess use of masks or other protective devices in public spaces in Poland during the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic. METHODS: A non-participatory covert observational study was conducted on three dates, (10.05/18.05/25.05.2020) at public spaces in 13 regions with different risks. Ten consecutive individuals were observed by each of 82 medical students (n = 2460 observations), using a structured checklist. RESULTS: Among 2353 observed persons, the female/male ratios were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.0 on the three dates. Almost three quarters - 73.6% (n = 552/750) were using masks on date 1, 66.5% (544/818) on date 2; and 65.7% (516/785) on date 3. Cloth masks predominated on all dates (64.7-62.3%-62.6%), followed by medical (23.4-28.5%-26.9%). Being female (OR = 1.77-1.47-1.53 respectively) and location in a closed space (OR = 2.60-2.59-2.32) were each associated with higher usage. Participants in sports were about two times less likely to use masks (OR = 0.64-0.53-0.53) as compared to other activities. The proportion using masks correctly decreased gradually over time (364/552; 65.9%; 339/544; 62.3% and 304/516; 58.9%). More females wore masks correctly (date 1: 205/294; 69.7% vs 159/258; 61.6%, and date 3: 186/284; 65.5% vs 118/232; 50.9%; p = 0.045; p = 0.0008 respectively). Uncovered noses (47.3-52.7%) and masks around the neck (39.2-42.6%) were the most frequent incorrect practices. CONCLUSIONS: Practices were not in line with official recommendations, especially among males, and deteriorated over time. Cloth masks were predominantly used in public spaces.

Because there are no specific vaccines or drugs for SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing may be a promising approach. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense RNA genome that encodes non-structural proteins (Nsps), which are essential for viral replication in the host cell. Non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) is a multidomain protein and is the largest protein of the replicase complex. Nsp3 contains an ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADRP) domain, also called the macrodomain, which interferes with the host immune response. In the present study, we used computational regression methods to target the ADRP domain of Nsp3, using FDA-approved drugs. We virtually screened 2,892 FDA-approved drugs, using a combination of molecular docking and scoring functions. Saquinavir and trifluperidol were identified as potential leads and were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) to predict the stability and behavior of the ADRP-drug complexes. Analysis of root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface area and number of hydrogen bonds showed that the ADRP-trifluperidol complex is more stable than the ADRP-saquinavir complex. The screening and the MDS results suggest that trifluperidol is a novel inhibitor of the ADRP domain of Nsp3. Trifluperidol could, therefore, potentially be used to help control the spread of COVID-19, either alone or in combination with antiviral agents.

Hence, we tried to understand the effect of synergism of these drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 protease using sequential docking studies. As a result, combination of three drugs showed a better binding energy than that of individual drugs. Further, the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to get insights into the stability of the complex, considering the simultaneous interactions between three drugs and the protein.

Five anti-TNF drugs as well as four biological drugs with a different mechanism of action (abatacept, rituximab, and two IL-6 inhibitors) are currently registered for the treatment of RA. In the past two years, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been introduced in the clinical management of RA, namely tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib. They are small molecules of non-biological origin which enter the cell and inhibit signal transduction. Biological or targeted therapy of RA is indicated in the case of failure of conventional treatment and when there is at least moderate or high RA activity. Five anti-TNF drugs are indicated in the treatment of spondyloarthritides. They have been shown to be equally effective except for etanercept which is not effective for a coexisting inflammatory bowel disease. Recently, the IL-17 inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab have been introduced in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis. Their efficacy on the locomotor system is similar to that of anti-TNF, but they are more effective in treating psoriasis. In the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, TNF inhibitors as well as IL-12/23 axis modulators and interleu?kin-17 inhibitors have been introduced.

The transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been proposed to be as a result of contact with camels, but evidence of human-to-human transmission also exists. In order to work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory setting, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that MERS-CoV should be handled at a biosafety level (BSL) 3 (BSL-3) biocontainment level. Many processes and procedures used to characterize MERS-CoV and to evaluate samples from MERS-CoV infected animals are more easily and efficiently completed at BSL-2 or lower containment.

Consensus guidelines continue to recommend oncologic resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. We hypothesize that there is significant variability in compliance with this recommendation. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by oncologic resection with a pCR (ypT0N0). Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to generate risk and reliability-adjusted rates of adjuvant chemotherapy utilization in patients with pCR at each hospital. RESULTS: In total, 2421 pCR patients were identified. Five-year overall survival was improved in pCR patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not (92 vs. 85%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that improvement in overall survival remained associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44C0.82, p < 0.01). The mean adjuvant chemotherapy utilization rate among hospitals was 32%. There was an upward trend in use over the past decade, but two-thirds still do not receive the recommended therapy. High chemotherapy utilizer hospitals were more likely to be academic centers (54.9 vs. 45.9%, p < 0.01) when compared with low chemotherapy utilizers. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved survival in rectal cancer patients with pCR following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and oncologic resection.

Ther. 1: 77-88, 1996) was successfully carried out for synergism quantification/simulation (CI<1) using only 36 patients with three-doses each and 10 dose data points. Similar studies in this lab (Synergy 3:15-30, 2016) showed two anti-cancer agents against colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenograft tumors in nude mice, synergy quantification using only 70 mice. Furthermore, anti-HIV drug in vitro for 2 to 5-drug combinations, synergism determination using MAL-PD/CI, have appeared in Chou TC, Pharmacol. Rev. 58: 621-681, 2006. As of Jan. 2, 2021, this article has 3,813 citations in 1,030 biomedical journals. From MAL/median-effect Eq. plot (MEP) with x= log (Dose) vs y= log [(fa)/(1-fa)], where fa is the fraction affected, linearized all dose-effect curves (DEC) with slope =m, and x-intercept = anti-log Dm. Therefore, any two-dose date points on MEP, allow the generation of entire DEC by simulation, where the 3rd point is dose-zero, and the 4th point is the universal Dm point. This is the Minimum Two-Data Point Theory (MTDPT), is the basis for Econo-Green Biomedical R&D and Regulatory Guidance, especially for in vivo studies. Thus, 2 becomes 4, 3 becomes 5, and 4 becomes 6 dose-data points, using small number of dose-data points in clinical protocol design which save time, efforts, resources, and reduced the number of patients for computerized diagnostic plots. To unify the Design and Analysis, now, the same MAL-PD/CI is designed for clinical trial protocol against Covid-19, using Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Dexamethasone, in single drug, two and tree drug combinations (A, B, C, A+B, B+C, A+C and A+B+C, 7 sets). These are with the shared constant combo dose-ratios for 2- and 3-drug combos, and the three doses of each of 7 sets, at the dose range of about 1.5-ED50, 1-ED50 and 0.75-ED50, each with >5 patients, using CompuSyn for instant synergy simulations. The benefit for the MAL-PD/CI is that all single drug and their combinations efficacy/synergy in vitro and in vivo (Covid genetic, antigen or neutralization assays or surrogate markers) are compared/ranked under the same MAL-PD principle and the same protocol design-conditions for the unified ranking assessments. The evaluations of other candidate compounds/agents can be designed and analyzed in the same way, just by adjusting the dose-ranges and the combination-ratios.","output":"Pharmacodynamics algorithm integrated assessments-and-ranking of multiple candidate drugs in preclinical and clinical protocol design and quantitative computerized simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of burnout according to job category after the first wave of COVID\\\\19 in Japan and to explore its association with certain factors.

If undiagnosed and/or untreated, postpartum depression can have negative effects on maternal and child health, however, there are few studies on the prevalence of postpartum depression in low- and middle-income countries. To contribute to filling this gap, this study examined the prevalence and risk factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms among women after delivery in Vientiane Capital, Lao PDR. The study was a cross-sectional design, with multistage sampling used to identify women between 4 and 24 weeks after giving birth (N = 521). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to identify women with postpartum depressive symptoms. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions identified risk factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms. The prevalence of postpartum depressive symptoms among participants was 21.3%. Associated factors were having at least 2C3 living children (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1C3.0), experiencing mental health problems during pregnancy (AOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.4C7.6), experiencing conflicts with family members (AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5C4.0), the experience of intimate partner violence (AOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3C5.5), and receiving moderate social support (AOR: 5.6, 95% CI: 3.2C10.0). In contexts where access to mental health specialists has severely constrained maternal and child healthcare providers at primary health care must be supported to develop the necessary skills to identify risk factors and symptoms and offer basic essential services for postpartum depressive symptom (PDS). The study identified a high proportion of mothers with postnatal depressive symptoms, highlighting the need to screen and treat mothers who present with PDS, as not doing so exposes mother and their children to a range of negative health and social outcomes.

Within the United States, tens of millions of workers lost their jobs and financial security during the first few weeks of the national response, in an attempt to slow the global pandemic. Because of the enormity of the pandemic and its potential impact on mental health, the objective of the present study was to document the prevalence of mental health problems and their association with pandemic-related job loss during the third week of the nationwide shutdown. Methods: Mental health was assessed via online questionnaires among a representative sample of 1,013 U.S. adults on April 9C10, 2020. Rates of clinically significant mental health outcomes were compared between participants who lost their job as a result of COVID-19 restrictions (17.4%) vs. those who did not (82.6%). Bivariate multiple logistic regression identified factors that were predictive of, and protective against, mental health problems. Results: The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms was significantly higher than prior population estimates, ranging from 27 to 32% for depression, 30 to 46% for anxiety disorders, 15 to 18% for acute/post-traumatic stress, 25% for insomnia, and 18% for suicidal ideation. Prevalence estimates were 1.5C1.7 times higher for those who reported job loss due to COVID-19 restrictions than those who did not. Mental health problems were predicted by worry over financial instability, insomnia, social isolation, and alcohol consumption, while getting outside more often, perceived social support, and older age were protective against these problems. Conclusions: During the first 3 weeks of lockdowns/stay-at-home restrictions, mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress reactions were notably elevated relative to prior population estimates. Job loss related to the nationwide shutdown was particularly associated with poorer mental health.

The extent to which HCWs may differ in their experience of depression and anxiety is unclear, and longitudinal studies are lacking. The present study examined theorized differences in distress between resilient and non-resilient HCWs over time, as reported in a national online survey. We also examined possible differences in distress as a function of sex and doctoral-level status. METHODS: A national sample responded to an online survey data that included the study measures. Of the HCWs who responded, 666 had useable data at the two time points. A longitudinal structural equation model tested an a priori model that specified the relationship of a resilient personality prototype to self-reported resilience, coping, depression and anxiety at both measurement occasions. Additional invariance models examined possible differences by sex and doctoral-level status. RESULTS: The final model explained 46.4% of the variance in psychological distress at Time 1 and 69.1% at Time 2. A non-resilient personality prototype predicted greater depression and anxiety. A resilient personality prototype was predictive of and operated through self-reported resilience and less disengaged coping to effect lower distress. No effects were found for active coping, however. The final model was generally invariant by sex and HCWs status. Additional analyses revealed that non-doctoral level HCWs had significantly higher depression and anxiety than doctoral-level HCWs on both occasions. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs differ in their susceptibility to distress imposed by COVID-19. Those who are particularly vulnerable may have characteristics that contribute to a lower sense of confidence and efficacy in stressful situations, and more likely to rely on ineffective, disengaged coping behaviors that can exacerbate stress levels.

Worldwide circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans raises the theoretical risk of reverse zoonosis events with wildlife, reintroductions of SARS-CoV-2 into permissive non-domesticated animals, potentially seeding new host reservoir species and geographic regions in which bat SARS-like coronaviruses have not historically been endemic. Here we report that North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and some closely related members of the Cricetidae family of rodents possess key amino acid residues within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to confer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding. Peromyscus rodent species are widely distributed across North America and are the primary host reservoirs of several emerging pathogens that repeatedly spill over into humans including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, deer tick virus, and Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We demonstrate that adult deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection following intranasal exposure to a human isolate, resulting in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract with little or no signs of disease. Further, shed infectious virus is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to na?ve deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and/or the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.

The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually involves in vitro screening that includes standard cytotoxicity controls. Under-appreciated is that viable, but stressed or otherwise compromised cells, can also have a reduced capacity to replicate virus. A refinement proposed herein for in vitro drug screening thus includes a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that cause cellular stress or \\"cytomorbidity\\", as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability. METHODS: A simple rapid bioassay is presented for antiviral drug screening using Vero E6 cells and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. We use high cell density for cytotoxicity assays, and low cell density for cytomorbidity assays. RESULTS: The assay clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. In contrast, nitazoxanide, oleuropein, cyclosporine A and ribavirin all showed no ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 CPE. Hydroxychloroquine, cyclohexamide, didemnin B, ?3-mangostin and linoleic acid were all able to inhibit viral CPE at concentrations that did not induce cytotoxicity. However, these drugs inhibited CPE at concentrations that induced cytomorbidity, indicating non-specific anti-viral activity. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the methodology for a simple in vitro drug screening assay that identifies potential anti-viral drugs via their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE. The additional growth assay illustrated how several drugs display anti-viral activity at concentrations that induce cytomorbidity. For instance, hydroxychloroquine showed anti-viral activity at concentrations that slow cell growth, arguing that its purported in vitro anti-viral activity arises from non-specific impairment of cellular activities. The cytomorbidity assay can therefore rapidly exclude potential false positives.","output":"Simple rapid in vitro screening method for SARS-CoV-2 anti-virals that identifies potential cytomorbidity-associated false positives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether hearing difficulties exacerbate the damaging effects of enforced social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic on isolation and loneliness, and lead to accelerated mental health issues and cognitive dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the 12-week outcomes of the digitally delivered Gro Health intervention, a holistic digital behavior change app designed for self-management of mental well-being, sleep, activity, and nutrition. METHODS: The study used a quasi-experimental research design consisting of an open-label, single-arm, pre-post intervention engagement using a convenience sample. Adults who had joined the Gro Health app (intervention) and had a complete baseline dataset (ie, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) were followed up at 12 weeks (n=273), including 33 (12.1%) app users who reported a positive COVID-19 diagnosis during the study period. User engagement with the Gro Health platform was tracked by measuring total minutes of app engagement. Paired t tests were used to compare pre-post intervention scores. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between minutes of active engagement with the Gro Health app and changes in scores across the different mental health measures. RESULTS: Of the 347 study participants, 273 (78.67%) completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Changes in scores for anxiety, perceived stress, and depression were predicted by app engagement, with the strongest effect observed for changes in perceived stress score (F(1,271)=251.397; R(2)=0.479; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: A digital behavior change platform that provides remote mental well-being support can be effective in managing depression, anxiety, and perceived stress during times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The present discourse aim is first to scrutinize and assess the available literature on COVID\\\\19 repercussion on the central nervous system (CNS). Standard literature and database searches were implemented, gathered relevant material, and extracted information was then assessed. RESULTS: The angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors being the receptor for the virus, the threat to the central nervous system is expected. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2 receptors in the CNS, and recent studies suggest that activated glial cells contribute to neuroinflammation and the devastating effects of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection on the CNS. The SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\induced immune\\\\mediated demyelinating disease, cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and depression are some of the neurological complications discussed here. CONCLUSION: This review correlates present clinical manifestations of COVID\\\\19 patients with possible neurological consequences in the future, thus preparing healthcare providers for possible future consequences of COVID\\\\19.","output":"Does COVID\\\\19 contribute to development of neurological disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of implementing e-learning depends on students' perceptions regarding this learning, the ability to use IT, to the online learning process carried out in mathematics courses.

In total, 78 patients with TMD-associated pain responded and 113 patients with pain in other orofacial regions responded. Results Patients with chronic TMD pain reported a higher self-rated stress level, which correlated with significantly increased pain intensity, and analgesic consumption. In contrast, patients experiencing non-TMD pain did not report of any increase pain, regardless of their stress levels.

This information is necessary for government and philanthropic agencies to tailor mental health supports, services, and resources for veterans in the peri- and post-pandemic periods. The objective of this study was to compare mental health symptoms between Canadian Armed Forces (CAFs) veterans and the general Canadian older adult population in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of older adults in the national Canadian COVID-19 Coping Study. Individuals aged 55 years and older were eligible. A convenience sample of older adults was recruited through a web-based survey administered between May 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Canadian Armed Force military service history status (yes/no) was ascertained. The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item Loneliness Scale were used to measure mental health symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression compared the odds of screening positive for depression, anxiety, and loneliness between veterans and non-veterans. RESULTS: Of 1,541 respondents who answered the final question (87% survey completeness rate), 210 were veterans. Forty percent of veterans met criteria for at least one of the mental health diagnoses compared to 46% of non-veterans (P = .12). The odds of reporting elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were similar for veteran and non-veteran respondents after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: Veterans' report of mental health symptoms was similar to the general population Spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although veterans' military training may better prepare them to adapt in the face of a pandemic, additional research is needed to understand the longitudinal impacts on physical and mental health.","output":"COVID-19 and the Mental Health of Canadian Armed Forces Veterans: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses relevant aspects in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

While it is being recommended to carry out only the emergent procedures and to postpone the non-urgent ones to a later date, this article is meant to provide an insight into triage of the ENT procedures and the various precautions to be taken into account by the ENT surgeons while carrying out a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery. RESULTS: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater. CONCLUSION: A proper knowledge of triage would be of immense help to the ENT surgeon in minimizing the exposure to health care workers and patients during this pandemic.

Further, no previous work has explored the role played by SM tools in knowledge translation. The objectives of this work are 1. To evaluate the students perceptions on the accessibility and acceptability of SM tools via an anonymous online survey and 2. Assess the efficacy of SM tools as an educational medium in imparting knowledge change. An online survey using an anonymous web-based questionnaire was conducted to assess the students accessibility and acceptability of SM tools as a direct information sharing pathway between the faculty and students. A randomized comparative design was utilized to evaluate knowledge change via an online examination administered 10 min before and after an online class delivered via 2 different SM platforms (Google meet, YouTube) and e-mail. Results Data were obtained from 627 participants through a survey. Though 71.1% of the respondents believed online classes have helped them in their study, only 21.4% and 22.6% of the participants strongly agreed that social networking platforms are helpful for teaching and will be used for teaching/learning in the future respectively.

Methods: In this multicenter and prospective study, a total of 1,050 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were consecutively screened. Finally, 402 laboratory-confirmed critically ill patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. A triple cut-point strategy of NT-proBNP was applied to assess the probability of HF.

Prognostic risk factors were analyzed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression, further formulating a nomogram to predict mortality. Results: Within a 30-day follow-up, 27.4% of the 402 patients died.

Recent evidence indicates that even though most pregnant have a mild or asymptomatic course, a severe course of COVID-19 and a higher risk of progression to diseases have also been described, along with a heightened risk for pregnancy complications. Yet, vertical transmission of the virus is rare and the possibility of placental SARS-CoV-2 infection as a prerequisite for vertical transmission requires further studies. We here assessed the severity of COVID-19 and onset of neonatal infections in an observational study of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Our placental analyses showed a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 viral expression ex vivo in term placentae under acute infection. No viral placental expression was detectable in convalescent pregnant women. Inoculation of placental explants generated from placentas of non-infected women at birth with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro revealed inefficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in different types of placental tissues, which provides a rationale for the low ex vivo viral expression. We further detected specific SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in pregnant women within a few days upon infection, which was undetectable in cord blood. Our present findings confirm that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare, likely due to the inefficient virus replication in placental tissues. Despite the predominantly benign course of infection in most mothers and negligible risk of vertical transmission, continuous vigilance on the consequences of COVID-19 during pregnancy is required, since the maternal immune activation in response to the SARS-CoV2 infection may have long-term consequences for children's health.","output":"Inefficient Placental Virus Replication and Absence of Neonatal Cell-Specific Immunity Upon Sars-CoV-2 Infection During Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and its management in patients with epilepsy can be complex.

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera.

Despite low amino acid sequence identity, all PA clan proteases share a conserved double -barrel structure. Using an automated structure-based hierarchical clustering method, we identified a common structural core of 72 amino acid residues for 143 PA clan proteases that represent 12 protein families and 11 subfamilies. The identified core is located around the catalytic site between the two -barrels and resembles the structures of the smallest PA clan proteases. We constructed a structure-based distance tree derived from the properties of the identified common core. Our structure-based analyses support the current classification of these proteases at the subfamily level and largely at the family level. Structural alignment and structure-based distance trees could thus be used for directing objective classification of PA clan proteases and to strengthen their higher order classification.

METHODS: To retrieve the vitamin D levels data, the authors analyzed the vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) statement on vitamin D status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to be used for analysis, only recently published data that included general adult population of both genders aged 40-65 years or wider and must have included the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: There were data sets from 10 countries that fitted the criteria and were analyzed. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25a?nmol/L (10a?ng/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million of population from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency showed a strong correlation with ra?= 0.79, pa?= 0.007. Over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptotically increased. After adjusting for countries' age structure and per capita health expenditures, multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality. Each 1% increase in prevalence increased deaths by 55 per million (95% confidence interval, CI 8-102), pa?= 0.03. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend universal screening for vitamin D deficiency, and further investigation of Vitamin D supplementation in randomized control studies, which may lead to possible treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","output":"Strong correlation between prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency and population mortality rate from COVID-19 in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resuscitation with IV fluids is a critical component in the management of sepsis. Although the optimal volume of IV fluid is unknown, there is evidence that excessive administration can be deleterious. Static measures of volume status have not proven to be meaningful resuscitative endpoints. Determination of volume responsiveness has putative benefits over static measures, but its effect on outcomes is unknown. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if resuscitation with a volume responsiveness-guided approach leads to improved outcomes in septic patients. Data Sources We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception until April 2018. Study Selection Prospective studies of patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock that compared volume responsiveness-guided fluid resuscitation to standard techniques and reported mortality data. Data Extraction We extracted study details, patient characteristics, volume responsiveness assessment method, and mortality data. Data Synthesis Of the 1,224 abstracts and 31 full-texts evaluated, four studies (total 365 patients) met inclusion criteria. Using random effects modeling, the pooled odds ratio for mortality at time of longest follow-up with a volume responsiveness-guided strategy was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.49-1.54). Pooling of clinical data was not possibly owing to heterogeneity of reporting in individual studies. Conclusions We found no significant difference in mortality between septic patients resuscitated with a volume responsiveness-guided approach compared with standard resuscitative strategies.

This is compounded by a lack of community and policy maker awareness or understanding of its burden, causes and solutions. Research addressing these knowledge gaps is urgently needed. However, capacity for adolescent mental health research in Tanzania remains limited. The existence of a National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), with a nationwide mandate for research conduct and oversight, presents an opportunity to catalyse activity in this neglected area. Rigorous research priority setting, which includes key stakeholders, can promote efficient use of limited resources and improve both quality and uptake of research by ensuring that it meets the needs of target populations and policy makers. We present a protocol for such a research priority setting study and how it informs the design of an interinstitutional adolescent mental health research capacity strengthening strategy in Tanzania. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: From May 2021, this 6 month mixed-methods study will adapt and merge the James Lind Alliance approach and validated capacity strengthening methodologies to identify priorities for research and research capacity strengthening in adolescent mental health in Tanzania. Specifically, it will use online questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, focus groups, scoping reviews and a consensus meeting to consult expert and adolescent stakeholders. Key evidence-informed priorities will be collaboratively ranked and documented and an integrated strategy to address capacity gaps will be designed to align with the nationwide infrastructure and overall strategy of NIMR. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: National and institutional review board approvals were sought and granted from the National Health Research Ethics Committee of the NIMR Medical Research Coordinating Committee (Tanzania) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (United Kingdom). Results will be disseminated through a national workshop involving all stakeholders, through ongoing collaborations and published commentaries, reviews, policy briefs, webinars and social media.","output":"Adolescent mental health research in Tanzania: a study protocol for a priority setting exercise and the development of an interinstitutional capacity strengthening programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pooling of samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing in low-prevalence settings has been used as an effective strategy to expand testing capacity and mitigate challenges with the shortage of supplies. We evaluated two automated molecular test systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pooled specimens. METHODS: Pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were tested by Qiagen QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat) or Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert), and the results were compared to that of standard RT-qPCR tests without pooling. RESULTS: In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n = 105) and 74.1%/100% (n = 260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n = 250) and 100%/99.5% (n = 200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool; n = 150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT ) from standard testing. RT-qPCR CT values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat and Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.85 to 0.99, p < 0.05). However, the CT values from Xpert were significantly stronger (p < 0.01, paired t test) than that of QIAstat in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, with mean differences of -4.3  2.43 and -4.6  2 for individual and pooled tests, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Xpert SARS-CoV-2 can be utilized for pooled sample testing for COVID-19 screening in low-prevalence settings providing significant cost savings and improving throughput without affecting test quality.","output":"Evaluation of automated molecular tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pooled nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the past decade, the identification and characterization of antiviral genes with the ability to interfere with virus replication has established cell-intrinsic innate immunity as a third line of antiviral defense in addition to adaptive and classical innate immunity. Understanding how cellular factors have evolved to inhibit HIV-1 reveals particularly vulnerable points of the viral replication cycle. Many, but not all, antiviral proteins share type I interferon-upregulated expression and sensitivity to viral counteraction or evasion measures. Whereas well-established restriction factors interfere with early post-entry steps and release of HIV-1, recent research has revealed a diverse set of proteins that reduce the infectious quality of released particles using individual, to date poorly understood modes of action. These include induction of paucity of mature glycoproteins in nascent virions or self-incorporation into the virus particle, resulting in poor infectiousness of the virion and impaired spread of the infection.

JAKs are important signaling mediators of many proinflammatory cytokines and represent compelling pharmacological targets for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pan-acting small-molecule JAK inhibitors were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. However, their limited selectivity among JAK members have led to undesirable side effects, driving a search toward specific JAK inhibitors. Recently, TYK2 has emerged as a target of choice for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19 with an optimum balance between efficacy and safety, based on observations from human genetics studies and clinical outcomes of several agents targeting cytokine pathways for which TYK2 plays an essential role. In this article, we address selective targeting of TYK2 from the genetic sequence space through development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against TYK2 mRNA. Potent ASO candidates were identified from the screening of over 200 ASOs using locked nucleic acid gapmer design. The lead ASOs exhibited potent and selective knockdown of TYK2 mRNA and protein across a panel of model human cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, showing no reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of other JAK paralogs. In agreement with the depletion of TYK2 proteins, several TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling pathways, including IFN- and IL-12, were inhibited upon ASO treatment.

Protection measures to prevention the disease impacted education and undergraduate students were exposed to additional stressors. OBJECTIVES: Analyze depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in undergraduates, their respective predictors and the association with satisfaction with life, psychological well-being and coping strategies. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted from September 14 to October 19, 2020, involving undergraduate students enrolled in 33 courses from 5 public university campuses in the state of Parana, Brazil, using: questionnaire with sociodemographic, academic, health and pandemic effects variables; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS); Psychological Well-Being (PWB); BriefCOPE. The convenience sample was composed of 1,224 participants, with 18 years old or older, that completed all research instruments. Spearman correlation and logistic analysis (univariate and multivariate) were applied to the collected data. RESULTS: Most of the undergraduates presented symptoms of depression (60.5%), anxiety (52.5%) and stress (57.5%). Depression, anxiety and stress presented significant correlations in common: negative with satisfaction with life, all dimensions of psychological well-being, and 3 adaptive copings (active coping, planning, positive reframing); positive with 5 maladaptive copings (behavioral disengagement, denial, self-blame, self-distraction, substance use). In addition, there were 7 common predictors for symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress: female; age 18C24 years old; having a chronic disease; lower scores in 2 dimensions of psychological well-being (positive relations with others, self-acceptance); higher scores in 2 maladaptive copings (self-blame, substance use).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome contains a unique N-terminal fragment in the Spike protein, which allows it to bind to air pollutants in the environment. Our approach in this review is to study ozone and its effect on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Article data were collected from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Ozone therapy has antiviral properties, improves blood flow, facilitates the transfer of oxygen in hypoxemic tissues, and reduces blood coagulation phenomena in COVID-19 patients. Ozone has immunomodulatory effects by modulating cytokines (reduction of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-, and interleukin-10), induction of interferon-, anti-inflammatory properties by modulating NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3, inhibition of cytokine storm (blocking nuclear factor-B and stimulating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway), stimulates cellular/humoral immunity/phagocytic function and blocks angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In direct oxygen-ozone injection, oxygen reacts with several biological molecules such as thiol groups in albumin to form ozonoids. Intravenous injection of ozonated saline significantly increases the length of time a person can remain hypoxic. The rectal ozone protocol is rectal ozone insufflation, resulting in clinical improvement in oxygen saturation and biochemical improvement (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein). In general, many studies have shown the positive effect of ozone therapy as a complementary therapy in the recovery of COVID-19 patients.

We find that states in the South tended to fall behind the rest of the country in the 1970s and 1980s, while states in the Great Plains and Mountain West tended to fall behind in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In contrast, states on the East and West Coasts have tended to see considerable improvement in mortality. We consider the role of state-level per-capita spending on public welfare programs in the mortality experience of states between 1977 and 2017.

METHODS: The study proposed the ARIMA, SARIMA and Prophet models to predict daily new cases and cumulative confirmed cases in the USA, Brazil and India over the next 30 days based on the COVID-19 new confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases data set(May 1, 2020, and November 30, 2021) published by the official WHO, Three models were implemented in the R 4.1.1 software with forecast and prophet package. The performance of different models was evaluated by using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). RESULTS: Through the fitting and prediction of daily new case data, we reveal that the Prophet model has more advantages in the prediction of the COVID-19 of the USA, which could compose data components and capture periodic characteristics when the data changes significantly, while SARIMA is more likely to appear over-fitting in the USA. And the SARIMA model captured a seven-day period hidden in daily COVID-19 new cases from 3 countries. While in the prediction of new cumulative cases, the ARIMA model has a better ability to fit and predict the data with a positive growth trend in different countries(Brazil and India). CONCLUSIONS: This study can shed light on understanding the outbreak trends and give an insight into the epidemiological control of these regions. Further, the prediction of the Prophet model showed sufficient accuracy in the daily COVID-19 new cases of the USA. The ARIMA model is suitable for predicting Brazil and India, which can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.

On the other hand, to better assist those individuals with essential health care services in the event of an emergency, their regular activities should be monitored. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors may be employed to track the sequence of activities of individuals via ambient sensors, providing real-time insights on daily activity patterns and easy access to the data through the connected ecosystem. Previous surveys to identify the regular activity patterns of older adults were deficient in the limited number of participants, short period of activity tracking, and high reliance on predefined normal activity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to overcome the aforementioned challenges by performing a pilot study to evaluate the utilization of large-scale data from smart home thermostats that collect the motion status of individuals for every 5-minute interval over a long period of time. METHODS: From a large-scale dataset, we selected a group of 30 households who met the inclusion criteria (having at least 8 sensors, being connected to the system for at least 355 days in 2018, and having up to 4 occupants). The indoor activity patterns were captured through motion sensors. We used the unsupervised, time-based, deep neural-network architecture long short-term memory-variational autoencoder to identify the regular activity pattern for each household on 2 time scales: annual and weekday. The results were validated using 2019 records. The area under the curve as well as loss in 2018 were compatible with the 2019 schedule. Daily abnormal behaviors were identified based on deviation from the regular activity model. RESULTS: The utilization of this approach not only enabled us to identify the regular activity pattern for each household but also provided other insights by assessing sleep behavior using the sleep time and wake-up time. We could also compare the average time individuals spent at home for the different days of the week. From our study sample, there was a significant difference in the time individuals spent indoors during the weekend versus on weekdays. CONCLUSIONS: This approach could enhance individual health monitoring as well as public health surveillance. It provides a potentially nonobtrusive tool to assist public health officials and governments in policy development and emergency personnel in the event of an emergency by measuring indoor behavior while preserving privacy and using existing commercially available thermostat equipment.","output":"Understanding User Behavior Through the Use of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Proof of Concept Using Internet of Things Smart Home Thermostat Data for Improving Public Health Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronavirus cases are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into quarantine.

We aimed to use interpretable artificial intelligence technology to create a preoperative predictor for postoperative intensive care unit need in emergency surgery patients. METHODS A novel, interpretable artificial intelligence technology called optimal classification trees was leveraged in an 80:20 train:test split of adult emergency surgery patients in the 2007-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory values were used to develop, train, and then validate optimal classification tree algorithms to predict the need for postoperative intensive care unit admission. The latter was defined as postoperative death or the development of 1 or more postoperative complications warranting critical care (eg, unplanned intubation, ventilator requirement 48 hours, cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and septic shock). An interactive and user-friendly application was created. C statistics were used to measure performance. RESULTS A total of 464,861 patients were included. The mean age was 55 years, 48% were male, and 11% developed severe postoperative complications warranting critical care. The Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application was created as the user-friendly interface of the complex optimal classification tree algorithms. The number of questions (ie, tree depths) needed to predict intensive care unit admission ranged from 2 to 11. The Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application had excellent discrimination for predicting the need for intensive care unit admission (C statistics: 0.89 train, 0.88 test). CONCLUSION We recommend the Predictive OpTimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk Intensive Care Unit application as an accurate, artificial intelligence-based tool for predicting severe complications warranting intensive care unit admission after emergency surgery.

Previous studies have found no relationship between month of the year and surgical volume. However, seasonal events and greater use of high-deductible health insurance plans may cause U.S. patients to schedule elective surgery later in the calendar year. The hypothesis was that elective anesthesia caseloads would be higher in December than in other months. METHODS This review analyzed yearly adult case data in Florida and Texas locations of a multistate anesthesia practice from 2017 to 2019. To focus on elective caseload, the study excluded obstetric, weekend, and holiday cases. Time trend decomposition analysis was used with seasonal variation to assess differences between December and other months in daily caseload and their relationship to age and insurance subgroups. RESULTS A total of 3,504,394 adult cases were included in the analyses. Overall, daily caseloads increased by 2.5  0.1 cases per day across the 3-yr data set. After adjusting for time trends, the average daily December caseload in 2017 was 5,039 cases (95% CI, 4,900 to 5,177), a 20% increase over the January-to-November baseline (4,196 cases; 95% CI, 4,158 to 4,235; P < 0.0001). This increase was replicated in 2018: 5,567 cases in December (95% CI, 5,434 to 5,700) versus 4,589 cases at baseline (95% CI, 4,538 to 4,641), a 21.3% increase; and in 2019: 6,103 cases in December (95% CI, 5,871 to 6,334) versus 5,045 cases at baseline (95% CI, 4,984 to 5,107), a 21% increase (both P < 0.001). The proportion of commercially insured patients and those aged 18 to 64 yr was also higher in December than in other months. CONCLUSIONS In this 3-yr retrospective analysis, it was observed that, after accounting for time trends, elective anesthesia caseloads were higher in December than in other months of the year. Proportions of commercially insured and younger patients were also higher in December. When compared to previous studies finding no increase, this pattern suggests a recent shift in elective surgical scheduling behavior.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease.

The correlation between the change in corneal biomechanical indexes and the change in general ocular measurement parameters was analyzed. A one-way ANOVA test compared general ocular measurement and corneal biomechanical parameters. Pearsons correlation coefficient was analyzed to correlate corneal biomechanical and general ocular measurement parameters. RESULTS: The general ophthalmometric parameters: Spherical equivalent (SE), intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL), differed significantly among subjects in myopia, emmetropia, and hyperopic groups.

We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals.

This implies a worsening of patient's prognosis and an increase in morbidity and mortality. The metabolic pathways and molecular factors involved in the genesis of this injury are still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to carry out an integrative review about the pathophysiology and possible molecular mechanisms of liver injury by COVID-19. METHODS: We carried out an integrative literature review in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase from December 2020 to March 2021 using the following descriptors: # 1 COVID-19 (MeSH) AND / OR # 2 Liver injury (MeSH) AND / OR # 3 Pathophysiology (MesH). RESULTS: The data were extracted and divided into two main themes, for heuristic purposes: Hepatotropism and SARS-CoV-2, and Pathophysiological hypotheses for liver injury associated with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The virus seems to promote liver damage through five mechanisms: direct injury, humoral and cellular inflammatory response, hypoxemia caused by a decrease in the effective circulating volume, reinfection through the portal system, and use of drugs in the treatment. The literature also points out that the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme II and transmembrane serine protease 2 receptors is expressive in cholangiocyte and is present in hepatocytes, which is a risk factor for the virus to enter these cells. Finally, patients with previous liver disease appear to be more susceptible to liver injury by COVID-19.","output":"Pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of liver injury in severe forms of COVID-19: an integrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymyxin B is a last-line antibiotic for extensively resistant Gram-negative bacterial infection. Skin hyperpigmentation is a serious side effect induced by polymyxin B that severely compromises the psychological health and compliance of patients. The literature lacks mechanistic studies that explain how hyperpigmentation occurs, and this substantially hinders the development of intervention strategies and improved compliance. SK-MEL-2 cells were used for the polymyxin B-induced hyperpigmentation mechanism study. Melanin content and tyrosinase activity were measured after polymyxin B treatment. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeling quantitative proteomics was employed to investigate the response of SK-MEL-2 cells to polymyxin B treatment. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were applied to validate the mRNA and protein levels of related genes and proteins. The melanin content and tyrosinase activity were significantly upregulated after polymyxin B treatment in SK-MEL-2 cells at 48 h and 72 h. Quantitative proteomics showed that 237 proteins were upregulated and 153 proteins were downregulated in the 48 h group, and 49 proteins were upregulated and 49 proteins were downregulated in the 72 h group. The differentially expressed proteins were involved in pathways such as lysosome, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and calcium signaling pathway. The upregulation of melanogenic enzymes and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) was validated by qPCR and Western blot. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of PI3K, -catenin, and cyclic-AMP response binding protein (CREB) in response to polymyxin B treatment was observed. The present study reveals the proteomic response of polymyxin B-induced melanogenesis in SK-MEL-2 cells for the first time. Signaling pathways, including melanin biosynthesis, PI3K/Akt, and calcium signaling pathways may be involved in the mechanism of melanogenesis. IMPORTANCE Polymyxin B-induced skin hyperpigmentation seriously affects the psychological health and compliance of patients. This study provides a proteomic clue to the mechanism at the cellular level for understanding polymyxin B-induced hyperpigmentation, contributing to a follow-up investigation of the corresponding PI3K/Akt signaling transduction pathway and calcium signaling pathway. The elucidation of its underlying mechanism is of great significance for patients' compliance improvement, intervention strategy, and new drug development.","output":"Proteomic Response Revealed Signaling Pathways Involving in the Mechanism of Polymyxin B-Induced Melanogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Cryptogenic ischemic strokes constitute 20-30% of ischemic strokes, the majority of which are embolic strokes of undetermined source.

DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in approximately 6000 patients and 550 centers with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Subjects are randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for an expected minimum of six-months and up to approximately three-years. It is an event-driven trial aiming for 353 adjudicated primary outcome events. STUDY OUTCOMES The primary efficacy outcome is time to first recurrent stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unspecified). Key secondary outcomes are time to first ischemic stroke and time to first occurrence in the composite outcome of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome is major hemorrhage, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. RESULTS: Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. DISCUSSION: In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","output":"The ups and downs of daily life during COVID-19: Age differences in affect, stress, and positive events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanostructured MnO2 with various morphologies exhibits excellent performance in environmental catalysis owing to its large specific surface area, low density, and adjustable chemical properties. The one-dimensional MnO2 nanowire has been proved to be the dominant morphology among various nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanofibers, nanoflowers, etc. The syntheses and applications of MnO2-based nanowires also have become a research hotspot in environmental catalytic materials over the last two decades. With the continuous deepening of the research, the control of morphology and crystal facet exposure in the synthesis of MnO2 nanowire materials have gradually matured, and the catalytic performance also has been greatly improved. Differences in the crystalline phase structure, preferably exposed crystal facets, and even the length of the MnO2 nanowires will evidently affect the final catalytic performances. Besides, the modifications by doping or loading will also significantly affect their catalytic performances. This review carefully summarizes the synthesis strategies of MnO2 nanowires developed in recent years as well as the influences of the phase structure, crystal facet, morphology, dopant, and loading amount on the catalytic performance. Besides, the cutting-edge applications of MnO2 nanowires in the field of environmental catalysis, such as CO oxidation, the removal of VOCs, denitrification, etc., have been also summarized. The application of MnO2 nanowire in environmental catalysis is still in the early exploratory stage.

In contrast, current information technology combined with a new generation of near-real time tests offers consumer-engaged smartphone-based lab-in-a-phone internet-of-things (IoT) connected devices that provide increased pandemic monitoring.

The COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems particularly the lungs and heart. Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. In our review of clinical studies, we found that in 26 studies including 11,685 patients, the weighted pooled prevalence of acute myocardial injury was 20% (ranged from 5% to 38% depending on the criteria used). The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and endotheliitis in several organs including heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction. Cardiac biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis as well as risk stratification.

Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA; antiC(2) glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturers threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals.

P2P e\\\\learning platforms need to improve their user interface design and user experience to increase the Perceived ease of use for their users. What is already known about this topic E\\\\learning which poses issues such as isolation, demotivation and learning attrition became the primary means of education due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Issues with e\\\\learning can be counterbalanced by peer\\\\to\\\\peer (P2P) learning. There is a renewed interest in user acceptance of e\\\\learning via different platforms, as the sudden and prolonged shift to e\\\\learning is revealing different results relative to what was known pre\\\\pandemic. What this article adds Usage of the extended TAM model to predict users' acceptance of P2P e\\\\learning platforms during a pandemic. Extending the TAM model with a renewed focus on the importance of self\\\\efficacy and Internet self\\\\efficacy in accepting P2P e\\\\learning during a period of complete remote learning. Extending the TAM model with credibility as a factor: because P2P platforms allow any user to provide answers, students may struggle with choosing which answer to accept. Credibility was discovered to have a positive association with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude towards P2P platforms. A positive association between perceived usefulness and attitude could not be confirmeda discovery we consider related to the supplementary way the P2P platform was utilised. Perceived ease of use had a larger association with the intention to use P2P e\\\\learning than perceived usefulness, thus suggesting that students are more concerned with the ease of finding an answer than the usefulness obtained from it. Implications for practice and/or policy P2P e\\\\learning platforms should consider means through which an answer's credibility can be increased in order to bolster the ATT towards them. At a macro level, schools should consider the self\\\\efficacy and Internet self\\\\efficacy of students to ensure they are able to partake in e\\\\learning and provide training and resources to those who are lacking.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of race, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, on all-cause, in-hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 11 210 adult patients (age 18 years) hospitalized with confirmed severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between February 19, 2020, and May 31, 2020, in 92 hospitals in 12 states: Alabama (6 hospitals), Maryland (1 hospital), Florida (5 hospitals), Illinois (8 hospitals), Indiana (14 hospitals), Kansas (4 hospitals), Michigan (13 hospitals), New York (2 hospitals), Oklahoma (6 hospitals), Tennessee (4 hospitals), Texas (11 hospitals), and Wisconsin (18 hospitals). EXPOSURES: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Death during hospitalization was examined overall and by race. Race was self-reported and categorized as Black, White, and other or missing. Cox proportional hazards regression with mixed effects was used to evaluate associations between all-cause in-hospital mortality and patient characteristics while accounting for the random effects of hospital on the outcome. RESULTS: Of 11 210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting to hospitals, 4180 (37.3%) were Black patients and 5583 (49.8%) were men. The median (interquartile range) age was 61 (46 to 74) years. Compared with White patients, Black patients were younger (median [interquartile range] age, 66 [50 to 80] years vs 61 [46 to 72] years), were more likely to be women (2259 [49.0%] vs 2293 [54.9%]), were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (611 [13.3%] vs 1031 [24.7%]), and had higher median (interquartile range) scores on the Neighborhood Deprivation Index (?0.11 [?0.70 to 0.56] vs 0.82 [0.08 to 1.76]) and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (21 [0 to 44] vs 22 [0 to 46]). All-cause in-hospital mortality among hospitalized White and Black patients was 23.1% (724 of 3218) and 19.2% (540 of 2812), respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, insurance, comorbidities, neighborhood deprivation, and site of care, there was no statistically significant difference in risk of mortality between Black and White patients (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although current reports suggest that Black patients represent a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections and death in the United States, in this study, mortality for those able to access hospital care did not differ between Black and White patients after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.","output":"Association of Race With Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at 92 US Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, almost all residency programs have adopted virtual interviewing for the National Residency Matching Program (R) (NRMP) or The Match (R) 2021.

The aim of this study was to compare the interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the E484K, N501Y and South Africa triple spike variants and ACE2 with the interaction between wild-type spike RBD-ACE2 and to show whether the obtained binding affinities and conformations corraborate clinical findings. The structures of the RBDs of the E484K, N501Y and South Africa triple variants were generated with DS Studio v16 and energetically minimized using the CHARMM22 force field. Protein-protein dockings were performed in the HADDOCK server and the obtained wild-type and mutant spike-ACE2 complexes were submitted to 200-ns molecular dynamics simulations with subsequent free energy calculations using GROMACS. Based on docking binding affinities and free energy calculations the E484K, N501Y and triple mutant variants were found to interact stronger with the ACE2 than the wild-type spike. Interestingly, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA results showed that E484K and spike triple mutant complexes were more stable than the N501Y one. Moreover, the E484K and South Africa triple mutants triggered greater conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein than N501Y. The E484K variant alone, or the combination of K417N + E484K + N501Y mutations induce significant conformational transitions in the spike glycoprotein, while increasing the spike-ACE2 binding affinity.

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of published liver manifestations and described the liver damage in COVID-19 patients with death or survival. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane Library, Embase, and three Chinese electronic databases through April 22, 2020. We analyzed pooled data on liver chemistries stratified by the main clinical outcome of COVID-19 using a fixed or random-effects model. Results: In the meta-analysis of 18 studies, which included a total of 2,862 patients, the pooled mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 30.9 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death and 26.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). The pooled mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 45.3 IU/L in the COVID-19 patients with death while 30.1 IU/L in the patients discharged alive (p < 0.0001). Compared with the discharged alive cases, the dead cases tended to have lower albumin levels but longer prothrombin time, and international standardized ratio.

A pre-coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group was managed with pre-existing guidelines, compared to new guidelines for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group. A telephone survey was performed on out-patients with non-dissolvable packs to assess patient comfort and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were seen. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group had significantly more patients aged over 65 years (p = 0.004), an increased use of absorbable dressings and local haemostatic agents (Nasopore and Surgiflo), and fewer admissions (all p < 0.0005). Rates of re-presentation and morbidity, and length of hospital stay were similar. The telephone survey revealed out-patient management to be efficacious and feasible.

Therefore, the identification of essential proteins in a network can help to explain the structure, function, and dynamics of basic cellular networks. The existing dynamic protein networks regard the protein components as the same at all time points; however, the role of proteins can vary over time. METHODS: To improve the accuracy of identifying essential proteins, an improved h-index algorithm based on the attenuation coefficient method is proposed in this paper. This method incorporates previously neglected node information to improve the accuracy of the essential protein search. Based on choosing the appropriate attenuation coefficient, the values, such as monotonicity, SN, SP, PPV and NPV of different essential protein search algorithms are tested. RESULTS: The experimental results show that, the algorithm proposed in this paper can ensure the accuracy of the found proteins while identifying more essential proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The described experiments show that this method is more effective than other similar methods in identifying essential proteins in dynamic protein networks. This study can better explain the mechanism of life activities and provide theoretical basis for the research and development of targeted drugs.","output":"Identifying essential proteins in dynamic protein networks based on an improved h-index algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a new sutureless connector for end-to-end arterial anastomosis. METHODS The anastomotic device is a connector consisting of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface, which is introduced through the prosthesis. The seal of the anastomosis is obtained by inflating a balloon anchoring the stent with the spikes in the prosthesis and in the receiving artery. This experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) A feasibility study was done on four cadaveric femoral arteries using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis, with measurement of the penetration of the spikes into the layers of the arterial wall. (2) Bench tests were conducted in seven automated and in seven sutured anastomoses. Anastomosis sealing was tested using a pump system (250 mm Hg) in a water-filled closed circuit. (3) The infrarenal aorta of seven pigs was replaced with a 6- to 8-mm diameter prosthesis, using this automated device for the proximal anastomosis. The distal anastomosis was handsewn on the aortic bifurcation. After completion angiography, animals were euthanized for macroscopic and histologic studies of the aorta, connector, and prosthesis. Explantations were done immediately (2 pigs), and at 15 (2 pigs), at 30 (2 pigs), and 42 days (1 pig). Study end points were the automated anastomosis time compared with manual suturing, leakage, mechanical strength, and patency of the anastomosis together with the histologic changes of the aortic wall in contact with the spiked stent. RESULTS Tests performed on four cadaveric arteries showed complete penetration of the spikes into the arterial wall layers without metal fracture. Tests of traction showed that the median force needed to rupture the automated anastomosis was 18.3 N (interquartile range [IQR], 17.7-19.9 N), with no significant difference from the handmade anastomosis (19.5 N; IQR, 17.9-20.2 N, P = .33). No leakage was demonstrated in vitro with a pulsatile flow and a pressure up to 250 mm Hg. The median automated anastomosis time on pig aorta was 2.4 minutes (IQR, 1.4-3.3 min) vs 17.0 minutes (IQR, 15.1-17.2 minutes) for the handmade aortic anastomosis performed on the same animals (P = .002). There was no anastomotic leak. Histology showed incorporation of the connector spikes in the aortic wall, without intimal hyperplasia or false aneurysm.

The secondary aim was to compare this with population mobility data obtained from Google. Methods: A cross-sectional study of consecutive adult (> 13 years) patients with musculoskeletal trauma referred as either in-patients or out-patients over a 40-day period beginning on 5 March 2020, the date of the first reported UK COVID-19 death, was performed. This time period encompassed social distancing measures. This group was compared to a group of patients referred over the same calendar period in 2019 and to publicly available mobility data from Google. Results: Orthopaedic trauma referrals reduced by 42% (1,056 compared to 1,820) during the study period, and by 58% (405 compared to 967) following national lockdown. Outpatient referrals reduced by 44%, and inpatient referrals by 36%, and the number of surgeries performed by 36%.

Towards the end of that decade and during the first half of the next, WHO revitalized and played a crucial role in setting global health priorities. However, over the past decade, the organization has to some extent been bypassed for funding, and it lost some of its authority and its ability to set a global health agenda. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted. Some of the main factors include WHO's inability to reform its core structure, the growing influence of non-governmental actors, a lack of coherence in the positions, priorities and funding decisions between the health ministries and the ministries overseeing development assistance in several donor member states, and the lack of strong leadership of the organization.","output":"The World Health Organization and Global Health Governance: post-1990"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Many medical schools and specialist accreditation bodies worldwide have cancelled or postponed professional examinations due to the COVID-19 pandem","output":"Safe Conduct of Professional Examinations During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination plays an important role in the fight against the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, in order to minimize the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its life-threatening complications.

They had undergone minimal somatic mutation with limited clonal expansion, and three bound the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2. The most potent antibody bound the RBD and prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Thus, most anti-S antibodies that were generated in this patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation.

To date, nsP3 has been demonstrated to mediate many virusChost proteinCprotein interactions in several fundamental alphavirus mechanisms, particularly during the early stages of replication. However, the molecular pathways and proteins networks underlying these mechanisms remain poorly described. This is due to the low genetic sequence homology of the nsP3 protein among the alphavirus species, especially at its 3 C-terminal domain, the hypervariable domain (HVD). Moreover, the nsP3 HVD is almost or completely intrinsically disordered and has a poor ability to form secondary structures. Evolution in the nsP3 HVD region allows the alphavirus to adapt to vertebrate and insect hosts. This review focuses on the putative roles and functions of indel, repetition, and duplication events that have occurred in the alphavirus nsP3 HVD, including characterization of the differences and their implications for specificity in the context of virusChost interactions in fundamental alphavirus mechanisms, which have thus directly facilitated the evolution, adaptation, viability, and re-emergence of these viruses.","output":"The Putative Roles and Functions of Indel, Repetition and Duplication Events in Alphavirus Non-Structural Protein 3 Hypervariable Domain (nsP3 HVD) in Evolution, Viability and Re-Emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the misinformation problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of non-expert is exploited.

In our experiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, and to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results on workers behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions, of scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a longitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and experienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and quality change over time. Our results show that workers are able to detect and objectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both crowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve quality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information, behavior) impact the quality of the data.

There were 200 questionnaire respondents, and we analyzed the responses of 189 members who had been involved in COVID-19 treatment in ICUs. The ethical and social issues that HCPs recognized during the pandemic were difficulties in the decision-making process with patients families, limitations of life-sustaining treatment, lack of palliative care, and inadequate mental support for patients families and HCPs. Regarding decision-making on issues of clinical ethics during the pandemic, more than half of the respondents thought they had failed to provide sufficient palliative care to patients and responded that they experienced moral distress. The free-text responses on moral distress revealed issues such as unusual treatment and care, restricted visits, challenging situations for HCPs, and psychological burden. Additionally, 38.1% of respondents experienced episodes of social prejudice or discrimination and 4.7% experienced a shortage of medical resources. Our study result shows that the moral distress of HCPs was caused by difficulties in patient-centered decision-making and insufficient medical care to patients and their families. These were caused mainly by a lack of communication due to the stronger implementation of infection control measures.

Assessment and treatment of COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation may be key to improve outcomes. It was speculated that in subgroups of patients secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with features of macrophage activation syndrome might drive severe disease trajectories. If confirmed, profound immunosuppressive therapy would be a rationale treatment approach. Methods: : Over a median observation period of 11 (IQR: 8;16) days, 19 consecutive confirmed severe COVID-19-patients admitted to our intensive-care-unit were tested for presence of sHLH by two independent experts. HScores and 2004-HLH diagnostic criteria were assessed. Patients were grouped according to short-term clinical courses: discharge from ICU versus ongoing ARDS or death at time of analysis. Results: : The median HScore at admission was 157 (IQR: 98;180), without the key clinical triad of HLH, i.e. progressive cytopenia, persistent fever and organomegaly. Independent expert chart review revealed the absence of sHLH in all cases. No patient reached more than 3/6 of modified HLH 2004 criteria. Nevertheless, patients presented hyperinflammation with peripheral neutrophilic signatures (neutrophil/lymphocyte-ratio>3.5). The latter best paralleled their short-term clinical courses, with declining relative neutrophil numbers prior to extubation (4.4, [IQR: 2.5;6.3];n=8) versus those with unfavourable courses (7.6, [IQR: 5.2;31], n=9).

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. RESULTS Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). CONCLUSIONS Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o..

Would it be ethical to deploy these novel vaccines based only on the safety and immunogenicity data generated by the phase-I and II clinical trials? Would it be ethical to deny vaccination of vulnerable populations against an untreatable infectious disease despite the availability of reasonably safe and efficacious vaccines for the want of phase III trial data? The answer is not straightforward, as there are many complexities involved. This commentary attempts to discuss some ethical issues involved in a decision to deploy Covid-19 vaccination before phase III trial results are declared.","output":"Emergency use authorisation of Covid-19 vaccines: An ethical conundrum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to the biomedical research community at the intersection of great uncertainty due to the novelty of the virus and extremely high stakes due to the large global death count. The global quarantine shut-downs complicated scientific matters because many laboratories were closed down unless they were actively doing COVID-19 related research, making repurposing of activities difficult for many biomedical researchers. Biomedical informaticians, who have been primarily able to continue their research through remote work and video conferencing, have been able to maintain normal activities. In addition to continuing ongoing studies, there has been great grass roots interest in helping in the fight against COVID-19. In this commentary, we describe several projects that arose from this desire to help, and the lessons that the authors learned along the way.

Mass quarantines and social isolation have affected the mental health of the wider population, exacerbating other stressors, including fear of the virus and its repercussions, general uncertainty, and financial insecurity. The pandemic has challenged the broader delivery of healthcareCCranging from the need to triage limited hospital resources to balancing risk mitigation with maintaining medical care. Specific to gastroenterology, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not only been associated with complicating extant medical conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but has also forced a shift in the practice of gastroenterology by patients, families, and healthcare providers alike. The gastroenterology field has been required to adapt its practices to minimize the possibility of viral spread while still upholding patient care. Healthcare practitioners in GI have helped to treat COVID-19 patients, stratified inpatient and outpatient visits and procedures, and shifted to telemedicine. Still, as is the case with much of the general population, healthcare providers working in GI practice or endoscopy have faced personal and professional stressors, mental health difficulties, social isolation, financial pressures, and familial burdensCCall of which can take a toll on practitioners and, by extension, the provision of GI care overall. This article will highlight how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychological wellbeing, social engagement, and economic conditions of the public, healthcare providers, and GI professionals specifically. Recommendations for strategies that can continue GI services while maintaining safety for both caregivers and patients are put forth to help uphold critical GI care during this worldwide crisis.","output":"Psychosocio-economic impacts of COVID-19 on gastroenterology and endoscopy practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critical illness of a child affects all members of the family, including well brothers and sisters.

However, the use of computer-based decision rules in clinical practice is still deficient, mainly due to their complexity and a lack of medical interpretation. The objetive of this research is to address these issues by providing valuable diagnostic rules that can be easily implemented in clinical practice. In this research, efficient diagnostic rules friendly in clinical practice are provided. In this paper, interesting parameters obtained from the ECG signals analysis are presented and two simple rules for automatic diagnosis of Bundle Branch Blocks are defined using new markers derived from the so-called FMMecg delineator. The main advantages of these markers are the good statistical properties and their clear interpretation in clinically meaningful terms. High sensitivity and specificity values have been obtained using the proposed rules with data from more than 35000 patients from well known benchmarking databases. In particular, to identify Complete Left Bundle Branch Blocks and differentiate this condition from subjects without heart diseases, sensitivity and specificity values ranging from 93% to 99% and from 96% to 99%, respectively. The new markers and the automatic diagnosis are easily available at https://fmmmodel.shinyapps.io/fmmEcg/, an app specifically developed for any given ECG signal. The proposal is different from others in the literature and it is compelling for three main reasons. On the one hand, the markers have a concise electrophysiological interpretation. On the other hand, the diagnosis rules have a very high accuracy. Finally, the markers can be provided by any device that registers the ECG signal and the automatic diagnosis is made straightforwardly, in contrast to the black-box and deep learning algorithms.","output":"Compelling new electrocardiographic markers for automatic diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this study, the anxiety levels and sleep qualities of cardiologists who continue to treat cardiac emergency patients in addition to their epidemic duties during the period when the COVID 19 pandemic was the most intense and the unknown was the most in our country. Methods: : This cross-sectional study included 347 cardiologists throughout Turkey from April 17 to 20, 2020. The research was conducted by means of a confidential on-line survey. The research used the Turkish versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 9 Citem Patient Health Questionnaire. Results: Of the total number of respondents, n= 193 (55.6 %) were aged 31 to 40 years and n= 84 ( 24.2%) were women. 79% of the participants were working in tertiary care centers where cardiac patients and covid patients were admitted and treated more.

CPT emerged as a possible and feasible treatment. Transfusion cardiovascular overload (TACO), acute lung injury (TRALI) and anaphylactic reactions (AR) have raised safety concerns; in the other hand, it is still unknown its efficacy but preliminary reports have claimed that if it is delivered early, mortality or morbidity could be decreased. Pediatric use of CPT is emerging from adults studies. OBJECTIVE: To review clinical outcomes, laboratory parameters and side effects of CPT in a single center in Argentina and determine the mortality rate. METHODS: This is a single-center single-arm exploratory-descriptive prospective study, starting on May 1, 2021 until October 31, 2021. A protocol developed for donation of CPT included those individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RT- PCR positive in respiratory secretions and SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive by immunochromatography o chemiluminescence, with a titer by ELISA (Covidar?) > 1:400 and 200 C 250 mL were considered 1 Unit. Recipients weighing <70 kg received 1 unit, and those recipients weighing >70kg received 2 units. CPT was prescribed within 14 days of starting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. All patients received dexamethasone and standard support measures. We used percentages and frequencies for reporting the results of this study. Categorical variables were compared with Chi2 and numeric Fisher/Mann Whitney. Time dependent survival variables were calculated with Kaplan Meier method. SPPS 20 software was used for data processing. RESULTS: The CPT recipients median age (IQR) was 47 years of age (range 43C59 years); 65.5 % were; 12,5% had either hypertension or obesity, 3.1% chronic obstructive lung disease; 30% had diabetes. The median temperature at diagnosed was (IQR) 37.7C (range 36.6C - 38.9C). A total of 39 CPT units were infused in 32 patients. 25 patients (78%) received 1 unit, 6 patients (19%) received 2 units and 1 patient (3%) received 3 units (3%). Donor median (IQR), SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer was 1:400 (range 400C1600); median time (IQR) to transfusion was 1 day (range 1C4). Coverage was 100%. OUTCOMES: 29 patients (91%) survived and 3 (9%) died for COVID-19. Only 3 patients (8%) developed moderate/reversible side effects: allergic reaction (2 pts) and TRALI(1pt) At a median time of 100 days, the median survival was 85% (0.5) and the mortality rate was 19 % (0.6). Laboratory features: CONCLUSION: CPT was feasible to deliver and could be implemented in a less resourced country in a timely fashion. All our patients could afford plasma therapy. No severe adverse events were reported. Pediatric studies can be based on the results of this type of study.

The severity of the global health burden, increasing mortality rate and the emergent economic crisis urgently demands the development of next- generation vaccines. Amongst such emergent next generation vaccines are the multi-epitope subunit vaccines, which hold promise in combating deadly pathogens. In this study we have exploited immunoinformatics applications to delineate a vaccine candidate possessing multiple B and T cells epitopes utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 non structural and structural proteins. The antigenicity potential, safety, structural stability and the production feasibility of the designed construct was evaluated computationally. Furthermore, due to the known crucial interactions of human TLR-3 immune receptor with SARS-CoV, the vaccine construct was examined for its binding efficiency using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, which resulted in strong and stable interactions. Finally, the immune simulation studies suggested an effective immune response on vaccine administration. Overall, the immunoinformatics analysis advocates that the purposed vaccine candidate is safe and immunogenic and therefore can be pushed as a lead for in vitro and in vivo investigations.","output":"Engineering a Multi Epitope Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2 By Exploiting Its Non Structural and Structural Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown measures fundamentally reshaped human society during the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN: Publicly available register-based ecological study. SETTING: Two hundred and nine countries/territories in the world. PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated data including 10 445 656 confirmed COVID-19 cases. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 CFR and crude cause-specific death rate were calculated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website. RESULTS: The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2%C3% worldwide and higher than previously reported at 0.7%C1.3%. A doubling in size of a population is associated with a 0.48% (95% CI 0.25% to 0.70%) increase in COVID-19 CFR, and a doubling in the proportion of female smokers is associated with a 0.55% (95% CI 0.09% to 1.02%) increase in COVID-19 CFR. The open testing policies are associated with a 2.23% (95% CI 0.21% to 4.25%) decrease in CFR. The strictness of anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but the higher Stringency Index was associated with higher CFR in higher-income countries with active testing policies (regression coefficient beta=0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27). Inverse associations were found between cardiovascular disease death rate and diabetes prevalence and CFR. CONCLUSION: The association between population size and COVID-19 CFR may imply the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries with large populations. The observed association between smoking in women and COVID-19 CFR might be due to the finding that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly the income level of a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine and/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations.

This study compared delayed wound healing rates and reoperations between 2 increasingly popular dressings: a silver-impregnated occlusive (standard) dressing and a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive with polyester mesh. Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 431 consecutive THAs performed by 2 surgeons between January 2017 and May 2019. One hundred and eight were excluded for not using standard or mesh dressings. A final 323 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 186) and standard dressings (n = 137). Standard dressings were removed at 1 week. Mesh persisted until nonadherent, approximately 3-4 weeks. The surgeon assessed delayed wound healing at the 2-week postoperative visit. Secondary outcomes include deep infection and return to the operating room for a wound-related diagnosis. Differences were determined using the chi-square test. Results There were no demographic, comorbidity, or surgical differences between groups. There were 22 total cases of delayed wound healing with 7 (3.8%) in the mesh group and 15 (10.9%) in the standard dressing group (P = .01). There were no significant differences in reoperations (2 [1.1%] vs 2 [1.5%], P = .76) or deep infections (2 [1.1%] vs 1 [0.7%], P = .75).

However, there is no research about its effect on mammalian spermatogenesis. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the swim bladder peptides (SBPs) effect on busulfan-induced oligoasthenospermia in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first extracted SBP from protein hydrolysate of the croceine croaker swim bladder, and then five groups of ICR male mice were randomly assigned: control, control + SBP 60 mg/kg, busulfan, busulfan + SBP 30 mg/kg and busulfan + SBP 60 mg/kg. Mice received bilateral intratesticular injections of busulfan to establish oligoasthenospermia model. After treatment with SBP for 4 weeks, testis and epididymis were collected from all mice for further analysis. RESULTS: After treatment with SBP 30-60 mg/kg for 4 weeks, epididymal sperm concentration and motility increased by 3.9-9.6- and 1.9-2.4-fold than those of oligoasthenospermia mice induced by busulfan. Meanwhile, histology showed that spermatogenic cells decreased, leading to increased lumen diameters and vacuolization in the busulfan group. These features were reversed by SBP treatment. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that, compared with the busulfan group, Lin28b and Igf2bp1 expression related to germ cell proliferation, increased with a >1.5-fold change after SBP treatment. Additionally, PGK2 and Cfap69 mRNAs associated with sperm motility, also increased with a >1.5-fold change.

It remains unclear whether the history of cerebrovascular disease is associated with in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. Using our institutional data warehouse, we identified all adult patients who were admitted to the hospital between March 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 and had a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the emergency department. Using our institutional electronic health record, we extracted clinical characteristics of the cohort, including age, sex, and comorbidities. Using multivariable logistic regression to control for medical comorbidities, we modeled the relationship between history of stroke and all-cause, in-hospital death. RESULTS: We identified 3248 patients, of whom 387 (11.9%) had a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke were significantly older, and were significantly more likely to have a history of all medical comorbidities except for obesity, which was more prevalent in patients without a history of stroke. Compared with patients without history of stroke, patients with a history of stroke had higher in-hospital death rates during the study period (48.6% versus 31.7%, P<0.001). In the multivariable analysis, history of stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.01-1.63]) was significantly associated with in-hospital death.

METHODS: The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). FINDINGS: We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. These high impact variant ultimately results in 36 number of mutations on spike glycoprotein. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East. INTERPRETATION: The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants affecting in the region than any other study.","output":"Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Middle East"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multipurpose cash transfers (MPCs) are used on a widespread basis in the Syrian refugee response; however, there is little to no evidence as to how they affect health in humanitarian crises. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 2018 through July 2019 to evaluate the impact of MPCs on health care-seeking and expenditures for child, adult acute, and adult chronic illness by Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Households receiving MPCs from UNHCR were compared to control households not receiving UNHCR MPCs. RESULTS: Care-seeking for childhood illness was consistently high in both MPC and non-MPC households. An increased proportion of households did not receive all recommended care due to cost; this increase was 19.3% greater among MPC recipients than controls (P = 0.002). Increases in child hospitalizations were significantly smaller among MPC recipients than controls (DiD -6.1%; P = 0.037). For adult acute illnesses, care-seeking increased among MPC recipients but decreased in controls (adjusted DiD 11.3%; P = 0.057); differences in change for other utilization outcomes were not significant. The adjusted difference in change in the proportion of MPC households not receiving recommended chronic illness care due to cost compared to controls was ? 28.2% (P = 0.073). Access to medication for adult chronic illness also marginally significantly improved for MPC households relative to controls. The proportion of MPC recipients reporting expenses for the most recent child and adult acute illness increased significantly, as did the [log] total visit cost. Both MPC and control households reported significant increases in borrowing to pay for health expenses over the year study period, but differences in change in borrowing or asset sales were not significant, indicating that MPC was not protective against for household financial risks associated with health. CONCLUSIONS: While MPC may have shown some positive effects, findings were mixed and MPC appears insufficient on its own to address health utilization and expenditures. A broader strategy addressing Syrian refugee health in Lebanon is needed of which MPC should be incorporated, with additional support such as additional conditional cash transfers for health.

In normal metal/ferromagnet bilayers, a concerted action of the interconversions, the spin Hall effect and its inverse effect of normal metals, results in spin Hall magnetoresistance, whose sign is always positive regardless of the sign of spin Hall conductivity of normal metals. Here we report that the spin Hall magnetoresistance of Ta/NiFe bilayers is negative, necessitating an additional interconversion process. Our theory shows that the interconversion owing to interfacial spin-orbit coupling at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces can give rise to negative spin Hall magnetoresistance. Given that recent studies found the conversion from charge currents to spin currents at normal metal/ferromagnet interfaces, our work provides a missing proof of its reciprocal spin-current-to-charge-current conversion at same interface.

METHODS: A total of 612 volunteers between the ages of 18-38 enrolled in the study, 418 of them were athletes engaged in team sports or individual sports and 194 of them were non-athletes. Participants completed the Depression - Anxiety - Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ). Non-parametric methods were used for comparisons between groups. The presence of a linear relationship was tested with the Spearman Correlation Test. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 571 participants, 372 males and 199 females, completed the study. Depression and anxiety symptoms were lower in athletes compared to non-athletes (p < 0.05). Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were similar in team athletes and individual athletes (p = 0.232, p = 0.444, p = 0.116; respectively).

These restrictions are unlikely to prevent cases from surging well beyond existing hospitalisation capacity; not withstanding their likely severe social and economic costs in the long term. We suggest that in low-income countries, time limited movement restrictions should be considered primarily as an opportunity to develop sustainable and resource appropriate mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies, if focused on reducing COVID-19 transmission through a triad of prevention activities, have the potential to mitigate bed demand and mortality by a considerable extent. This triade is based on a combination of high-uptake of community led shielding of high-risk individuals, self-isolation of mild to moderately symptomatic cases, and moderate physical distancing in the community. We outline a set of principles for communities to consider how to support the protection of the most vulnerable, by shielding them from infection within and outside their homes. We further suggest three potential shielding options, with their likely applicability to different settings, for communities to consider and that would enable them to provide access to transmission-shielded arrangements for the highest risk community members. Importantly, any shielding strategy would need to be predicated on sound, locally informed behavioural science and monitored for effectiveness and evaluating its potential under realistic modelling assumptions. Perhaps, most importantly, it is essential that these strategies not be perceived as oppressive measures and be community led in their design and implementation. This is in order that they can be sustained for an extended period of time, until COVID-19 can be controlled or vaccine and treatment options become available.","output":"COVID-19 control in low-income settings and displaced populations: what can realistically be done?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Checkpoint inhibitors are part of the family of immunotherapies and are increasingly being used in a wide variety of cancers.

Therefore, each person needs to determine their skin condition accurately to care for their skin accordingly. Recently, genetic identification by skin-related phenotypes has become possible using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and machine-learning algorithms. However, because most GWAS have focused on populations with American or European skin pigmentation, large-scale GWAS are needed for Asian populations. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of facial phenotypes with candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to predict phenotype from genotype using machine learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 749 Korean women aged 30C50 years were enrolled in this study and evaluated for five facial phenotypes (melanin, gloss, hydration, wrinkle, and elasticity). To find highly related SNPs with each phenotype, GWAS analysis was used. In addition, phenotype prediction was performed using three machine-learning algorithms (linear, ridge, and linear support vector regressions) using five-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Using GWAS analysis, we found 46 novel highly associated SNPs (p < 110(?05)): 3, 20, 12, 6, and 5 SNPs for melanin, gloss, hydration, wrinkle, and elasticity, respectively. On comparing the performance of each model based on phenotypes using five-fold cross-validation, the ridge regression model showed the highest accuracy (r(2) = 0.6422C0.7266) in all skin traits. Therefore, the optimal solution for personal skin diagnosis using GWAS was with the ridge regression model. CONCLUSION: The proposed facial phenotype prediction model in this study provided the optimal solution for accurately predicting the skin condition of an individual by identifying genotype information of target characteristics and machine-learning methods. This model has potential utility for the development of customized cosmetics.","output":"A Genome-Wide Association Study and Machine-Learning Algorithm Analysis on the Prediction of Facial Phenotypes by Genotypes in Korean Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health social media is frequently used by e-patients for seeking health information online for self-diagnosis, self-treatment, and self-education Health social media also provides various benefits for patients and laypersons, such as allowing users to be part of virtual support groups, having quick access to advice, and the convenience of access via the Internet At the same time, it raises concerns about misinformation being propagated by laypersons without professional medical expertise, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, leading to an infodemic There are only a handful of health social media websites that allow medical professionals to participate in discussions with patients online We postulate that the modern face of medicine and healthcare needs medical professionals to be included in the online patient discourse so misinformation can be addressed early on and head on To this end, we propose a new and free health social network named Cardea that is under development which aims to bring patients, laypersons, and medical professionals together on the world wide web Users can share experiences, ask questions, and get answers in three streamlined environments: Patient to Patient (P2P), Patient to Medic (P2M), and Medic to Medic (M2M) While there are several forums that cater specifically to patient-patient discussions or medic-medic connections, Cardeas added value is in providing a unified portal for both patients and medics, as well as enabling interactions between patients and medics Moreover, Cardea applies machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing methods to promote credible health information and demote misinformation At the same time, with enhanced veracity, anonymity, and privacy controls, the vision of Cardea is for e-patients to confidently share experiences and opinions without being stigmatized or compromising their right to privacy Our hope is to generate discussion and gather insights from other researchers on developing Cardea Copyright ? 2021 by SCITEPRESS C Science and Technology Publications, Lda All rights reserved","output":"The need for medical professionals to join patients in the online health social media discourse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world","output":"A critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and ecosystems and opportunities for circular economy strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a mathematical model of disease (say a virus) spread that takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in a population.

Decades of research demonstrate that uninsured people and people with copays and deductibles use less care than people with first-dollar coverage. Hence, most economic analyses of Medicare for All proposals and other coverage expansions project increased utilization and associated costs. We review the utilization surges that such analyses have predicted and contrast them with the more modest utilization increments observed after past coverage expansions in the US and other affluent nations. The discrepancy between predicted and observed utilization changes suggests that analysts underestimate the role of supply-side constraints-for example, the finite number of physicians and hospital beds. Our review of the utilization effects of past coverage expansions suggests that a first-dollar universal coverage expansion would increase ambulatory visits by 7-10 percent and hospital use by 0-3 percent. Modest administrative savings could offset the costs of such increases.","output":"Pricing Universal Health Care: How Much Would The Use Of Medical Care Rise?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection can associate diverse neurological manifestations. Several studies have provided proof to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. Alpha-synuclein has been described as a native antiviral factor within neurons, and upregulation of this protein can be seen in animals that suffered other neuroinvasive infections. To assess if increased expression of this protein takes place in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms, we analyzed serum total alpha-synuclein levels in three groups: seven COVID-19 patients with myoclonus, Parkinsonism and/or encephalopathy; thirteen age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without neurological involvement and eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We did not find differences among them. In a subset of four patients, the change in serum alpha-synuclein before and after the onset of neurological symptoms was not significant either. Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein levels were also similar between neurological COVID-19 and healthy controls. Overall, these results cannot support the hypothesis of alpha-synuclein upregulation in humans with neurological symptoms in COVID-19.

The introduction of the increased tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), popularly called sugar tax (ST), and a mandatory programme of vaccinations are the strategies inciting the most vivid discussions in Polish society. The study was intended to assess the determinants of the attitudes of Polish society regarding the ST and to vaccinations. Methods: For the analysis, the data originating from the survey of a representative adult sample of Polish society (n = 1000) was used. The survey was based on computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). The assessment of the relationships between the selected variables and the opinions about the introduction of the ST and the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations were carried out using the chi(2) test and univariate logistic regression models. Results: The acceptance of the ST and vaccination showed a significant relationship to the level of health literacy (HL) but not to eHealth literacy (eHL). Respondents having a higher rather than lower HL; older rather than younger; married rather than singles; retired, or on a disability pension, rather than vocationally active and nonusers of the Internet rather than users were more likely to show an acceptance for both interventions. Those more frequently using health care services and those with chronic diseases showed a greater belief in the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. Conclusions: The relationship between the opinions of the two public health interventions analysed and the sociodemographic variables demonstrated similar patterns. Interestingly, the opinions were associated only with HL and not with eHL and users of the Internet were more sceptical about the interventions.","output":"The Acceptance of Key Public Health Interventions by the Polish Population Is Related to Health Literacy, But Not eHealth Literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Most adults receiving mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) exhibit IgG antibodies (Ab) targeting the S1 spike protein within a week of dose 2. However, correlates of protection are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to better quantify the % of neutralizing Ab (nAb) that develop after dose 2 and also identify factors affecting the timing and degree of nAb production. METHODS: Using a fluorescence immunoassay to quantify the % of SCV2-Ab capable of blocking S1 at its receptor binding domain (for attaching to ACE-2 receptors), residents/ staff (n=70;ages 23-100 yrs) of an assisted living facility had blood samples measured on day 7 and 21 following dose 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Based on existing research, %nAb < 30% is delineated as inadequate protection (nAb negative). RESULTS: Except for a 58 yo man taking daily prednisone (asthma) and a 55 yo man on levothyroxine, 100% of those < 70 yrs (n=33) were nAb+ (>30% nAb) on day 7 after dose 2. However, if >70 yo (n=37), the % of nAb+ findings diminished with age. Only half of those 71-80 yo, 33% of those 81-90 yo and 11% of those >90 yo were nAb+. Nonetheless, 2 weeks later, the %+ among those tested had increased to 83%, 71%, and 50% for those respective age groups. When examining the average of nAb% measurements within each of the various age group stratifications 1 week after dose 2, the averages ranged 96-100% for the 3 age groups < 50 years (ie, 23-30, 31-40 and 41-50), while the age group averages were borderline or inadequate for those >70 yo. However, 21 days after dose 2, the average %nAb measurement had become 91% for those 61 to 70 years of age, 75% for those 71-80, and 55% for those 81-90. For persons > 90 yo (n=8), the average %nAb was 35% but half of those persons (n=4) had no detectable nAb, either at day 7 or day 21. No persons had any significant declines in %nAb between Day 7 and 21 and the majority sustained or improved their %nAb. CONCLUSIONS: Escalating age and immunomodulating medications/conditions do impact the timing and degree of nAb developing after mRNA vaccination. Most persons < 90 yo are observed to be positive for protective levels of nAb by 3 weeks after dose 2. On-going investigations are addressing the duration and sustained degree of nAb+ findings as well as external validation of the tool used in this research.","output":"Timing and degree of neutralizing antibody development after pfizer-biontech vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to find out if Christians experience God's silence and if so, what are its correlates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second purpose of the study was to identify the connections between the experience of God's silence and depressive mood disorders and the impact of God's silence on other spiritual experiences. The study was conducted online on a group of 771 people, mostly Christians. The experience of God's silence was declared by 82.1% of the respondents. This experience does not depend on the sex of the respondents, but correlates with their age. The experience of God's silence is commensurate with the joy that comes from having a relationship with God through daily spiritual experiences. Additionally, the conducted research shows that experience of God's silence resembles a state rather than a permanent feature with a visible ending, which is associated with a change in the image of God. The consequences of experiencing God's silence need not to be negative. The conducted research shows that the most frequently mentioned effect of this experience is the strengthening and consolidation of faith.

Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care professional households, single-parent health care professional households, and households with health care professionals responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the looming threat of illness to one or both partners, the potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency.

Ever since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic preventive action was comprehensively upgraded worldwide. This prompted South African authorities to implement physical distancing, self-isolation, closure of non-essential services, schools, travelling restrictions and recursive national lockdowns to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This explanatory study sought to review the effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. METHODS: The study applied literature research of COVID-19 reports, policies from the National Department of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, and articles from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. RESULTS: The South African health system is affected by the lack of PPEs, increased mortality rates, mental health problems, substance abuse, resurgent of NCDs. The closure of international borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during lockdown cause socio-economic problems. The prolonged effects of lockdown on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of uncertainties, acute panic, fear, depression, obsessive behaviours, social unrests, stigmatization, anxiety, increased gender-based violence cases and discrimination in the distribution of relief food aid.

Evaluation of the effects of the vaccination regimes of COVID-19 is critical for understanding the potential capacity of countermeasures and informing subsequent prioritization strategies of responses. Research and observational data provide broad support regarding the importance of effective vaccines, in contrast, debates remain on the timing and priority of booster vaccination under the assumption of resource constraint. This study aims to evaluate the effect of vaccination regimes on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic from the medium-term perspective. We employ a mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, thereafter perform simulation on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic up to 3 years. The outcomes imply that in the absence of severe variants of the pathogen, administration of booster vaccination curtails the peak size of total cases and share of severe infections at later waves. Nevertheless, it can be better off by prioritizing the primary doses to unvaccinated individuals when vaccine shortage is challenged. The effects of priority categories are consistent across a broad range of profiles. Increasing the rollout capacity (i.e., administration rate) of doses can render the reproduction number lower than one and hence contain the transmission of pandemic ultimately controlling for other factors. The timing of rollout of primary doses is pivotal in reducing the magnitude of transmission saturation. It is of importance to prioritize the administration of primary vaccination series to vulnerable individuals efficiently and thereafter increment of administration capacity when the supply of vaccine increases over time to scale down the size of an epidemic.","output":"Evaluation of the effects of vaccination regimes on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaders must train in technology use and build a portfolio of competencies that mark a rapidly emerging future.

The utility of self-management has been proven in certain chronic conditions. However, very little work has been undertaken regarding self-management in people with dementia. METHODS: The SHAPE trial will include 372 people with mild to moderate dementia to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an educational programme combining approaches of self-management, health promotion, and e-learning for care partners. The study is a multi-site, single-randomised, controlled, single-blinded trial with parallel arms. The intervention arm is compared with treatment as usual. The intervention comprises a 10-week course delivered as group sessions for the participants with dementia. The sessions are designed to develop self-management skills and to provide information on the nature of the condition and the development of healthy behaviours in a supportive learning environment. An e-learning course will be provided for care partners which covers similar and complementary material to that discussed in the group sessions for the participant with dementia.

Unlike eIF4G1, eIF4G2 does not interact with the cap-binding protein eIF4E and is believed to drive translation under stress when eIF4E activity is impaired. Here, we show that eIF4G2 operates under normal conditions as well and promotes scanning downstream of the eIF4G1-mediated 40S recruitment and cap-proximal scanning. Specifically, eIF4G2 facilitates leaky scanning for a subset of mRNAs. Apparently, eIF4G2 replaces eIF4G1 during scanning of 5' UTR and the necessity for eIF4G2 only arises when eIF4G1 dissociates from the scanning complex. In particular, this event can occur when the leaky scanning complexes interfere with initiating or elongating 80S ribosomes within a translated uORF. This mechanism is therefore crucial for higher eukaryotes which are known to have long 5' UTRs with highly frequent uORFs. We suggest that uORFs are not the only obstacle on the way of scanning complexes towards the main start codon, because certain eIF4G2 mRNA targets lack uORF(s). Thus, higher eukaryotes possess two distinct scanning complexes: the principal one that binds mRNA and initiates scanning, and the accessory one that rescues scanning when the former fails.","output":"Ribosomal leaky scanning through a translated uORF requires eIF4G2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast and effective detection of epidemics is the key to preventing the spread of diseases. In this work, we constructed a dual-wavelength ratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on entropy-driven and bipedal DNA walker cycle amplification strategies for detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The entropy-driven cyclic amplification reaction was started by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene to generate a bandage. The bandage could combine with two other single-stranded S1 and S2 to form a bipedal DNA walker to create the following cycle reaction. After the bipedal DNA walker completed the walking process, the hairpin structures at the top of the DNA tetrahedrons (TDNAs) were removed. Subsequently, the PEI-Ru@Ti(3)C(2)@AuNPs-S7 probes were used to combine with the excised hairpin part of TDNAs on the surface of Au-g-C(3)N(4), and the signal change was realized employing electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET). By combining entropy-driven and DNA walker cycle amplification strategy, the ratiometric ECL biosensor exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 7.8 aM for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. As a result, detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene in human serum still possessed high recovery so that the dual-wavelength ratiometer biosensor could be used in early clinical diagnosis.","output":"Rational engineering the DNA tetrahedrons of dual wavelength ratiometric electrochemiluminescence biosensor for high efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene by using entropy-driven and bipedal DNA walker amplification strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of distance education in primary schools has become a much-discussed topic.

Methods: In summer 2020 and 2021, we surveyed participants enrolled in the Biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM, N = 180,599) about their experience with COVID-19. Prevalence of testing, symptoms, and the impacts of COVID-19 on employment, family life, and physical and mental health were calculated overall and by demographic categories. Using the Electronic Health Record (EHR), we compared COVID-19 case ascertainment and characteristics in the EHR versus the survey. Results: Of the 25,063 survey respondents (13.9%), 42.5% had been tested for COVID-19 and of those, 12.8% tested positive. Nearly half of those tested had symptoms and/or had been exposed to someone who was infected. Young adults (18-29 years) and Hispanics were more likely to have positive tests compared to older adults and persons of other racial/ethnic groups. Mental health (54.6%) and family life (48.8%) were most negatively affected by the pandemic and more so among younger groups and women; negative impacts on employment were more commonly reported among Black respondents. After integration with EHR data up to the time of the survey completion, 4.0% of survey respondents (n=1,006) had discordant COVID-19 case status between the EHR and the survey. Using all longitudinal EHR and survey data, we identified 11,472 COVID-positive cases among Biobank participants (6.4%). In comparison to COVID-19 cases identified through the survey, EHR-identified cases were younger and more likely to be Hispanic.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. RESULTS: This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay.

Clinically, however, the benefits of single-port TEP (SP TEP) are unclear. This study aimed to compare short-term surgical outcomes between SP TEP and conventional laparoscopic TEP(CL TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Between January 2013 and February 2015, 99 men with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to the single-port or conventional 3-port TEP procedures. The primary end point was postoperative pain. Secondary end points were complications, postoperative hospital stay, days to return to daily normal activities, cosmesis, and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS We randomized 50 patients to SP TEP and 49 to CL TEP repair. The SP TEP group patients had significantly lower pain scores (visual analog scale) 7 days postoperation (p = 0.017). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative pain scores 24 h (p = 0.44) and 4 weeks (p = 0.677) after operation and analgesic requirements on the operation day (p = 0.303) and 7 days after the operation (p = 0.204). Operation time, postoperative hospital stay, and complications were comparable between the two groups. The days to return to daily normal activities, QOL, and cosmetic satisfaction were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION The outcomes of SP TEP hernia repair for operation time and morbidities were comparable to CL TEP, and postoperative pain was lower at 7 days than in CL TEP hernia repair. The SP TEP technique can be recommended as an alternative treatment for inguinal hernia repair in experienced hands.","output":"Single-port versus conventional three-port laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"THE AIM OF THE STUDY: Is to present the state of knowledge from April and May 2020 about the influence of Bacillus-Calmette-Gurin vaccination against tuberculosis on incidence and mortality due to COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. PubMed and ResearchGate databases and WHO reports were used. RESULTS: Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.","output":"The influence of vaccination against tuberculosis with the Bacillus-Calmette-Gurin(BCG) vaccine on COVID-19 incidence and mortality - review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the parent-reported screen time of children, identify the perceived risk factors for increased screen time and its relationship to psychological distress in children. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A cross sectional study was conducted at a teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 230 employees from medical and non-medical departments were included. Participants were employees with child/children ages 4-12 year who consented to participate in the study, we included 135 fathers and 91 mothers. The questionnaire included (i) demographic data (ii) Media history exam form and (iii) parent reported strength and difficult questionnaire (SDQ). RESULT: The average daily screen time reported was 2.5 (1.5-5) hour for boys and 2 (1-4) hour for girls. Preschoolers had greater screen time as compared to school-aged children (Median (IQR): 3 (1.5-5.6) vs 2 (1-4), P = 0.46). The children owned devices with approximately equal distribution of preschoolers and school-aged children (19 (27.1%) and 48 (30%), P = 0.661 respectively). Emotional score was found higher in school-aged group in comparison to preschoolers (p = 0.036). Moreover, mother screen time and number of devices owned by a child were found to be positively associated with child's screen time. CONCLUSION: We conclude that as we are embracing the digital age providing a tech free zone to children is virtually impossible. Children screen time related activities in our part of the world exceeds the limitation.

Numerous studies have assessed the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on child immunization around the world. There are few such studies in Afghanistan, however. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors influencing vaccination status among children age 12-23 months in Afghanistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nationally representative data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey were used for this study. A sample of 5,708 children age 12-23 months with a vaccine card and immunization history was analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify significant relationships between cofactors and vaccination status. RESULTS: In the study, 51% the subjects were boys, 48% were born at home, and 76% were residents of rural areas. Background characteristics positively associated with vaccination status included delivery in a health facility (RRR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.9-3.3), maternal age of 30-39 years (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.1), attending at least four visits for antenatal care (RRR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.7-4.5), health facility visit in the past 12 months (RRR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), paternal professional occupation (RRR = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.0-12.3), family with richer wealth index (RRR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-4.1), and living in the northeast region (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-3.9)were positively associated with vaccination status. Living in the southern region (RRR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.5) was negatively associated with vaccination status. CONCLUSION: This study identified maternal age, ANC visits, place of delivery, health facility visits in past 12 months, paternal occupation, wealth quintile, and geographic region as the factors influencing child's vaccination status in Afghanistan.","output":"Factors influencing vaccination coverage among children age 12-23 months in Afghanistan: Analysis of the 2015 Demographic and Health Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Training is the backbone of any public health program and it is true for a vast program like TB.

However, the mechanisms of adaptation of their gut microbiome and metabolic systems in the degradation of lignocellulose are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a multi-omics analysis on bamboo rats to investigate the interaction between their gut microbiomes and metabolic systems in the pre- and post-weaning periods, and observed significant relationships between dietary types, gut microbiome, serum metabolome and host gene expression. For comparison, published gut microbial data from the famous bamboo-eating giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) were also used for analysis. We found that the adaptation of the gut microbiome of the bamboo rat to a lignocellulose diet is related to a member switch in the order Bacteroidales from family Bacteroidaceae to family Muribaculaceae, while for the famous bamboo-eating giant panda, several aerobes and facultative anaerobes increase after weaning. The conversion of bacteria with an increased relative abundance in bamboo rats after weaning enriched diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) associated with lignocellulose degradation and functionally enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids and B vitamins. Meanwhile, the circulating concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived metabolites and the metabolic capacity of linoleic acid in the host were significantly elevated. Our findings suggest that fatty acid metabolism, including linoleic acid and SCFAs, are the main energy sources for bamboo rats in response to the low-nutrient bamboo diet.","output":"Adaptation of gut microbiome and host metabolic systems to lignocellulosic degradation in bamboo rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Web-based experimental testing has seen exponential growth in psychology and cognitive neuroscience.

There is hardly any country in any of the seven continents of the world where this virus has not spread out. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak as pandemic. Since then, with the aim of curbing the spread of this infection, many governments have been implementing lockdowns in their respective countries, along with a number of new and altogether different rules and regulations in various aspects like travelling to abroad or even interstate journeys. Many instructions are being given to the citizens so as to avoid this infection. Out of these, frequent handwashing, wearing a mask, and social distancing are the three golden rules. Aims and Objectives: After permission from Screening Ethical Committee of the Institute, this study was carried out having the novel idea to assess the awareness about the various concepts regarding the proper use of masks among the frontline health workers, that is, medicos and paramedicos, amidst this corona virus (CoV) pandemic. Materials and Methods: The participation was purely volunteer in this cross-sectional study. In this online survey, a total of 490 subjects participated. The subjects were asked to fill one questionnaire that included a total of 21 questions, out of which actually 17 questions were actually to assess the knowledge about masks.

Given the rarity of diagnosis of clitoral melanoma, there is a paucity of data guiding management. There is no supporting evidence that radical vulvectomy (with or without inguinal lymphadenopathy) is associated with improved disease-free or overall survival compared to partial vulvectomy or wide local excision. Additionally, there is no data to evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy or extensive lymphadenectomy in clitoral melanoma, however previous evidence demonstrates the utility of regional lymph node sampling in predicting survival in women with female genital tract mucosal melanoma. Adjuvant therapy considerations are often extrapolated from their use in treating cutaneous melanomas, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapy agents. Adjuvant radiation therapy has limited utility except in cases of bulky, unresectable disease, or when inguinal lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. The 52 year-old patient presented in this review was diagnosed with locally invasive advanced stage clitoral melanoma presenting as an exophytic clitoral mass. She underwent diagnostic primary tumor resection, which demonstrated ulcerative melanoma with spindle cell features extending to a Breslow depth of at least 28 mm. She subsequently underwent secondary wide local excision with groin sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA over a period of 27 days. The presence, extent, and severity of PTD were documented. Two observers scored the pattern and extent of lung parenchymal disease including potential fibrotic features, as well as lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Consensus was achieved via a third observer. Interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics. Student's t-test, chi-squared, and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA imaging. Ninety-three studies were analysed, excluding indeterminate CTPA examinations. Overall incidence of PTD was 41/93 (44%) with 28/93 patients showing small vessel PTD (30%). D-dimer was elevated in 90/93 (96.8%) cases. A high Wells' score did not differentiate between PTD and non-PTD groups (p=0.801). The interobserver agreement was fair (kappa=0.659) for parenchymal patterns and excellent (kappa=0.816) for severity. Thirty-four of the 93 cases (36.6%) had lymph node enlargement; 29/34 (85.3%) showed no additional source of infection. Sixteen of the 93 (17.2%) cases had potential fibrotic features. CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA and lack of a risk stratification tool. The present data indicates a higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Yet the sheer magnitude and uniqueness of this event has also spawned a massive mobilization of effort in the scientific community to investigate the virus, to develop therapeutics and vaccines, and to understand the public health impacts. Structural biology has been at the center of these efforts, and so it is advantageous to take an opportunity to reflect on the status of structural science vis-a-vis its role in the fight against COVID-19, to register the unprecedented response and to contemplate the role of structural biology in addressing future outbreak threats. As the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization declaration that COVID-19 is a pandemic has just passed, over 1000 structures of SARS-CoV-2 biomolecules have been deposited in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is rare to obtain a snapshot of such intense effort in the structural biology arena and is of special interest as the 50th anniversary of the PDB is celebrated in 2021.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study between April 16th and May 7th 2020 using online questionnaires. METHODS: The sample was reweighted to be representative of the French population by age and sex, region and education level. Ordered logistic, logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to estimate the factors associated with quarantine support, with the opinion on quarantine extension, with the number and type of trips outside the quarantine home and with the acceptability and potential use of a contact-tracing application. RESULTS: After reweighting, full data for regression analyses were available for 1849 respondents. Attitudes and opinions regarding quarantine are correlated with the perceived COVID-19 threat, the perceived benefits of quarantine, trust in the government, well-being during quarantine and risk preferences. Trust in the government, perceived individual health consequences in case of COVID-19 infection and time preferences are associated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that prevention campaigns that stress the individual risk in case of infection or the benefits of quarantine could foster compliance to quarantine protocols. Remote psychological support might also promote quarantine adherence among individuals most distressed by the quarantine. Moreover, public communications should focus on restoring trust among the population as trust is strongly correlated with the willingness to use a contact-tracing application.","output":"Attitudes and opinions on quarantine and support for a contact-tracing application in France during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Background: The interval between inpatient hospitalization for symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and post-discharge office consultation is a vulnerable period for adverse events. Tools to help guide patients during this susceptible time are needed. Methods: To determine whether a smartphone application (app) deployed following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can safely improve the transition to ambulatory care, we customized content on a digital health platform for hospitalized patients receiving PCI which included education, tracking, reminders and live health coaches. We conducted a single-arm open-label pilot study of the app at two academic medical centers in a single health system, with subjects enrolled 02/2018-05/2019 and 1:3 propensity-matched historical controls from 01/2015-12/2017. To evaluate feasibility and efficacy, we assessed 30-day hospital readmission (primary), outpatient cardiovascular follow-up, and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment as recorded in the health system. Outcomes were assessed by Cox Proportional Hazards model. Results: 1676 patients were excluded due to pre-specified criteria including medical complexity, language barrier, and elderly age. 118 of 324 eligible (36.4%) 21-85 year-old patients who underwent PCI for either symptomatic CAD or acute coronary syndrome and who owned a smartphone or tablet enrolled. Mean age was 62.5 (9.7) years, 87 (73.7%) were male, 40 of 118 (33.9%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 68 (57.6%) enrolled underwent PCI for MI and 59 (50.0%) had previously known CAD; demographics were similar among matched historical controls. No significant difference existed in all-cause readmission within 30 days (8.5% app vs 9.6% control, p=0.699) or 90 days (16.1% app vs 19.5% control, p=0.394).

General information and data on clinical characteristics were collected from patients' medical records. Participants' responses to self-report measures of psychological status were also collected. Results: Anxiety levels, depression levels, and recovery rates were significantly higher among women compared to men. Conversely, chronic disease history and smoking rates, dry cough incidence, C-reactive protein levels, and disease severity were significantly higher among men than women (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Female patients experienced more severe psychological issues, due to higher levels of anxiety and stress, than male patients; indicating that more attention should be paid to the psychological care of female patients. In contrast, the general condition of male patients was more severe, particularly among elderly male patients with a history of chronic disease and smoking, suggesting that, to prevent and control 2019-nCoV infection, male patients should be encouraged to quit smoking as soon as possible to reduce the risk of severe pneumonia.","output":"Association of Gender With Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With 2019-nCoV Infection in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to identify the management practices and priorities best suited to present-day workforce needs.Design/methodology/approachFrom 19 March to 6 April 2021, Dare Worldwide conducted linear regression analysis aimed at understanding the key drivers of employee performance.

To that end, we sought to determine the racial impact on PCa surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: After receiving institutional review board approval, the Pennsylvania Urologic Regional Collaborative (PURC) database was queried to evaluate practice patterns for Black and White patients with untreated non-metastatic PCa during the initial lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) compared to prior (March-May 2019). PURC is a prospective collaborative, which includes private practice and academic institutions within both urban and rural settings including regional safety-net hospitals. As data entry was likely impacted by the pandemic, we limited our search to only practices that had data entered through June 1, 2020 (5 practice sites). We compared patient and disease characteristics by race using Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square to compare categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum to evaluate continuous covariates. Patients were stratified by risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection as described by the CDC. We determined the covariate-adjusted impact of year and race on surgery, using logistic regression models with a race?year interaction term. Results: 647 men with untreated nonmetastatic PCa were identified, 269 during the pandemic and 378 from the year prior. During the pandemic, Black men were significantly less likely to undergo prostatectomy compared to White patients (1.3% v 25.9%;p < 0.001), despite similar COVID-19 risk-factors, biopsy Gleason grade group, and comparable surgery rates prior (17.7% vs. 19.1%;p = 0.75). White men had lower pre-biopsy PSA (7.2 vs. 8.8 vs. p = 0.04) and were older (24.4% vs. 38.2% < 60yr;p = 0.09). The regression model demonstrated an 94% decline in odds of surgery(OR = 0.06 95%CI 0.007-0.43;p = 0.006) for Black patients and increase odds of surgery for White patients (OR = 1.41 95%CI 0.89-2.21;p = 0.142), after adjusting for covariates. Changes in surgical volume varied by site (33% increase to complete shutdown), with sites that experienced the largest reduction in cancer surgery, caring for a greater proportion of Black patients. Conclusions: In a large multi-institutional regional collaborative, odds of PCa surgery declined only among Black patients during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. While localized prostate cancer does not require immediate treatment, the lessons from this study illuminate systemic inequities within healthcare, likely applicable across oncology.

The trading processes on the futures market are being intensively digitalized and so the post-pandemic transformation of the market is causing market players seeking to hedge risks to change their behavior. Changes that occurred on the debt capital market during the pandemic have increased investors interest in international derivatives market instruments and sped up the transformation of regional features of the derivatives market. These changes are mainly caused by the spread of the coronavirus infection and its impact on the global economy, which contributes to the development of digital technologies as instruments of interregional trade. International economic activity has been transformed by the opening and closing cycles of the economies of different countries, which affects the logistics and business processes of economic agents. The transformation of economic activity manifested in structural shifts occurring on the derivatives markets is confirmed by the changes in the dynamics of underlying assets of the derivatives market, such as stock indices, stocks, commodities, currencies, interest rates and ETFs.

This reverberated in the field of radiation oncology, with a recent American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) nationwide survey reporting 89% of surveyed clinics began to offer telemedicine programs to patients because of the pandemic. However, this survey did not study the perceptions and experiences of those clinicians delivering telemedicine services. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We investigated through a national physician survey the merits and limitations of radiation oncology tele-consultations. An anonymous web-based survey was distributed using SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com) via email. RESULTS: Seventy six respondents (16.1% overall response rate) completed the survey, with broad representation from both academic and community-based practices. Many respondents agreed that transitioning to tele-consultations was a needed step given the emergence of the pandemic, despite most having never previously offered this service. Despite many radiation oncologists having little prior experience with tele-consultations, a majority were satisfied in being able to explain the details of a medical diagnosis, provide results of imaging and bloodwork, and discuss recommendations around radiation treatments through this format. Nearly half of the respondents agreed that tele-consultations felt impersonal, with the inability to complete physical examinations noted as a contributor to the impersonality. Nevertheless, respondents still agreed that telemedicine will play an important role going forward, and almost 90% agreed that they would offer tele-consultations even after the pandemic has resolved.","output":"A National Survey of Radiation Oncology Experiences Completing Tele-Consultations During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 is a new highly infectious disease with an incompletely described clinical course, which has caused a pandemic, with Europe being identified as the third epicentre.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment option for the majority of PID. As a Pediatric Hematology-Oncology-Immunology Transplantation Unit, we wanted to present our HSCT experience regarding treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. METHODS 58 patients were included in the study between January 2014 and June 2019. We searched 9/10 or 10/10 matched-related donor (MRD) firstly, in the absence of fully matched-related donor. We screened matched unrelated donor (MUD) from donor banks. MRD was used in 24 (41.3%) patients, MUD in 20 (34.4%) patients, and haploidentical donors in 14 (24.1%) patients. Demographic data, HSCT characteristics, and outcome were evaluated. While 16 patients had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the remaining was non-SCID. RESULTS Of the 58 patients, 38 were male and 20 were female. Median age at transplantation was 12 months (range: 2.5-172 months). Combined immunodeficiencies consisted 67.2% of patients. Mean follow-up time was 27 months (6 months-5 years). Median neutrophil, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte engraftment days were similar in comparison of both donor type and stem cell source. The most common complication was acute GvHD in 15 (25.8%) patients. In total, five patients (31%) belonging to the SCID group and 10 patients (23.8%) belonging to the non-SCID group died.

However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals. Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations in public places to show hotspots of infection.

The detection of antibodies serves several purposes, including supporting other assays for disease diagnosis, conducting seroepidemiological studies, and evaluating vaccines. Many platforms of immunological methods for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection and their performance require validation. METHODS: This study evaluated the test performance of three autoanalyzer-based assays (Architect IgG, Vitros IgG, and Vitros total Ig) and one manual ELISA (Wantai total Ig) against a microneutralization (microNT) assay on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Furthermore, an indirect immunofluorescence assay verified the discordant results between the microNT and commercial assays. The test sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were determined based on four groups of 1005 serum samples: 102 COVID-19 prepandemic sera, 45 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive sera, 366 sera of people at risk, and 492 sera of citizens returning from countries with a high prevalence of infection. RESULTS: The analyses as a whole showed that the performance of these commercial assays was comparable. Each group was also analysed separately to gain further insight into test performance. The Architect did not detect two positive sera of people at risk (prevalence of infection 0.55%). The other methods correctly identified these two positive sera but yielded varying false-positive results. The group of returning travellers with an infection rate of 28.3% (139 of 492) better differentiated the test performance of individual assays. CONCLUSIONS: High-throughput Architect and Vitros autoanalyzers appear appropriate for working on large sample sizes in countries that can afford the cost.

METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 164 eyes from 114 patients over 20 years of age with at least 1.5 diopters (D) of myopic astigmatism were treated by SMILE. Any cyclotorsion was manually compensated by gently rotating the cone to align the horizontal marks on the cornea to the 0 to 180 axis of the reticule after activating the suction. RESULTS The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.32.01 D, and the mean cylinder was -2.010.67 D. Three months after surgery, a total of 87% of eyes were within0.50 D of attempted post-operative SE, and 98% of eyes were within1.00 D. Overall, the predictability of cylinder correction was excellent, with 96.3% of eyes within1.00 D of attempted post-operative cylinder. The mean postoperative cylinder at three months was -0.30.39 D. We noted a slight undercorrection with treatment of high cylinder.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that may predispose patients with COVID-19 to severe disease that requires mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: We performed a retrospective audit of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia to the intensive care unit (ICU) and medical wards to evaluate the potential associations between comorbid conditions, lymphopenia and IgG subclass deficiency with a need for MV. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study. Almost half of the patients (47%; n=24) were documented to have IgG2 deficiency, 43% (n=22) had lymphopenia and 37% (n=19) had combined lymphopenia and IgG2 subclass deficiency. Of the 24 patients who required MV, 75% had IgG2 subclass deficiency, 73% had lymphopenia and 50% had both. The relative risk for requiring MV was 2.64, 3.38 and 2.81 for lymphopenia, IgG2 subclass deficiency and both, respectively.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, this cohort study analyzed health care use between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2018, in a retrospective cohort of Medicaid and Medicaid-ineligible (>90% undocumented) adult and pediatric patients. The inflection point of interest was June 16, 2015, the date of Donald Trumps announcement of candidacy, which represented a documented increase in anti-immigration rhetoric during the presidential campaign. Analyses were controlled for age, self-reported sex, and baseline comorbidities. Data analysis was conducted from August 28, 2018, to September 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The DID of the number of completed primary care encounters before and after June 16, 2015, in Medicaid compared with Medicaid-ineligible patients. Secondary outcomes included the DID of emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient discharges over the same period. RESULTS: There were 20 211 patients included in the analysis: 1501 (7.4%) in the sample of predominantly undocumented Medicaid-ineligible patients (861 [57.4%] female) and 18 710 (92.6%) in the Medicaid control group (10 443 [55.8%] female). The mean (SD) age as of 2018 in the Medicaid-ineligible group was 38.2 (15.4) years compared with 22.2 (16.5) years in the control group. There was a differential decrease in completed visits among Medicaid-ineligible children compared with Medicaid children (DID estimate, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9) and Medicaid-ineligible adults (DID estimate, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.8-0.9). There was also a significant differential increase in ED visits among Medicaid-ineligible children (DID estimate, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0). In addition, there was a differential decrease in inpatient discharges among Medicaid-ineligible adults (DID estimate, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7), with no significant change in ED visits or ED admission rates in this group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, there was a significant decrease in primary care use among undocumented patients during a period of increased anti-immigrant rhetoric associated with the 2016 presidential campaign, coincident with an increase in ED visits among children and a decrease in inpatient discharges among adults, with the latter possibly attributed to a decrease in elective admissions during this period.","output":"Changes in Health Care Use Among Undocumented Patients, 2014-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We used routine care data from 51 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.8 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (CTC group) versus standard of care (no-CTC group) among adults 18 to 80 years old with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was intubation or death by day 28. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 891 patients included in the analysis, 203 were assigned to the CTC group. Use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with risk of intubation or death by day 28 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39) or cumulative death rate (wHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.98). However, use of corticosteroids was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death by day 28 in the prespecified subgroups of patients requiring oxygen &#8805; 3 L/min (wHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85) or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L (wHR 0.44, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.85).

CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the use of corticosteroids and intubation or death in the broad population of patients 18 to 80 years old with COVID-19 hospitalized in non-intensive care unit settings. However, the treatment was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death for patients with &#8805; 3 L/min oxygen or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L at baseline.

The acidity of PJ and POMxl solutions contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity, but this was not a factor with POMxp.

However, the antiviral activity was less against a coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses derived from avian isolates. The loss of influenza infectivity was frequently accompanied by loss of hemagglutinating activity. PP treatment decreased Ab binding to viral surface molecules, suggesting some coating of particles, but this did not always correlate with loss of infectivity.

This study is based on the sequencing data to analyze the changes in gene expression of cardiomyocytes and macrophages after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and explore the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the heart and immune system. METHODS: The public data set GSE151879 was retrieved. The online software Network Analyst was used to preprocess the data, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [log2(fold change)>2, adjusted P-value<0.05] screening between the infection group and the control group in cardiomyocytes, human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, and macrophages were screened. Consistent common differentially expressed genes (CCDEGs) with the same expression pattern in cardiomyocytes and macrophages were obtained, and the online analysis software String was used to conduct enrichment analysis of their biological functions and signal pathways. Protein-protein interaction network, transcription factor-gene interaction network, miRNA-gene interaction network and environmental chemical-gene interaction network were established, and Cytoscape 3.72 was used to perform visualization. RESULTS: After data standardization, the data quality was excellent and it can ensure reliable results. Myocardial cell infection with SARS-CoV-2 and gene expression spectrum were changed significantly, including a total of 484 DEGs in adult cardiomyoblasts, a total of 667 DEGs in macrophages, and a total of 1 483 DEGs in human embryo source of cardiomyopathy.

The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is beginning to be elucidated but the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, remains incompletely understood. They play a role in the pathophysiology of viral infections with potential use as biomarkers. The objective of this study was to identify miRNAs as biomarkers of severe COVID-19 and to analyze their role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods miRNA expression was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients with severe COVID-19, 21 patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 20 controls. Promising miRNAs to differentiate non-severe from severe COVID-19 patients were identified by differential expression analysis and sparse Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA). ROC analysis, target prediction, GO enrichment and pathway analysis were used to analyze the role and the pertinence of these miRNAs in severe COVID-19. Results The number of expressed miRNAs was lower in severe COVID-19 patients compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients and controls. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs between severe COVID-19 and controls, 5 miRNAs were also differentially expressed between severe and non-severe COVID-19. sPLS-DA analysis highlighted 8 miRNAs, that allowed to discriminate the severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. Target and functional analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in viral infections and the cellular response to infection as well as one miRNA, hsa-miR-15b-5p, that targeted the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The comparison of results of differential expression analysis and discriminant analysis revealed three miRNAs, namely hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-491-5p and hsa-miR-200b-3p. These discriminated severe from non-severe cases with areas under the curve ranging from 0.76 to 0.80. Conclusions Our analysis of miRNA expression in nasopharyngeal swabs revealed several miRNAs of interest to discriminate severe and non-severe COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 1054 singleton live fetuses in breech presentation at Trondheim University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. The main outcome was intrapartum cesarean section, and secondary outcomes were postpartum hemorrhage, anal sphincter ruptures, Apgar scores, pH in the umbilical artery and metabolic acidosis. All data were obtained from the hospital birth journal. RESULTS: Induction of labor was performed in 127/606 (21.0%) of women with planned vaginal birth. The frequency of intrapartum cesarean section was 48.0% for induced labor vs 45.7% for spontaneous labor (p=0.64). We found no differences in the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage or anal sphincter ruptures between induced and spontaneous births. The median pH in the umbilical artery was significantly lower in neonates with induced labor compared with neonates with spontaneous labor (7.22 vs 7.25; p=0.02). The frequency of pH <7.05 was 7.0% for induced labor vs 2.9% (p= 0.05) for spontaneous labor, but the frequency of pH <7.0 was not significantly different: 2.6% vs 0.8% (p=0.14), respectively. Three neonates with planned vaginal birth had metabolic acidosis: two with spontaneous labors and one with induced labor. Three fetuses with planned vaginal birth died during labor: two with spontaneous onset of labor and one with induced labor. All three were extremely preterm: two were delivered in week 23 and one in week 25. We did not observe any significant trend in induction rates in either parous or in nulliparous women.

While some patients may experience mild or asymptomatic infection, others will progress to respiratory failure and death. Although some clinical parameters have been shown to predict patient outcomes, the role of cytokine measurements is controversial. The aim of the study was to determine whether admission cytokine levels can predict the clinical course of patients with COVID19. Methods: Blood was collected at admission from 41 patients with COVID19 at Virginia Commonwealth University from April-July 2020. A panel of 27 pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured in serum by multiplex assay. 20 patients were selected for analysis;10 with moderate disease (hospital admission, &lt;4L O2 need) and 10 severe COVID patients (ICU admission);patients with active malignancy were excluded. Multivariate principal component and correlation analysis (PCA) was performed. Patient severity (ICU admission, max O2 requirement, duration of hospital stay), patient demographics (gender, race, BMI), and serum cytokine levels were analyzed. Results: The only significant correlation with disease severity was duration of stay with TNF- (0.5772,p=0.0097, Fig. 1A). IL-6 was not correlated with severity. PCA clustered severe patients together, with more variability being observed in the moderate cases (Fig.1B). Disease severity parameters cluster together with limited association with the cytokine and demographics parameters (Fig.1C). PCA identified 2 main clusters of cytokines, but neither was associated with severity. TNF- and IL-8 were separate from the other cytokines (Fig.1C). Discussion: In this small series of COVID19 patients from an urban academic medical center, PCA revealed correlation between admission TNF- levels and the development of severe COVID19. No correlation was noted between admission IL-6 levels and disease severity. An association between TNF- and outcomes has recently been described in a large cohort from the United States, but we were not able to determine other predictors of outcomes despite an extensive cytokine panel. The discrepancy with prior studies may be attributed to the high percentage of African-American subjects and high rates of comorbidities in our cohort. Our findings show low levels of key cytokines when compared to previous studies in non-COVID ARDS suggesting a difference in the pathophysiology of severe COVID19. The lack of IL-6 association with severe COVID19 is consistent with recent negative trials of IL-6 blockade in COVID19.

As such, the interdisciplinary team in our Palliative and Supportive Care Unit strives to provide quality care sensitive to the physical and psychosocial needs of patients. Involving and allowing for the presence of family members is one way in which we afford our patients some additional comfort. Unfortunately, the current pandemic has placed limitations on this rather fundamental need for both patients and their family members. Here, we present a case illustrating the effects of visitor restrictions/isolation due to COVID-19 on the suffering of a patient at the EOL. CASE DESCRIPTION A male in his 20s with a refractory hematologic malignancy decided to pursue a comfort-based approach to care after a rapid clinical deterioration. Due to visitor restrictions, he had to face this decision with limited support at the bedside, which caused significant distress. He was forced to choose among several immediate family members who would be at his side through his hospitalization, to be his advocate, at times his voice, his confidant, and the person to relay all information to those on the outside. He expressed a wish to be married before he died, which occurred in our palliative care unit. This life goal was one we would normally encourage those he loved to gather around him, but this was not possible. He passed peacefully two days after he was married. CONCLUSION Although social limitations are necessary to help provide safety to the patients and staff in a hospital, they can have a direct impact on the suffering of patients and families at the EOL. Helping to maintain dignity, reflect on their life, and resolve any conflicts in the presence of family members is a benchmark for providing quality palliative care. Being barred from visitation due to isolation, threatens this care and lays the foundation for complicated grief among family members. Further research is needed to help balance the needs of those at the EOL with public safety. One such measure to help ease distress is to allow for more virtual visitation through electronic measures.","output":"Social isolation at the end of life: A case report of one person's journey navigating the medical landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of rapid testing offers an opportunity to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, the impact of false-positive and false-negative test results and population response must be anticipated and taken into consideration to avoid or mitigate harm.

We suggest using a risk-stratified testing strategy, based on targeted testing directly integrated with the Public Health Service's case and contact tracing management. According to the proposed targeted testing strategy stratified by risk of infection, all persons with acute symptoms of a respiratory infection as well as other population groups with an elevated probability of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be specifically tested to identify \\"hidden\\" infection networks. The strategy should include a uniform communication strategy for dealing with positive and negative test results, a targeted expansion of access to low-threshold testing opportunities, ensuring timely and free access to the results of confirmatory tests, and integration into an overarching documentation system for evaluation.

However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak.

By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease. We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague. Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer. SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force. We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.","output":"Disease metaphors in new epidemics: the UK media framing of the 2003 SARS epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread from China to the world, was declared a global public health emergency, which causes lethal respiratory infections. Acetylation of several proteins plays essential roles in various biological processes, such as viral infections. We reported that the nucleoproteins of influenza virus and Zaire Ebolavirus were acetylated, suggesting that these modifications contributed to the molecular events involved in viral replication. Similar to influenza virus and Ebolavirus, the coronavirus also contains single-stranded RNA, as its viral genome interacts with the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In this study, we report that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins are strongly acetylated by human histone acetyltransferases, P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), but not by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses identified 2 and 12 acetyl-lysine residues from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, respectively. Particularly in the SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, the acetyl-lysine residues were localized in or close to several functional sites, such as the RNA interaction domains and the M-protein interacting site. These results suggest that acetylation of SARS-CoV-2 N proteins plays crucial roles in their functions.","output":"In-vitro acetylation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins by human PCAF and GCN5"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study intends to present the key challenges in attending the online classes faced by the students Challenges have been categorized by different aspects In conducting the study primary data have been collected by using a well-tailored online questionnaire Total 508 responded to the online survey where snowball sampling technique was adopted SPSS software and simple cross-tabulation were used to analyze the collected data The study found that although highest percentage of students are attending the online class from metropolitan city or divisional city, 30 7% are attending from village area which is a dominating portion of the students 68 9% respondents are using mobile data which is not cost effective for them The study also resulted that network and facility related challenges, student-teacher interaction related challenges and personal & socio-psychological challenges are the prioritized challenges complained by the students Considering the results the study recommended some suggestions that might help for the policymakers to eliminate the challenges of online classes in the future Regulatory bodies like UGC, government, individual universities and other concerned authorities have many roles to play","output":"Assessing the Challenges in Online Class during the Coronavirus (covid-19) Pandemic in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical case scheduling is a key issue in the field of medician, which is a challenging work because of the difficulty in assigning resources to patients.

In this paper, we demonstrated that A3G interacted with the HBV core protein (HBc) directly in co-transfected HepG2 cells using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. In addition, we further found that this interaction did not require other factors in vitro using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology on BIAcore 3000. While cellular RNA or viral RNA was added to A3G protein solution before flow through the BIAcore chip, the interaction was not affected.

Consecutive patients with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from blood samples between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 were included. For each case, three non-ESBL-producing controls matching for date of detection and bacterial species were identified. The main outcome measure was the ability to accurately predict infection with ESBL-PE by measures of discrimination and calibration.ResultsOverall, 376 patients (94 patients, 282 controls) were analysed. Performance measures for prediction of ESBL-PE infection of both prediction models indicate adequate measures of calibration, but poor discrimination (area under receiver-operating curve: 0.627 and 0.651). History of ESBL-PE colonisation or infection was the single most predictive independent risk factor for ESBL-PE infection with high specificity (97%), low sensitivity (34%) and balanced positive and negative predictive values (80% and 82%).ConclusionsApplying published prediction models to institutions these were not derived from, may result in substantial misclassification of patients considered as being at risk, potentially leading to wrong allocation of antibiotic treatment, negatively affecting patient outcomes and overall resistance rates in the long term.

Previous studies have revealed that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is frequently used for and can be potential beneficial for strengthening physical and mental resilience. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence and associations for use of CAM during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of women and men in Norway. Methods: Computer assisted telephone interviews using an adapted questionnaire (I-CAM-QN) were conducted with 1000 randomly selected Norwegians aged 16 and above using multistage sampling in April and May 2020 applying age and gender quotas for each area. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Pearson's Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Independent samples T-tests to identify group differences. Results: The study revealed that two thirds of the respondents (67%) had used CAM within the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular CAM modalities that did not involve a provider. Most used were CAM natural remedies and dietary supplement (57%), mainly vitamins and minerals (43%), but self-help practices like yoga and meditation were also widely used (24%). Women used these therapies significantly more than men (77% vs. 58%). Conclusions: In summary, it can be concluded that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not profoundly changed the overall need of Norwegian citizens to seek for care outside the conventional healthcare system, but rather has caused a shift in the type of CAM modalities used. It remains to be investigated whether this changed pattern is maintained during the whole period of the pandemic.

The disease seriously affects the patient's respiratory system. At present, the prognosis of the disease is poor and there is a lack of effective treatments. Therefore, it is urgent to explore its pathogenesis and treatment methods. METHOD: We downloaded a set of expression profile data from GSE75097 related to OSAS based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and selected the representative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the sample of the GSE75097 dataset. WGCNA was used to find genes related to OSAS and obtain coexpression modules. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were used to analyze genes from key modules. Finally, Cytoscape software was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and analyze the hub genes. RESULT: We obtained a total of 7565 DEGs. Through WGCNA, we got four coexpression modules and the modules most related to OSAS were green-yellow, magenta, purple, and turquoise, and we screened out eight hub genes (DDX46, RNF115, COPA, FBXO4, PA2G4, NHP2L1, CDC20, and PCNA). GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the key modules were mainly enriched in tRNA modification, nucleobase metabolic process, DNA ligation, regulation of cellular component movement, basal transcription factors, Huntington disease, and vitamin digestion and absorption. CONCLUSION: These pathways and hub genes can facilitate understanding the molecular mechanism of OSAS and provide a meaningful reference for finding biological targets of OSAS treatment.","output":"Identifying Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome-Associated Genes and Pathways through Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the lack of approved drugs against acute viral diseases.

The objective of this study was to examine the degree of market integration of nine regional wholesale vegetable markets with DDEC in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairwise comparisons between vegetable prices at DDEC and regional markets were done using Engle- Granger Co-integration test to achieve this objective. The analysis was carried out in the first differenced form, which conformed to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests of stationarity. Short-run price disequilibrium was tested using Vector Auto-Regression Model (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Weekly wholesale prices of beans, carrot, tomato, and brinjal markets during 2018-2021 were used for the analysis.

The study took place in 8 hospitals in Jordan. A self-reported questionnaire and an observational checklist were developed based on the CDC (2007) isolation precautions guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 247 questionnaires were returned out of 400, for a response rate of 61.7%. The results show that most nurses (90%) have good knowledge of isolation precautions. However, only 65% of nurses reported good compliance with isolation precautions. The results of a t test revealed that nurses with Bachelor's degrees perform better in knowledge examinations than nurses with 2-year diplomas (P < .001). However, there was no significant difference in knowledge and self-report practices scores based on nurses' previous training and existence of isolation guidelines in their units or wards (P > .05). The results of the checklists confirm that there is a low compliance with standard isolation practice. In addition, the checklist shows that a high percentage of units and wards do not use isolation signs (46.4%) and posters (34.5%).

Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1C7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased. Not surprisingly, current therapeutic strategies for ACE2 involve augmenting its expression using ACE2 adenoviruses, recombinant ACE2 or compounds in these diseases thereby affording some organ protection.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Is a Key Modulator of the Renin Angiotensin System in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We sought to explore patient and carer experiences of psychosocial assessments following presentations to hospital after self-harm.

SETTING: Between March and November 2019, we recruited 88 patients (82% women) and 14 carers aged &#8805;18 years from 16 English mental health trusts, community organisations, and via social media. RESULTS: Psychosocial assessments were experienced as helpful on some occasions but harmful on others. Participants felt better, less suicidal and less likely to repeat self-harm after good-quality compassionate and supportive assessments. However, negative experiences during the assessment pathway were common and, in some cases, contributed to greater distress, less engagement and further self-harm. Participants reported receiving negative and stigmatising comments about their injuries. Others reported that they were refused medical care or an anaesthetic. Stigmatising attitudes among some mental health staff centred on preconceived ideas over self-harm as a 'behavioural issue', inappropriate use of services and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight important patient experiences that can inform service provision and they demonstrate the value of involving patients/carers throughout the research process. Psychosocial assessments can be beneficial when empathetic and collaborative but less helpful when overly standardised, lacking in compassion and waiting times are unduly long.

The findings were reported in medians and quartiles. Results A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most frequently diagnosed infections in the included studies. The overall median prevalence of appropriate ceftriaxone use is 39.2% (IQR: 29.9-60.9), showing that most of the included studies reported a higher prevalence of inappropriate ceftriaxone use. Although there are a higher number of patients with inappropriate use of ceftriaxone, a relatively higher number of patients got appropriate daily dose (79.8%, IQR: 45.7-89.4) of ceftriaxone than appropriate duration of ceftriaxone (55%, IQR: 52.2-80). Conclusion The review revealed that three in five patients with ceftriaxone got inappropriate ceftriaxone's dose, frequency or duration. A relatively higher number of patients got appropriate daily dose of ceftriaxone. On the other hand, approximately more than half of the patients got inappropriate duration, too short or too long, of ceftriaxone. Hence, prescribers are recommended to adhere to their country-specific treatment guideline. Moreover, it is highly recommended to either commence or strengthen antimicrobial stewardship program effectively in their healthcare settings.","output":"Appropriate Use of Ceftriaxone in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The typical indication of radon therapy is rheumatoid arthritis. Although there are several reports that radon therapy has regulation effects on Th17 cells, there has been no study reporting that radon inhalation affects the immune balance among Th1, Th2, and Th17. The purpose of this study is to examine the cytokine changes after radon inhalation. BALB/c mice inhaled radon at 2,000 Bq/m(3) for 2 or 4 weeks. SKG/Jcl mice inhaled radon at 2,000 Bq/m(3) for 4 weeks after zymosan administration. The results showed that radon inhalation for 4 weeks activated the immune response of Th1, Th2, and Th17. Moreover, the balance among them was not lost by radon inhalation. Radon inhalation for 4 weeks decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased catalase activity in spleen. These findings suggest that an imbalance of oxidative stress may contribute to activate the immune response. Although zymosan administration activated Th17 immune response and decreased Th1 and Th2 immune response in SKG/Jcl mice, most cytokines related to Th1, Th2, and Th17 approached the normal level by radon inhalation. These findings suggested that radon inhalation has a different action between SKG/Jcl mice and normal BABL/c mice. This may indicate that radon inhalation has an immunomodulation function.","output":"Mechanisms of action of radon therapy on cytokine levels in normal mice and rheumatoid arthritis mouse model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cardinal pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a primary infection of pulmonary tract cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, provoking a local inflammatory response, often accompanied by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome, especially in patients with severe disease.

We analyse eight of such methods and show that all of them yield high polarization scores even for random networks with similar density and degree distributions to typical real-world networks. Further, some of the methods are sensitive to degree distributions and relative sizes of the polarized groups. We propose normalization to the existing scores and a minimal set of tests that a score should pass in order for it to be suitable for separating polarized networks from random noise. The performance of the scores increased by 38%-220% after normalization in a classification task of 203 networks. Further, we find that the choice of method is not as important as normalization, after which most of the methods have better performance than the best-performing method before normalization.

The PV system has been designed, keeping in view the required electrical load and energy available from the sun in Jordan. The actual energy consumption of the hotel is estimated (444 MWh/year) for the design and simulation of the on-grid PV system using Photovoltaic Geographical Information System software (PVGIS) and photovoltaic software (PVsyst). The results showed that PV system required 912 panels distributed over 12 inverters, with a required area of 1757.3 m(2). In addition, the on-grid PV system produced a total yearly energy of 541 MWh, with an average performance ratio of 0.828. The economic study for the proposed PV system showed that the systems payback period was 4.1 year. Moreover, life cycle savings (LCS) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) analysis have been carried out. The LCS and LCOE of the system were found to be $51,493 and $0.0199 /kWh, respectively. Therefore, installing a proposed on-grid PV system on the Cedars hotel will save $38,718/year.

To do so, the only method that guarantees the continuity of classes is using information and communication technologies. The transition in the foreground points to the use of technological platforms that allow interaction and the development of classes through synchronous sessions. In this way, it has been possible to continue developing both administrative and academic activities. However, in effective education, there are factors that create an ideal environment where the generation of knowledge is possible. By moving from traditional educational models to remote models, this environment has been disrupted, significantly affecting student learning.

We analyzed the mutations, mutation frequency and count trends over time, and genomes trends over time from January through September. We show that certain mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not occurring randomly as it has been commonly believed. This finding is in agreement with other recently published research in this domain. Therefore, this validates other findings in this direction.

The primary objective of this study was to identify the rates and predicting factors of unplanned 30-day readmissions at a community-based hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a single-center community-based hospital administrative and clinical records identifying unplanned readmissions. Risk factors for readmissions due to surgical site infections, pain, medical vs. procedure-related complications, and the number of readmissions were studied using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total overall readmission rate was 7.3 % (79 readmissions for 1077 patients). The readmission rates for thoracolumbar and cervical surgeries were 5.5 % and 1.8 %, respectively. The mean duration to primary readmission was 11.4 + 8.5 days. The most common procedure-related complication diagnosed at readmittance was wound-related complications (26 readmissions, 32.9 %). The most common non-surgical complication was a drug reaction or overdose (10.1 %). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that longer hospitalization was a highly significant predictor of wound-related complications, followed by discharge to home or home care, and lower ASA scores (all <0.048). A younger age predicted readmissions due to pain (p = 0.014) and longer OR time did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.079). Higher ASA scores predicted readmissions due to medical vs. surgical complications (p = 0.028). There were no statistically significant predictors identified for more than one readmission during the 30-day post-discharge period. CONCLUSIONS The overall rate of 30-day unplanned readmissions at a community-based hospital was 7.3 % for patients undergoing spinal surgeries and was similar to the rates reported by larger academic tertiary care institutions and registry-based studies. The study suggests that surgical site infections was the most common reason for readmissions, which was predictive by longer hospitalization, discharge disposition, and lower ASA scores.","output":"Unplanned 30-Day readmission rates after spine surgery in a community-based Hospital setting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS This study aimed to describe the study design and respondent characteristics (including non-response analyses) of the Danish Health and Wellbeing Surveys in 2015 and 2019 and a follow-up survey that was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHODS The Danish Health and Wellbeing Survey is the Danish part of the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS). The samples in 2015 (N=12,000) and 2019 (N=14,000) were both based on a simple random selection of individuals aged ?15 years from the Danish Civil Registration System. All individuals from the sample in 2019 who were still alive and living in Denmark were reinvited for a follow-up survey in 2020 (N=13,474). Data in all surveys were collected via self-administered questionnaires (web or paper based). The questionnaires in 2015 and 2019 included the EHIS model questionnaire as well as national questions, whereas the questionnaire in 2020 mainly focused on physical and mental health, employment and working lives, and health behaviour.

In critically ill patients with the disease, common symptoms include sepsis, severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and complications such as coagulopathy and thrombosis. Many patients with COVID-19 have sequelae such as venous thromboembolism (VTE) including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as arterial thromboembolism (ATE) including stroke. COVID-19 induced inflammation can induce a prothrombotic state by activating the coagulation cascade; coupled with the immobility of severe and critically ill patients in ICU, making thrombosis common in this patient population. Different blood types in patients include A, B, AB, and O. ABO carbohydrate moieties are genetically inherited and have been linked to predisposing patients to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and even susceptibility of COVID-19. Blood type positivity and negativity are determined by the Rhesus (Rh) factor, which is a protein found on the surface of red blood cells and is also genetically inherited and linked to higher incidence of certain diseases such as diabetes. Studies have shown a relationship between blood types and increased severity of infection from COVID-19 including increased risk of thrombosis. Blood type A has been shown to have higher severity of disease with O blood type having a lower risk of infection or mortality. This study was done to evaluate if patients with different blood types have increased risk for thrombosis or higher mortality rates with COVID-19 infection. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020 and June 26, 2020 at our institution with reported blood typing. Patients who had a thromboembolism (VTE, DVT, PE, ATE, or stroke) verified by imaging were extracted from this cohort and included in the analysis. The prevalence of different blood types in COVID-19 patients was compared to the general population without COVID-19. The incidence of thrombosis and mortality rate based on blood type was analyzed to understand severity of COVID-19 disease. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-squared testing. Results Among 1265 COVID-19 positive patients during our time frame, 138 patients were identified to have a thrombosis. Of those, 102 patients with thrombosis and 402 without thrombosis had reported blood types that were used for analysis. There was no significant difference in prevalence of blood types in COVID-19 patients (A 34.3%, AB 2.9%, B 16.7%, O 46.1%) to the general nonCOVID-19 population (A32.7%, AB 4.2%, B 14.9%, O 48.1%) (p=0.8572). There was no significant difference in incidence of thrombosis between blood types: A (23.3%), AB (15%), B (20.7%), and O (18.7%) (p=0.6513). When stratifying by Rh factor, there was also no significant difference in incidence of thrombosis by blood types: A- (11.1%), A+ (24.1%), AB- (0%), AB+ (15.8%), B- (25%), B+ (20.3%), O- (18.2%), O+ (18.7%) (p=0.9054). There was also no significant difference in mortality rate between COVID-19 patients based on blood types in our cohort: A (20.7%), AB (15%), B (13.4%), and O (21.8%) (p=0.3747). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that there is no increased prevalence of one blood type over another between COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, showing that patients are not at higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on blood type. There was also no difference between blood types based on incidence of thrombosis. When further stratifying with Rh factor, there was also no difference in incidence of thrombosis based on blood types. This shows that regardless of Rh positivity or negativity, there is no increased risk for thrombosis in COVID-19 patients based on blood type. There is also no difference in mortality in COVID-19 patients based on blood type. Since COVID-19 patients who are critically ill and have more severe disease have higher incidence of thrombosis and higher mortality rates, our study suggests that patients are not at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease based on blood type. However, this study is also limited due to small sample size, and prospective studies are needed to better understand the relationship between blood type and severity of disease in COVID-19+ patients.

The mechanisms of action of CP include neutralizing antibodies but may extend beyond virus neutralization to include normalization of blood clotting and dampening of inflammation. Unresolved questions include the minimum therapeutic titer in the CP units or CP recipient as well as the optimal timing of administration. Here, we show that treatment of macaques with CP within 24 h of infection does not reduce viral shedding in nasal or lung secretions compared to controls and does not detectably improve any clinical endpoint. We also demonstrate that CP administration does not impact viral sequence diversity in vivo, although the selection of a viral sequence variant in both macaques receiving normal human plasma was suggestive of immune pressure. Our results suggest that CP, administered to medium titers, has limited efficacy, even when given very early after infection.

The purpose of abroad electives is to provide medical students with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of education and healthcare in an international context. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has substantially changed the international elective landscape. Travel restrictions, closures of international elective programs and the expansion of virtual methods for education caused a widespread disruption to abroad electives. A comprehensive analysis with regard to other consequences for abroad electives, however, has not been done before. Thus, we sought to a) summarize the current transformation of the international medical elective and b) to address potential challenges for post-pandemic international medical electives. METHODS: The methodology employed is a multidisciplinary narrative review of the published and grey literature on international electives during the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Students worldwide had electives postponed or canceled. Apart from evident immediate pandemic-related consequences (such as the substantial decline in global electives and impaired elective research opportunities for educators), there are other several problems that have received little attention during the last two years. These include challenges in the elective application process, poorly-understood consequences for host institutions, and growing global (ethical) disparities that are likely to increase once elective programs will gradually re-open. There is ample evidence that the post-pandemic elective landscape will be characterized by increasing elective fees, and a more competitive seat-to-applicant ratio. Ethical problems for international electives arising from an unequal global vaccine distribution will pose an additional challenge to students and elective coordinators alike. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the international medical elective landscape in an unprecedented way, and future generations of medical students will face a series of additional challenges when applying for global medical electives.","output":"International medical electives during and after the COVID-19 pandemic - current state and future scenarios: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak has created turmoil in domestic economies around the world.

This article will discuss the current literature on the CCC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and whether it is a therapeutic target in the context of various allergic, autoimmune or infectious diseases. Areas covered: Small-molecule inhibitors, chemokine and chemokine receptor-deficient mice, antibodies and modified chemokines are the current tools available for CCL5 research, and there are several ongoing clinical trials targeting the CCL5 receptors, CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. There are fewer studies specifically targeting the chemokine itself and clinical studies with anti-CCL5 antibodies are still to be carried out. Expert opinion: Although clinical trials are strongly biased toward HIV treatment and prevention with blockers of CCR5, the therapeutic potential for CCL5 and its receptors in other diseases is relevant. Overall, it is not likely that specific targeting of CCL5 will result in new adjunct strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases with a major inflammatory component. However, targeting CCL5 could result in novel therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, where it may decrease inflammatory responses and fibrosis, and certain solid tumors, where it may have a role in angiogenesis.","output":"Targeting CCL5 in inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BBIBP-CorV, especially measured the resistance of four global variants of concern: Lineage B.1.1.7, Lineage B.1.351, Lineage P.1, and Lineage B.1.526 to neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited sera.

We found that numerous mouse-passaged FV isolates also contained LDV and that coinfection with LDV delayed FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during acute infection. While LDV did not alter the type of acute pathology induced by FV, which was severe splenomegaly caused by erythroproliferation, the immunosuppression mediated by LDV increased both the severity and the duration of FV infection. Compared to mice infected with FV alone, those coinfected with both FV and LDV had delayed CD8(+) T-cell responses, as measured by FV-specific tetramers. This delayed response accounted for the prolonged and exacerbated acute phase of FV infection. Suppression of FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses occurred not only in mice infected concomitantly with LDV but also in mice chronically infected with LDV 8 weeks prior to infection with FV. The LDV-induced suppression was not mediated by T regulatory cells, and no inhibition of the CD4(+) T-cell or antibody responses was observed. Considering that most human adults are carriers of chronically infectious viruses at the time of new virus insults and that coinfections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus are currently epidemic, it is of great interest to determine how infection with one virus may impact host responses to a second infection.

This study assesses the behaviour of a new composite mesh by comparing it with two latest-generation composites currently used in clinical practice. METHODS Defects (7x5cm) created in the anterior abdominal wall of New Zealand White rabbits were repaired using a polypropylene mesh and the composites: Physiomesh(TM); Ventralight(TM) and a new composite mesh with a three-dimensional macroporous polyester structure and an oxidized collagen/chitosan barrier. Animals were sacrificed on days 14 and 90 postimplant. Specimens were processed to determine host tissue incorporation, gene/protein expression of neo-collagens (RT-PCR/immunofluorescence), macrophage response (RAM-11-immunolabelling) and biomechanical resistance. On postoperative days 7/14, each animal was examined laparoscopically to quantify adhesions between the visceral peritoneum and implant. RESULTS The new composite mesh showed the lowest incidence of seroma in the short term. At each time point, the mesh surface covered with adhesions was greater in controls than composites. By day 14, the implants were fully infiltrated by a loose connective tissue that became denser over time. At 90 days, the peritoneal mesh surface was lined with a stable mesothelium. The new composite mesh induced more rapid tissue maturation than Physiomesh(TM), giving rise to a neoformed tissue containing more type I collagen. In Ventralight(TM) the macrophage reaction was intense and significantly greater than the other composites at both follow-up times. Tensile strengths were similar for each biomaterial. CONCLUSIONS All composites showed optimal peritoneal behaviour, inducing good peritoneal regeneration and scarce postoperative adhesion formation. A greater foreign body reaction was observed for Ventralight(TM). All composites induced good collagen deposition accompanied by optimal tensile strength. The three-dimensional macroporous structure of the new composite mesh may promote rapid tissue regeneration within the mesh.","output":"Behaviour of a new composite mesh for the repair of full-thickness abdominal wall defects in a rabbit model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease-19 (nCoV-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and now involved the whole word.

Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justifications are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten\\\\day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more efficient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial.

Fifty-three AMI patients (31 STEMI, 22 NSTEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic were matched to 53 AMI patients before the pandemic. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the matched patients. STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer delay time, less primary or remedial PCI and more emergency thrombolysis than those before the pandemic. Less coronary angiography and stenting were performed in AMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the matched patients. However, STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had a 4-fold (12.9% vs. 3.2%) increase in all-cause mortality rate compared with those before the pandemic.

We have previously shown that percutaneous radiofrequency ablation guided by image-fusion technology allows for precise needle placement with real time ultrasound superimposed with pre-loaded imaging, removing the need for real-time CT or MR guidance. Emerging technology also allows real-time tracking of a treatment needle within an organ in a virtually created 3D format. To our knowledge, this is the first study utilising a sophisticated ultrasound-based navigation system that uses both image-fusion and real-time probe-tracking technologies for in-vivo renal ablative intervention. OBJECTIVES ? To evaluate the feasibility, accuracy and efficacy of ultrasonography (US)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the canine kidney model using novel Global Positioning System-like probe tracking technology. ? Virtual tumours in the canine kidney were ablated in vivo by percutaneous RFA guided exclusively by two-dimensional (2D) US and a virtual navigation system. MATERIALS AND METHODS ? Gold fiducial markers were inserted into renal parenchyma to serve as centres of virtual tumours. ? After capturing 2D US images, navigation software created a three-dimensional planning model of the kidney, and superimposed it onto the live US image. ? Percutaneous RFA was guided by multiplanar navigation, showing real-time probe positions within the superimposed images, to treat each virtual tumour with a single treatment. ? Navigator software predicted the percentage of tumour treated; treated kidney specimens were examined to evaluate projection and targeting accuracy. RESULTS ? In total, 32 virtual tumours (median diameter 16 mm, range 10-24 mm) were treated in 16 canine kidneys. ? Median (range) error between 'fiducial tumour centre' and 'treated area centre' was 1.8 (0-25) mm. ? Targeting accuracy improved with experience: median (range) error decreased from 6.3 (2-25) mm in an initial 12 tumours to 1.3 (0-9.0) mm in the last 20 tumours (P= 0.008). ?

RESULTS: The median age was 40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male. The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%). Diarrhea was not common (10.7%). Two patients had no symptoms. Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients. Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation. Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases. Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5-7 day period after symptom onset. Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT). CONCLUSION: The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity. Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase. Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR. These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.","output":"Clinical Course and Outcomes of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Preliminary Report of the First 28 Patients from the Korean Cohort Study on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Late 2019 a new coronavirus appeared, creating a pandemic, with the first case in Switzerland detected on the 25th of February 2020.

AIM: To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination. METHODS: During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutininCneuraminidase and fusion protein genes. FINDINGS: Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within <7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (7 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion. CONCLUSION: At least one-third of a peak season nosocomial hPIV-3 outbreak originated from nosocomial transmission, with multiple importations of hPIV-3 from the community, providing experimental evidence for extensive environmental hPIV-3 contamination. Direct contact with the contaminated surfaces and fomites or indirect transmission from infected healthcare workers could be responsible for nosocomial transmission.","output":"Molecular epidemiology and environmental contamination during an outbreak of parainfluenza virus 3 in a haematology ward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of an effective AIDS vaccine remains a challenge. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) have proved to be a potent mode of immunization against infectious diseases in preclinical studies, and are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 in humans. A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we show that mRNA-LNP immunization compared to protein immunization elicits either the same or superior magnitude and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP encoding Zika premembrane and envelope or HIV-1 Env gp160 induces durable neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 g are immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection.

The role of novel iron therapies to treat anaemia is increasing. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the efficacy and safety of iron therapies for the treatment of adults with anaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS Electronic databases and search engines were searched as per Cochrane methodology. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron vs. inactive control or placebo, as well as alternative formulations, doses, and routes in anaemic adults without chronic kidney disease or in the peri-partum period were eligible. The primary outcome of interest was mortality at 1 year. Secondary outcomes were blood transfusion, haemoglobin levels, quality of life, serious adverse events, and length of hospital stay. A total of 64 RCTs (including five studies of heart failure patients) comprising 9004 participants were included. None of the studies was at a low risk of bias. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality between iron and inactive control. Both oral and parenteral iron significantly reduced the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion compared with inactive control [risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.90; and RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97, respectively]. Haemoglobin was increased more by both oral and parenteral iron compared with inactive control [mean difference (MD) 0.91 g/dL, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; and MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57, respectively], and parenteral iron demonstrated a greater increase when compared with oral iron (MD 0.53 g/dL, 95% CI 0.31-0.75). In all comparisons, there were no differences in the results comparing patients with and without heart failure. CONCLUSION Both oral and parenteral iron are shown to decrease the proportion of people who require blood transfusion and increase haemoglobin levels, without any benefit on mortality.

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively.

However, the more often the environment is cleaned, the higher the risk of cleaning staff getting infected. Therefore, strong demand for sanitizing areas in automatic modes is undoubtedly expected. In this paper, an autonomous disinfection vehicle with an Ultraviolet-C (UVC) lamp is designed and implemented using an ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning sensor. The UVC dose for 90% inactivation of the reproductive ability of COVID-19 is 41.7 J/m(2), which a 40 W UVC lamp can achieve within a 1.6 m distance for an exposure time of 30 s. With this UVC lamp, the disinfection vehicle can effectively sterilize in various scenarios. In addition, the high-accuracy UWB positioning system, with the time difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm, is also studied for autonomous vehicle navigation in indoor environments. The number of UWB tags that use a synchronization protocol between UWB anchors can be unlimited. Moreover, this proposed Gradient Descent (GD), which uses Taylor method, is a high-efficient algorithm for finding the optimal position for real-time computation due to its low error and short calculating time. The generalized traversal path planning procedure, with the edge searching method, is presented to improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation. The average error of the practical navigation demonstrated in the meeting room is 0.10 m. The scalability of the designed system to different application scenarios is also discussed and experimentally demonstrated. Hence, the usefulness of the proposed UWB sensor applied to UVC disinfection vehicles to prevent COVID-19 infection is verified by employing it to sterilize indoor environments without human operation.","output":"Ultra-Wideband Positioning Sensor with Application to an Autonomous Ultraviolet-C Disinfection Vehicle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak.

A panel of experimental and FDA-approved compounds targeting calcium channels and PIKfyve at the endosomal membrane caused potent reductions of entry up to 90% in SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped retrovirus. Similar inhibition was observed against transduced EBOV glycoprotein pseudovirus and ASFV. SARS-CoV-2 infection was potently inhibited by selective estrogen receptor modulators in cells transduced with pseudovirus, among them Raloxifen inhibited ASFV with very low 50% inhibitory concentration.

We analyzed the relationship and pathways of perceived discriminations effect on health among the Chinese diaspora in the context of the pandemic to contribute to the literature on discrimination in this population under the global public health crisis. METHODS: We analyzed data from 705 individuals of Chinese descent residing in countries outside of China who participated in a cross-sectional online survey between April 22 and May 9, 2020. This study utilized a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of perceived discrimination on self-rated health (SRH) and to assess the mediating roles of psychological distress (namely, anxiety and depression) and social support from family and friends. RESULTS: This online sample comprised predominantly young adults and those of relatively high socioeconomic status. This study confirmed the total and direct effect of recently perceived discrimination on SRH and found the indirect effect was mainly mediated by depression. Mediating roles of anxiety and social support on the discrimination-health relationship were found insignificant in this SEM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest discrimination negatively affected the well-being of the Chinese diaspora, and depression acted as a major mediator between the discrimination-health relationship. Therefore, interventions for reducing discrimination to preserve the well-being of the Chinese diaspora are necessary.

Human tissue analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is urgently needed, and we here present autopsy data from 7 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 cases. The initial RT-qPCR analyses from nasopharyngeal swabs taken post mortem included typing assays for B.1.1.7. We quantitated SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 viral load in autopsy tissue of multiple organs. Highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 copies normalized to ?-globin were detected in the respiratory system (lung and pharynx), followed by the liver and heart. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was found in 100% of cases in the lungs and in 85.7% in pharynx tissue. Detection also in the kidney and brain highlighting a pronounced organ tropism. Comparison of the given results to a former cohort of SARS-CoV-2 deaths during the first wave in spring 2020 showed resembling organ tropism.

precedent for medicine, especially vulnerable immunocompromised patients Cancer patients are facing a dilemma, uncertain of their treatment course, and the serious risk of contracting the viral illness, all while there is no current research showing mortality rates in this group We present a rapidly evolving undiagnosed COVID-19 patient after chemotherapy initiation for a recent lung cancer diagnosis CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian male with a history of COPD, tobacco use and a recent diagnosis of lung cancer presented to the emergency department after experiencing palpitations and 10 days of malaise and dyspnea on exertion Prior to this, he underwent lung cancer screening with a CT chest scan on April 19, 2020 (baseline CT chest, Figure 1) The results showed a left lower lobe mass without infiltrates, subsequently biopsied and confirmed small cell lung carcinoma Upon presentation to our hospital on May 1, 2020, our patients labs were significant for C absolute lymphocyte count (745), D-dimer (4 33), NT-proBNP (2149), troponin (0 05), ALT (97), AST (87), creatinine (1 39) There was no evidence of an elevated total WBC, abnormal thyroid studies or any labs suggestive of paraneoplastic syndrome His initial ECG showed atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular rate CT chest showed honeycombing lesions in the central right lobe and around the left lobe near the lung mass (Figure 2) Given the patients hemodynamic instability, the patient was admitted to the ICU and successfully cardioverted following a negative TEE A respiratory PCR panel returned negative on May 4 (did not include COVID-19) Chemotherapy was initiated with carboplatin, etoposide and dexamethasone A follow-up CT chest revealed evolution of the honeycombing lesions, now spread diffusely, raising concern for COVID-19 (Figure 3) A COVID-19 NAAT returned positive on May 6 DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the increased susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 Given this, we recommend pre-emptive COVID-19 testing for all patients prior to starting any chemotherapy Secondly, this serves as an example of the rapid evolution of COVID-19, and the benefits of repeated imaging CONCLUSIONS: Prior reports from Chinese patients showed bilateral infiltrates upon admission 79% of the time and median 5 days of symptom onset to admission (Zhao1) CT chest scans typically showed ground glass opacities and bilateral patchy shadowing (Guan2, Shi3) If testing is not readily available or turn-around time is prolonged, repeat CT chest scans can help guide treatment Having a baseline CT chest helped initiate testing for COVID-19 after his symptoms worsened once he received chemotherapy The evolution is rapid, requiring a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and extensive testing to monitor the course in these patients This case hopes to set a standard for similar patients Reference #1: Zhao D, Yao F, Wang L, et al A comparative study on the clinical features of

The high transmission risk and mortality rates of COVID-19 cause serious concerns in ophthalmologists and may cause disruptions in clinical functioning. This study aims to identify changes in the clinical approaches of ophthalmologists, understand their anxiety levels, and exhibit how patients' follow-up processes progress during the pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire that including demographic information, ophthalmology clinical activity scale, and Beck anxiety scale was sent to ophthalmologists in Turkey. Google Forms was used as a survey platform in this study. RESULTS: A total of 121 ophthalmologists participated in the study. The participants stated that they could not continue routine interventional diagnosis and treatment practices during the outbreak. It was clearly stated that there were changes in their clinical approach and decreased patient examination quality. For this reason, 14.9% of physicians said to missed the diagnosis in this process. Physicians who encounter infected patients state that it is more difficult to provide ophthalmological services and their clinical approaches are affected more negatively. Anxiety levels of physicians who could access personal protective equipment (PPE) and show positive solidarity with their colleagues in the process were found to be lower. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that ophthalmologists, like other healthcare professionals, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, healthcare managers should provide adequate PPE for ophthalmologists, organize the clinical operation, and support the mental health of ophthalmologists.","output":"The evolution of the changes in the clinical course: a multicenter survey-related impression of the ophthalmologists at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In accordance with the Statutes of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the final stage in the process of making changes to the Universal Scheme of Virus Classification is the ratification of taxonomic proposals by ICTV Members.

A deep learning approach can differentiate between habitual smoking versus nonsmoking environments, suggesting that it may be possible to predict environment-associated smoking risk from continuously acquired images of smokers daily environments. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to predict environment-associated risk from continuously acquired images of smokers daily environments. We also aim to understand how model performance varies by location type, as reported by participants. METHODS: Smokers from Durham, North Carolina and surrounding areas completed ecological momentary assessments both immediately after smoking and at randomly selected times throughout the day for 2 weeks. At each assessment, participants took a picture of their current environment and completed a questionnaire on smoking, craving, and the environmental setting. A convolutional neural networkCbased model was trained to predict smoking, craving, whether smoking was permitted in the current environment and whether the participant was outside based on images of participants daily environments, the time since their last cigarette, and baseline data on daily smoking habits. Prediction performance, quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and average precision (AP), was assessed for out-of-sample prediction as well as personalized models trained on images from days 1 to 10. The models were optimized for mobile devices and implemented as a smartphone app. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants completed the study, and 8008 images were acquired. The personalized models were highly effective in predicting smoking risk (AUC=0.827; AP=0.882), craving (AUC=0.837; AP=0.798), whether smoking was permitted in the current environment (AUC=0.932; AP=0.981), and whether the participant was outside (AUC=0.977; AP=0.956). The out-of-sample models were also effective in predicting smoking risk (AUC=0.723; AP=0.785), whether smoking was permitted in the current environment (AUC=0.815; AP=0.937), and whether the participant was outside (AUC=0.949; AP=0.922); however, they were not effective in predicting craving (AUC=0.522; AP=0.427). Omitting image features reduced AUC by over 0.1 when predicting all outcomes except craving. Prediction of smoking was more effective for participants whose self-reported location type was more variable (Spearman =0.48; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Images of daily environments can be used to effectively predict smoking risk. Model personalization, achieved by incorporating information about daily smoking habits and training on participant-specific images, further improves prediction performance. Environment-associated smoking risk can be assessed in real time on a mobile device and can be incorporated into device-based smoking cessation interventions.","output":"Prediction of Smoking Risk From Repeated Sampling of Environmental Images: Model Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.","output":"Phytochemicals from Plant Foods as Potential Source of Antiviral Agents: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected African countries, specifically the countries, such as Libya, that are in constant conflict. Clinical and laboratory information, including mortality and associated risk factors in relation to hospital settings and available resources, about critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Africa is not available. This study aimed to determine the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) following 60 days after ICU admission, and explore the factors that influence in-ICU mortality rate. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study among COVID-19 critical care patients in 11 ICUs in Libya from May 29th to December 30th 2020. Basic demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory values, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, quick SOFA, and clinical management were analyzed. RESULT: We included 465 consecutive COVID-19 critically ill patients. The majority (67.1%) of the patients were older than 60 years, with a median (IQR) age of 69 (56.5-75); 240 (51.6%) were male. At 60 days of follow-up, 184 (39.6%) were discharged alive, while 281 (60.4%) died in the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) ICU length of stay was 7 days (4-10) and non-survivors had significantly shorter stay, 6 (3-10) days. The body mass index was 27.9 (24.1-31.6) kg/m2. At admission to the intensive care unit, quick SOFA median (IQR) score was 1 (1-2), whereas total SOFA score was 6 (4-7). In univariate analysis, the following parameters were significantly associated with increased/decreased hazard of mortality: increased age, BMI, white cell count, neutrophils, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and d-dimer levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Decreased lymphocytes, and platelet count were associated with higher risk of mortality. Quick SOFA and total SOFA scores increase, emergency intubation, inotrope use, stress myocardiopathy, acute kidney injury, arrythmia, and seizure were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study reported the highest mortality rate (60.4%) among critically ill patients with COVID-19 60 days post-ICU admission. Several factors were found to be predictive of mortality, which may help to identify patients at risk of mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Epidemiology, outcomes, and utilization of intensive care unit resources for critically ill COVID-19 patients in Libya: A prospective multi-center cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the effect of population health on gross inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).

Methods: We used data for 363,651 individuals (2,178,835 observations) aged 18 years and over between 1st May 2020 and 31st January 2021 from the ONS Covid Infection Survey, a representative longitudinal survey of individuals in England. We focus on two measures of work; employment status for all adults, and work sector of individuals currently working. Multi-level binomial regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of testing positive of COVID-19, adjusting for known explanatory covariates. Results: 0.9% of participants tested positive for COVID-19 over the study period. COVID-19 prevalence was higher among adults who were students or furloughed (i.e., temporarily not working). Among adults currently working, COVID-19 prevalence was highest in adults employed in the hospitality sector, with higher prevalence for individuals employed in transport, social care, retail, health care and educational sectors. Inequalities by work were not consistent over time. Conclusions: We find an unequal distribution of infections relating to COVID-19 by work and employment status. Our findings demonstrate the need for greater workplace interventions to protect employees, but also that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs outside of work.

Although SARSCoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. To resolve these issues, we aim to summarize the prevalence and its underlying mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: The main clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is pneumonia, cardiovascular complications have also been identified in the earliest reported cases from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. Given the SARS-CoV-2 likely uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as its host receptor, ACE2-related signaling pathways may play a key role in mediating myocardial injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection related acute cardiac injury cannot be ignored, and its underlying mechanisms remain speculated.

We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of four COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection, hospitalisation, and death for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using national COVID-19 notification, hospitalisation, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we did a test-negative, case-control study to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac [Sinovac], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca], Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen], and BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech]) for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched cases with RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 with up to ten controls with negative RT-PCR tests who presented with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests done at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity and the odds of hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines. FINDINGS: Between Feb 24, 2020, and Nov 11, 2021, we identified 213 457 individuals who had a subsequent, symptomatic illness with RT-PCR testing done at least 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and after the vaccination programme started. Among these, 30 910 (145%) had a positive RT-PCR test consistent with reinfection, and we matched 22 566 of these cases with 145 055 negative RT-PCR tests from 68 426 individuals as controls. Among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 394% (95% CI 361C426) for CoronaVac, 560% (514C602) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 440% (315C542) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 648% (549C724) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose than after the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 813% (753C858) for CoronaVac, 899% (835C938) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 577% (?26 to 825) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 897% (543C977) for BNT162b2. INTERPRETATION: All four vaccines conferred additional protection against symptomatic infections and severe outcomes among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The provision of a full vaccine series to individuals after recovery from COVID-19 might reduce morbidity and mortality.

However, effectiveness varied within and between populations. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers require more than evidence of effect; they need guidance on how best to design and implement RPM interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to explore these results further to (1) identify factors of RPM interventions that relate to increased and decreased acute care use and (2) develop recommendations for future RPM interventions. DESIGN: Realist reviewa qualitative systematic review method which aims to identify and explain why intervention results vary in different situations. We analysed secondarily 91 studies included in our previous systematic review that reported on RPM interventions and the impact on acute care use. Online databases PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched in October 2020. Included studies were published in English during 2015C2020 and used RPM to monitor an individuals biometric data (eg, heart rate, blood pressure) from a distance. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Contextual factors and potential mechanisms that led to variation in acute care use (hospitalisations, length of stay or emergency department presentations). RESULTS: Across a range of RPM interventions 31 factors emerged that impact the effectiveness of RPM innovations on acute care use. These were synthesised into six theories of intervention success: (1) targeting populations at high risk; (2) accurately detecting a decline in health; (3) providing responsive and timely care; (4) personalising care; (5) enhancing self-management, and (6) ensuring collaborative and coordinated care. CONCLUSION: While RPM interventions are complex, if they are designed with patients, providers and the implementation setting in mind and incorporate the key variables identified within this review, it is more likely that they will be effective at reducing acute hospital events.

Transcriptome-wide mRNA expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed in five CAD patients and five controls. Functional enrichment analyses, proteinCprotein interaction network construction, and hub gene selection were further conducted. Relative expression levels of hub genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in larger cohorts. Spearman correlation test and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to examine the relationship between confounding factors with severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was adopted to identify potentially diagnostic biomarkers for CAD. A total of 527 upregulated and 653 downregulated mRNAs were identified as DEGs in CAD patients. The relative expression levels of beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC), F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4 (FBXL4), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 D2 (UBE2D2), and ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1 (ASB1) were significantly different between two groups (all p  0.05). The severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis was negatively associated with the BTRC gene relative expression level (r = ?0.323, p < 0.001) and positively with UBE2D2 (r = 0.285, p < 0.001).

In this study, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 P.1 sub-lineage circulating in Brazil, denoted here as Gamma-like-II, that as well as the previously described lineage Gamma-like-I shares several lineage-defining mutations with the VOC Gamma. Reconstructions of ancestor sequences support that most lineage-defining mutations of the Spike (S) protein, including those at the receptor-binding domain (RBD), accumulated at the first P.1 ancestor. In contrast, mutations outside the S protein were mostly fixed at subsequent steps. Our evolutionary analyses estimate that P.1-ancestral strains carrying RBD mutations of concern probably circulated cryptically in the Amazonas for several months before the emergence of the VOC Gamma. Unlike the VOC Gamma, the other P.1 sub-lineages displayed a much more restricted dissemination and accounted for a low fraction (<2 per cent) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Brazil in 2021. The stepwise diversification of lineage P.1 through multiple inter-host transmissions is consistent with the hypothesis that partial immunity acquired from natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in heavily affected regions might have been a major driving force behind the natural selection of some VOCs. The lag time between the emergence of the P.1 ancestor and the expansion of the VOC Gamma and the divergent epidemic trajectories of P.1 sub-lineages support a complex interplay between the emergence of mutations of concern and viral spread in Brazil.","output":"Identification of a novel SARS-CoV-2 P.1 sub-lineage in Brazil provides new insights about the mechanisms of emergence of variants of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Special features of the #COVID19 pandemic mean that the several aspects of the usual approach to research are not fit for purpose https://bit.ly/32JyZr9","output":"A new model for clinical trials to address the COVID-19 emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Intravenous therapy and medicines (IVTM) are the most common invasive interventions in use in healthcare.

We evaluated the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second European wave. Methods: Using SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November 2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore, we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening. Findings: When schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94).

Overall percent-score revealed that only 24.4% of participants had good knowledge about paracetamol and its related potential toxicities. 62.5% of participants considered paracetamol safer than other medications of the same indications. 42.6% of participants could advise others to use paracetamol without prescription. According to the participants' responses, physicians were less concerned to give instructions about possibility of overdosage. Our results also revealed that participants administration of paracetamol without physician prescription was more during COVID-19. Practice of paracetamol administration more than the allowed number of tablets/day was significantly more evident during the pandemic. We concluded that the unsupervised use of paracetamol is an alarming sign that should be addressed as this could lead to a high rate of accidental paracetamol toxicity. A lesson learnt from COVID-19 pandemic is the need to implement behavior change measures to mitigate the risk of accidental paracetamol toxicity.","output":"Egyptian Perspectives on Potential Risk of Paracetamol/Acetaminophen-induced Toxicities: Lessons Learnt during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have entered a new phase of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as the strategy of relying solely on the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to bring the pandemic to an end has become infeasible. In response, public-health authorities in many countries have advocated for a strategy of using the vaccines to limit morbidity and mortality while permitting unchecked SARS-CoV-2 spread (\\"learning to live with the disease\\"). The feasibility of this strategy is critically dependent on the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19. An expectation exists, both in the lay public and in the scientific community, that future waves of the virus will exhibit decreased IFR, either due to viral attenuation or the progressive buildup of immunity. In this work, we examine the basis for that expectation, assessing the impact of virulence on transmission. Our findings suggest that large increases in virulence for SARS-CoV-2 would result in minimal loss of transmission, implying that the IFR may be free to increase or decrease under neutral evolutionary drift. We further examine the effect of changes in the IFR on the steady-state death toll under conditions of endemic COVID-19. Our modeling suggests that endemic SARS-CoV-2 implies vast transmission resulting in yearly US COVID-19 death tolls numbering in the hundreds of thousands under many plausible scenarios, with even modest increases in the IFR leading to an unsustainable mortality burden. Our findings thus highlight the critical importance of enacting a concerted strategy (involving for example global access to vaccines, therapeutics, prophylactics and nonpharmaceutical interventions) to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes. Our findings also highlight the importance of continued investment in novel biomedical interventions to prevent viral transmission.","output":"Endemicity is not a victory: the unmitigated downside risks of widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The biggest concerns in the current pandemic are enormous workload pressure, psychological distress, caregiver burnout, and, even worse, transmission of the virus among healthcare workers. One of the potentially beneficial tools in reducing the above-mentioned risks for overwhelming the healthcare system is telemedicine. Although the role of telemedicine and related interventions as a crisis management tool has increased, the current state of the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties has not been adequately evaluated. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE: The objective of this review is to screen the literature, extract expert opinions, qualitative, and quantitative data on the current use and future directions in the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings would potentially help in understanding the challenges and future directions of telemedicine use in surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The databases to be searched include PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (via Ovid). In addition, ClinicalTrials.gov and medRxiv.org will be searched for any ongoing and/or unpublished studies. The reference lists of articles included in the review will be screened to assess the sensitivity of the search. Literature search, quality assessment, followed by data extraction will be performed by two independent researchers. The findings of the data synthesis will be reported in diagrams, tables, and text. This review will consider reports that include expert opinions, qualitative and quantitative data on the implementation of telemedicine in surgery and surgical subspecialties (including patients with surgical disease of any age) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, future perspectives reported based either on the evidence provided by the data or on expert opinions will be considered. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not require an institutional review board approval given its summary design nature. Findings of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS 1175 people received SAFER over a 12-month period at 18 gun shows and community events in 2019 and completed a preassessment measuring firearms ownership, storage practices, knowledge about suicide as the leading type of firearm fatality and attitudes about suicide prevention. 372 responded to a brief postassessment using comparable measures. RESULTS 85% of participants reported keeping firearms at home. 43.7% reported current or prior military service. 53.2% were males between the ages of 35 and 64. Among those who responded to the postassessment, 61% of participants reported SAFER to be highly valuable. Safe firearms storage improved among participants who completed the preassessment and postassessment (51.2% pre, 66.0% post; p<0.01) as did safe medication storage (14.8% pre, 21.6% post; p=0.01). Knowledge that most firearm fatalities are suicides (33.4% pre, 45.8% post; p<0.01) also improved.

These advances inevitably hold the promise to improve personal and population well-being and welfare substantially. It is paradoxical that while greater access to biotechnology on a population level has many advantages, it may also increase the likelihood and frequency of biodisasters due to accidental or malicious use. Similar to Disease X (describing unknown naturally emerging pathogenic diseases with a pandemic potential), we term this unknown risk from biotechnologies Biodisaster X. To date, no studies have examined the potential role of information technologies in preventing and mitigating Biodisaster X. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore (1) what Biodisaster X might entail and (2) solutions that use artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging 6G technologies to help monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats. METHODS: A review of the literature on applying AI and 6G technologies for monitoring and managing biodisasters was conducted on PubMed, using articles published from database inception through to November 16, 2020. RESULTS: Our findings show that Biodisaster X has the potential to upend lives and livelihoods and destroy economies, essentially posing a looming risk for civilizations worldwide. To shed light on Biodisaster X threats, we detailed effective AI and 6G-enabled strategies, ranging from natural language processing to deep learningCbased image analysis to address issues ranging from early Biodisaster X detection (eg, identification of suspicious behaviors), remote design and development of pharmaceuticals (eg, treatment development), and public health interventions (eg, reactive shelter-at-home mandate enforcement), as well as disaster recovery (eg, sentiment analysis of social media posts to shed light on the publics feelings and readiness for recovery building). CONCLUSIONS: Biodisaster X is a looming but avoidable catastrophe. Considering the potential human and economic consequences Biodisaster X could cause, actions that can effectively monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats must be taken promptly and proactively. Rather than solely depending on overstretched professional attention of health experts and government officials, it is perhaps more cost-effective and practical to deploy technology-based solutions to prevent and control Biodisaster X threats. This study discusses what Biodisaster X could entail and emphasizes the importance of monitoring and managing Biodisaster X threats by AI techniques and 6G technologies. Future studies could explore how the convergence of AI and 6G systems may further advance the preparedness for high-impact, less likely events beyond Biodisaster X.","output":"Addressing Biodisaster X Threats With Artificial Intelligence and 6G Technologies: Literature Review and Critical Insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pregnancy. Methods: Databases (Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched electronically on 6th April and updated regularly until 8th June 2020. Reports of pregnant women with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 were included. Meta-analytical proportion summaries and meta-regression analyses for key clinical outcomes are provided. Findings: 86 studies were included, 17 studies (2567 pregnancies) in the quantitative synthesis; other small case series and case reports were used to extract rarely-reported events and outcome. Most women (73.9%) were in the third trimester; 52.4% have delivered, half by caesarean section (48.3%). The proportion of Black, Asian or minority ethnic group membership (50.8%); obesity (38.2%), and chronic co-morbidities (32.5%) were high. The most commonly reported clinical symptoms were fever (63.3%), cough (71.4%) and dyspnoea (34.4%). The commonest laboratory abnormalities were raised CRP or procalcitonin (54.0%), lymphopenia (34.2%) and elevated transaminases (16.0%). Preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was common (21.8%), usually medically-indicated (18.4%). Maternal intensive care unit admission was required in 7.0%, with intubation in 3.4%. Maternal mortality was uncommon (~1%). Maternal intensive care admission was higher in cohorts with higher rates of co-morbidities (beta=0.007, p<0.05) and maternal age over 35 years (beta=0.007, p<0.01). Maternal mortality was higher in cohorts with higher rates of antiviral drug use (beta=0.03, p<0.001), likely due to residual confounding. Neonatal nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR was positive in 1.4%. Interpretation: The risk of iatrogenic preterm birth and caesarean delivery was increased. The available evidence is reassuring, suggesting that maternal morbidity is similar to that of women of reproductive age.

Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure. Asymptomatic people were more prone to have negative antibody titters in the second run.","output":"COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police force, Southern Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advanced age is often associated with increased emotional well-being, with older adults reporting more positive and less negative affect than younger adults. Here, we test whether this pattern held during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that disproportionately put older adults at risk. We additionally examine potential moderating effects of daily activity and social connectedness, which have been shown to benefit mental health across the life span. We regularly assessed a large sample of adults ages 18-89 using online surveys. As preregistered for this report (https://osf.io/tb4qv), we focus on self-reported measures of affect, depression, stress, and worry as well as self-reported daily activity and perception of social isolation during two time windows for adults in the United States: early (mid-March to early April) and later (mid-April to early May) periods during the spring phase of the pandemic. Increased age benefited emotional well-being for multiple metrics during both time windows assessed. Furthermore, the results confirmed that exercise and perception of social connectedness can buffer against negative mental health outcomes across all ages, although the beneficial effects of age remained even when controlling for these influences. The one exception was worry about one's own health: Once exercise and social connectedness were controlled, increased age was associated with more worry. The results overall suggest that, at least among adults with access to technology, older age was associated with greater resilience during the spring phase of the pandemic. Thus, increased resilience of older adults demonstrated previously extends to the context of the onset of a pandemic.

A total of 29 left-over lung specimens that were obtained from patients who died from severe falciparum malaria were examined. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that ARDS coexisted with pulmonary edema and systemic bleeding; the severity was dependent on the level of hemozoin deposition in the lung and internal alveolar hemorrhaging. The loss of EPCR and TM was primarily identified in ARDS patients and was related to the level of hemozoin, parasitized red blood cell (PRBC) and white blood cell accumulation in the lung. Moreover, an in vitro analysis demonstrated that interleukin-13 and -31 and hemozoin induced pneumocytic cell injury and apoptosis, as assessed by EB/AO staining, electron microscopy and the up-regulation of CARD-9 mRNA (caspase recruitment domain-9 messenger-ribonucleic acid). The dysregulation of EPCR and TM in the lung, especially in those with increased levels of hemozoin, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS through an apoptotic pathway.","output":"Dysregulation of pulmonary endothelial protein C receptor and thrombomodulin in severe falciparum malaria-associated ARDS relevant to hemozoin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Triplet-drug regimen bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) and bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRD) are considered as standard of care induction prior autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in myeloma.

METHODS: To identify subgroups of patients at risk for unintended health consequences of social distancing, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from a national cohort study of older Veterans with advanced CKD (n=223). Characteristics included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (IADLs), cognition score, depression score, social support, financial stress, symptom burden, and number of chronic conditions. Unintended consequences of social distancing included restricted Life Space mobility, low willingness for video telehealth, reduced in-person contact with caregivers, and food insecurity. We identified subgroups of patients at risk of unintended consequences using model-based recursive partitioning (MoB). RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 77.9 years, 64.6% were white, and 96.9% were male. Overall, 22.4% of participants had restricted Life Space, 33.9% reported low willingness for video telehealth, 19.0% reported reduced caregiver contact, and 3.2% reported food insecurity. For Life Space restriction, four subgroups partitioned (i.e., split) by IADL difficulty, cognition score, and ADL difficulty were identified. The highest rate of restricted Life Space was 54.7% in the subgroup of participants with >3 IADL difficulties For low willingness for telehealth and reduced caregiver contact, separate models identified two subgroups split by cognition score and depression score, respectively.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20C24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LAY ABSTRACT: What is already known about the topic?There has been a lot of research into things like how autistic people's communication styles are different to those of non-autistic people, especially among children. This has tended to focus on parent reports and experiments, rather than asking autistic people about their own experiences and preferences regarding communication.What does this article add?This article is the first to ask autistic adults how they prefer to communicate in different scenarios. We asked whether they preferred to use a range of methods, such email, phone calls, letters and live messaging, in scenarios from education to customer services to friends and family. When contacting unknown people or organisations, we found that generally email was preferred, and phone calls were very unpopular. However, for friends, family and people they felt comfortable with, they preferred both face-to-face and written forms of communication (e.g. email and text message).Implications for practice, research or policyThe findings suggest that services should move away from a reliance on phone calls for communication. They should make sure that access to support is not dependent on the phone, and instead offer written options such as email and live messaging which are more accessible. Future research should investigate the impact of COVID-19 on autistic people's communication preferences, as video calling has become much more commonly used and potentially combines benefits and challenges of other modes discussed in this article.","output":"'Anything but the phone!': Communication mode preferences in the autism community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the negative impacts of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) emergency on small- and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) business continuity (BC) by examining the moderating role of corporate governance principles (CGP) on SMEs' BC in the context of an emerging market. Design/methodology/approach Based on an extended literature review on the negative impacts of the COVID-19 emergency, CGP and BC studies, the authors evaluate the impact of these constructs on SMEs' BC in an emerging market. This paper follows a quantitative approach. The study sample was composed of 334 responses covering directors, managers and owners of enterprises. The Smart PLS SEM version 3.3.2 was used to analyse the data from SMEs of Vietnam in the year 2021. Findings The findings of this study clarify the areas of the COVID-19 consequences that negatively affect the BC. In addition, this study reveals that CGP moderates the links between COVID-19 outcomes and BC, whereby good CGP can facilitate a business to reduce the adverse effects of COVID-19 on BC. In addition to this, good CGP can help a firm to enhance its capability to respond to fluctuations in the external environment of the business. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first research that examines the moderating role of CGP. The originality of this study is that it gives an insight into how SMEs in an emerging economy overcome the adverse effects of the COVID-19 emergency on BC to keep their business going, and moreover, have the ability to move towards sustainability in today's challenging context.

Most counting networks apply a multi-branch network structure to obtain different scales of head features. Although they have achieved promising results, they do not perform very well on the extreme scale variation scene due to the limited scale representability. Meanwhile, these methods are prone to recognize background objects as foreground crowds in complex scenes due to the limited context and high-level semantic information. We propose a compositional multi-scale feature enhanced learning approach (COMAL) for crowd counting to handle the above limitations. COMAL enhances the multi-scale feature representations from three aspects: (1) The semantic enhanced module (SEM) is developed for embedding the high-level semantic information to the multi-scale features; (2) The diversity enhanced module (DEM) is proposed to enrich the variety of crowd features different scales; (3) The context enhanced module (CEM) is designed for strengthening the multi-scale features with more context information. Based on the proposed COMAL, we develop a crowd counting network under the encoder-decoder framework and perform extensive experiments on ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, and UCF-QNRF datasets. Qualitative and quantitive results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed COMAL.","output":"COMAL: compositional multi-scale feature enhanced learning for crowd counting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monopolar electrocautery is a fast and elegant cutting option. However, as it creates surgical smoke containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), it may be hazardous to the health of the surgical team. Although new technologies, such as feedback mode (FM) and Teflon-coated blades (TBs), reduce tissue damage, their impact on surgical smoke creation has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we analyzed the plume at its source.The aim of this study was to evaluate if electrocautery FM and TBs create less surgical smoke.Porcine tissue containing skin was cut in a standardized manner using sharp-edged Teflon-coated blades (SETBs), normal-shaped TBs, or stainless steel blades (SSBs). Experiments were performed using FM and pure-cut mode. Surgical smoke was sucked through filters or adsorption tubes. Subsequently, filters were scanned and analyzed using a spectrophotometer. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) was performed to detect benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and phenanthrene as 2 of the most critical PAHs. Temperature changes at the cutting site were measured by an infrared thermometer.In FM, more surgical smoke was created using SSB compared with TBs (P < 0.001). Furthermore, differences between FM and pure-cut mode were found for SSB and TB (P < 0.001), but not for SETB (P = 0.911). Photometric analysis revealed differences in the peak heights of the PAH spectrum. In HLPC-UV, the amount of BaP and phenanthrene detected was lower for TB compared with SSB. Tissue temperature variations increased when SSB was used in FM and pure-cut mode. Furthermore, different modes revealed higher temperature variations with the use of SETB (P = 0.004) and TB (P = 0.005) during cutting, but not SSB (P = 0.789).We found that the use of both TBs and FM was associated with reduced amounts of surgical smoke created during cutting. Thus, the surgical team may benefit from the adoption of such new technologies, which could contribute to the primary prevention of smoke-related diseases.","output":"Electrocautery Devices With Feedback Mode and Teflon-Coated Blades Create Less Surgical Smoke for a Quality Improvement in the Operating Theater."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Market reactions to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) provide new insights into how real shocks and financial policies drive firm value.

This study examined the impact of histone neutralization in a rat model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) double-hit. Methods Sixty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to sham (N=8, received saline only) or LPS (N=60). The LPS double-hit consisted of a 0.8 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection followed after 16 hours by 5 mg/kg intra-tracheal nebulized LPS. The LPS group was then randomized into five groups: LPS only (N=12); LPS + 5, 25, or 100 mg/kg intravenous STC3141 every 8 hours (LPS+L, LPS+M, LPS+H, respectively, each N=12); or LPS + intraperitoneal dexamethasone 2.5 mg/kg every 24 hours for 56 hours (LPS+D, N=12) The animals were observed for 72 hours. Results LPS animals developed ALI as suggested by lower oxygenation, lung edema formation, and histological changes compared to the sham animals. Compared to the LPS group, LPS+H and +D animals had significantly lower circulating histone levels; only the LPS+D group had significantly lower bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) histone concentrations. The LPS+L, +M, +H and +D groups had improved oxygenation compared to the LPS group and the LPS+H and +D groups had a lower lung wet-to-dry ratio. All animals survived. Conclusion Neutralization of histone using STC3141, especially at high dose, had similar therapeutic effects to dexamethasone in this LPS double-hit rat ALI model, with significantly decreased circulating histone concentration, improved oxygenation, and decreased lung edema formation.","output":"Histone neutralization in a rat model of acute lung injury induced by double-hit lipopolysaccharide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dual career allows elite athletes to attain their maximum competitive and academic performance, but the COVID-19 pandemic hindered their development and changed their perception of the importance given to the sporting and educational environment.

METHODS: Eleven patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimens were enrolled in the hospital. Plasma cytokine, peripheral T cell proportions, and microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses for gene expression were conducted. RESULTS: Five patients with mild and 6 with severe disease were included. Cough and fever were the primary symptoms in the 11 COVID-19 cases. Older age, higher neutrophil count, and higher C-reactive protein levels were found in severe cases. IL-10 level significantly varied with disease progression and treatment. Decreased T-cell proportions were observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and all were returned to normal in patients with mild disease after initial treatment, but only CD4+ T cells returned to normal in severe cases. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the disease progression, and decreased after initial treatment. All downregulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved Th17-cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and T-cell activation. After initial treatment in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.

RESULTS: ACEI/ARB use did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality both in meta-analysis for 11 studies with 12 601 patients reporting ORs (OR=0.52 (95% CI=0.37 to 0.72), moderate certainty of evidence) and in 2 studies with 8577 patients presenting HRs. For 12 848 patients in 13 studies, ACEI/ARB use was not related to an increased risk of severe disease in COVID-19 (OR=0.68 (95% CI=0.44 to 1.07); I2=95%, low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB therapy was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality or severe manifestations in patients with COVID-19. ACEI/ARB therapy can be continued without concern of drug-related worsening in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system blocker and outcomes of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed as novel immunomodulatory drugs and primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have suggested that this category of anti-inflammatory drugs could be potentially useful for the control of inflammation storms in respiratory virus infections. In addition to their role in regulating immune cell functions, JAK1 and JAK2 have been recently identified as crucial cellular factors involved in influenza A virus (IAV) replication and could be potentially targeted for antiviral therapy. Gingerenone A (Gin A) is a compound derived from ginger roots and a dual inhibitor of JAK2 and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1). Our present study aimed to determine the antiviral activity of Gin A on influenza A virus (IAV) and to understand its mechanisms of action. Here, we reported that Gin A suppressed the replication of three IAV subtypes (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2) in four cell lines. IAV replication was also inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK inhibitor, but not by PF-4708671, an S6K1 inhibitor. JAK2 overexpression enhanced H5N1 virus replication and attenuated Gin A-mediated antiviral activity. In vivo experiments revealed that Gin A treatment suppressed IAV replication in the lungs of H5N1 virus-infected mice, alleviated their body weight loss, and prolonged their survival. Our study suggests that Gin A restricts IAV replication by inhibiting JAK2 activity; Gin A could be potentially useful for the control of influenza virus infections.","output":"In Vitro and In Vivo Antiviral Activity of Gingerenone A on Influenza A Virus Is Mediated by Targeting Janus Kinase 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has caused a global pandemic.

The increasing recognition of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 has sparked interest in the role of the nervous system in respiratory failure in people with COVID-19. However, the neuroimmune interactions in the lung in the context of ARDS are poorly understood. In this Perspectives article, we propose the concept of the neuroimmune unit as a critical determinant of lung function in the context of COVID-19, inflammatory conditions and ageing, focusing particularly on the involvement of the vagus nerve.

This research describes the clinical characteristics of MIS-C in critically ill children in middle-income countries and the factors associated with the rate of mortality and patients with critical outcomes. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted in 14 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Colombia between April 01, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Patient age ranged between one month and 18 years, and each patient met the requirements set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) for MIS-C. RESULTS: There were seventy-eight children in this study. The median age was seven years (IQR 1-11), 18 % (14/78) were under one year old, and 56 % were male. 35 % of patients (29/78) were obese or overweight. The PICU stay per individual was six days (IQR 4-7), and 100 % had a fever upon arrival to the clinic lasting at least five days (IQR 3.7-6). 70 % (55/78) of patients had diarrhea, and 87 % (68/78) had shock or systolic myocardial dysfunction (78 %). Coronary aneurysms were found in 35 % (27/78) of cases, and pericardial effusion was found in 36 %. When compared to existing data in high-income countries, there was a higher mortality rate observed (9 % vs. 1.8 %; p=0.001). When assessing the group of patients that did not survive, a higher frequency of ferritin levels was found, above 500 ngr/mL (100 % vs. 45 %; p=0.012), as well as more cardiovascular complications (100 % vs. 54 %; p = 0.019) when compared to the group that survived. The main treatments received were immunoglobulin (91 %), vasoactive support (76 %), steroids (70.5 %) and antiplatelets (44 %). CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children due to SARS-CoV-2 in critically ill children living in a middle-income country has some clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics similar to those described in high-income countries. The observed inflammatory response and cardiovascular involvement were conditions that, added to the later presentation, may explain the higher mortality seen in these children.

Current preoperative assessment of the future liver remnant relies upon assumptions which may not be valid in the setting of advanced resection strategies. This paper reports the feasibility of the ALIIVE technique which assesses the liver remnant with ICG clearance intraoperatively during vascular exclusion. Methods. 10 patients undergoing planned major liver resection (hemihepatectomy or greater) were recruited. Routine preoperative assessment included CT and standardized volumetry. ICG clearance was measured noninvasively using a finger spectrophotometer at various time points including following parenchymal transection during inflow and outflow occlusion before vascular division, the ALIIVE step. Results. There were one case of mortality and three cases of posthepatectomy liver failure. The patient who died had the lowest ALIIVE ICG clearance (7.1%/min versus 14.4  4.9). Routine preoperative CT and standardized volumetry did not predict outcome. Discussion/Conclusion. The novel ALIIVE technique is feasible and assesses actual future liver remnant function before the point of no return during major hepatectomy. This technique may be useful as a check step to offer a margin of safety to prevent posthepatectomy liver failure and death.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients will be recruited from 3 hospitals in Wenzhou China: the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and Wenzhou Center Hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria 1. Participants are 18-85 years of age, either male or female. 2. Diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3. Symptomatic. Mild (mild clinical symptoms without signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) and Moderate (fever or respiratory symptom with signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray) . 1. Signed the informed consent before treatment. 2. Agreed not to enroll in any other clinical trials. 3. Inpatients Exclusion criteria 1. < 18 or > 85 years old. 2. Pregnancy and lactation. 3. Serious heart, liver, kidney and hematopoietic system diseases, abnormal liver or kidney function. 4. Suffering from other known virus pneumonia. 5. Allergic to Chinese herbal medicine or suffering from allergies. 6. Critical patients (respiratory failure treated by mechanical ventilation or shock or multiple organ failure). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the control group will receive routine supportive clinically care including the therapies of anti-viral, anti-bacterial and ameliorating the related symptoms, while patients in TCM group will be asked to take maxingshigan-weijing decoction (composed of 14 Chinese herbal medicines), orally 200 mL 2 times daily, for 14 consecutive days in addition to routine supportive care as mentioned above. Maxingshigan-weijing decoction consists of 10 g of Herba Ephedra (Mahuang), 10 g of Amygdalus Communis Vas (Xingren), 45 g of Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao), 30 g of Rhizoma phragmitis (Lugen), 20 g of Peach kernel (Taoren), 20 g of Winter Melon kernel (Dongguaren), 30 g of Trichosanthes Kirilowii Maxim (Gualou), 12 g of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae (Chenpi), 12 g of Rhizoma Pinelliae (Jiangbanxia), 12 g of caulis bambusae in taeniis (Zhuru), 30 g of semen lepidii (Tingliz), 15 g of semen lepidii (Shichangpu), 10 g of curcuma zedoary (ezhu) and 5 g of Radix Glycyrrhizae (Gancao). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the number of days until the clinical symptom of fever improves in the first 14 days of treatment following randomisation. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37C. Secondary outcomes will be TCM Syndrome Scores, the time it takes until individuals have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, the proportion of cases with chest X-ray improvements and the rate of symptom (fever, cough, malaise, shortness of breath) recovery. TCM Syndrome Scoring System is a checklist covering 4 main, 7 secondary and 13 accompanying items. The 4 main items consisting of fever, cough, malaise and shortness of breath, use a four-point scale (0, 2, 4 and 6) depending on the severity; the 7 secondary items including dysphoria, diarrhea, pharyngalgia, expectoration, muscular soreness, nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea use 0-3-point scale; the 13 accompanying items contain chest pain, headache, aversion to cold, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal distension, dry mouth, anxiety, spontaneous sweating, insomnia, wheezing and blood tinged sputum, and each item is rated on 0-1 scale ( 0 stands for asymptomatic, 1 stands for symptomatic ). The total scores sum up to a range from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating more severe levels of disease. RANDOMIZATION: Minimization method will be used, balancing the two arms for pneumonia severity. Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group. Clinical researchers will get a random sequence number which is automatically generated by a random number generator (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and sequentially number them in an opaque envelope. Researchers will open random allocation envelopes and assign participants accordingly. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into a routine supportive care group and a routine supportive care plus oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine group, with 70 patients in each group. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study. The statistical analysis will be carried out by the Professor of Statistics at Wenzhou Medical University, who is blinded to patient allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The previous study reported the efficacy of TCM for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the TCM group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Accordingly, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test will be used.

In the case of COVID-19, many governments have responded to the ongoing pandemic by imposing social policies that restrict contacts outside of the home, resulting in a large fraction of the workforce either working from home or not working. To ensure essential services, however, a substantial number of workers are not subject to these limitations, and maintain many of their pre-intervention contacts. To explore how contacts among such essential workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several mathematical models of essential worker contacts within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, as has been documented, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent controls on contacts among the rest of the population to manage the pandemic. Importantly, however, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic dynamics, highlighting the need to understand and target intervention for the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers.

Although large-intestine microbiota have been linked to several GI diseases, the microbiota of the human small intestine and its relation to human disease has been understudied. The small intestine is the major site for immune surveillance in the gut, and compared with the large intestine, it has greater than 100 times the surface area and a thinner and more permeable mucus layer. RESULTS Using quantitative sequencing, we evaluated total and taxon-specific absolute microbial loads from 250 duodenal-aspirate samples and 21 paired duodenum-saliva samples from participants in the REIMAGINE study. Log-transformed total microbial loads spanned 5 logs and were normally distributed. Paired saliva-duodenum samples suggested potential transmission of oral microbes to the duodenum, including organisms from the HACEK group. Several taxa, including Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Clostridium, seemed to displace strict anaerobes common in the duodenum, so we refer to these taxa as disruptors. Disruptor taxa were enriched in samples with high total microbial loads and in individuals with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Absolute loads of disruptors were associated with more severe GI symptoms, highlighting the value of absolute taxon quantification when studying small-intestine health and function. CONCLUSION This study provides the largest dataset of the absolute abundance of microbiota from the human duodenum to date. The results reveal a clear relationship between the oral microbiota and the duodenal microbiota and suggest an association between the absolute abundance of disruptor taxa, SIBO, and the prevalence of severe GI symptoms.

Method: 74 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this prospective research. The demographic information, medical history, symptoms, signs and laboratory results were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. The leukocytes, lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were longitudinally collected. Results: : Of the 74 patients included, 17 suffered from severe disease. The severe patients tended be older (65.29  12.33 years vs. 45.37  18.66 years), and had a greater degree of underlying disease (41.18% vs. 24.56%) , lower baseline lymphocytes counts (0.69  0.36  10? vs. 1.46  0.75  10?) , higher neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratios (NLRs;3.76 (3.15C5.51) vs. 2.07 (1.48C2.93)) and lower baseline eosinophil counts (0.01  0.01  10? vs. 0.05  0.07  10?), than that in non-severe patients.

The aim of our paper is to explore the current attitudes of oculoplastic surgeons towards telemedicine and its utility in the present landscape and its prospects in the future. METHODS: A 39-item questionnaire was distributed to consultant oculoplastic surgeons practising across the UK and anonymised responses were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed rapid implementation of telemedicine services in oculoplastic departments across the UK with 86.6% of the respondents incorporating telemedicine into the routine clinical practice. Clinicians reported a statistically significant increase in utility of telemedicine, confidence in using telemedicine and quality of infrastructure available to employ telemedicine following the COVID-19 outbreak. The greatest utility of telemedicine is in triaging, postoperative assessment and eyelid lesion assessment. Main barriers to implementation of telemedicine included difficulties in conducting clinical examinations, lack of administrative support and poor access to digital technologies for patients. Overall, most clinicians were satisfied with the impact of telemedicine services and almost all experts foresee themselves continuing to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has become an integral part of the oculoplastic service delivery since the COVID-19 pandemic its use is likely to continue. Further development of digital infrastructure and improvement of clinical examination capabilities are required to enable its wider adoption.","output":"Telemedicine in oculoplastic and adnexal surgery: clinicians' perspectives in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate changes in sleep during the COVID-19 outbreak, and used data-driven approaches to identify distinct profiles of changes in sleep-related behaviours. Demographic, behavioural and psychological factors associated with sleep changes were also investigated. An online population survey assessing sleep and mental health was distributed between 3 April and 24 June 2020. Retrospective questions were used to estimate temporal changes from before to during the outbreak. In 5,525 Canadian respondents (67.1% females, 16-95 years old: Mean  SDa? =a? 55.6  16.3 years), wake-up times were significantly delayed relative to pre-outbreak estimates (p < .001, ? p 2 = 0.04). Occurrences of clinically meaningful sleep difficulties significantly increased from 36.0% before the outbreak to 50.5% during the outbreak (all p < .001, g &#8805; 0.27). Three subgroups with distinct profiles of changes in sleep behaviours were identified: \\"Reduced Time in Bed\\", \\"Delayed Sleep\\" and \\"Extended Time in Bed\\". The \\"Reduced Time in Bed\\" and \\"Delayed Sleep\\" subgroups had more adverse sleep outcomes and psychological changes during the outbreak. The emergence of new sleep difficulties was independently associated with female sex, chronic illnesses, being employed, family responsibilities, earlier wake-up times, higher stress levels, as well as heavier alcohol use and television exposure. The heterogeneity of sleep changes in response to the pandemic highlights the need for tailored interventions to address sleep problems.","output":"Profiles of sleep changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Demographic, behavioural and psychological factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Red blood cell (RBC) dataset was obtained from four thalassemia peripheral blood smears and a healthy peripheral blood smear.

The present study investigated the genotypic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains and reference IBVs based on S1 gene comparisons and the protection provided by vaccination with commercial vaccines and attenuated homologous and heterologous strains. Phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of S1 showed that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type virus might be a new serotype compared to vaccine strains and other types of IBV isolates in China. Protection efficacy was evaluated by morbidity, mortality, and virus re-isolation from the challenged chicks. Complete protection by IBV vaccination was provided by the homologous strain but sufficient respiratory protection was not provided by the commercial vaccines. Heterologous strains against CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge and the development of a vaccine against CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV will be necessary to control infectious bronchitis disease in poultry.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, the large majority of Chinese patients cannot meet the target level of LDL-C recommended by the Chinese expert consensus. Evolocumab has been demonstrated to reduce LDL-C by approximately 60% in many studies. Nevertheless, whether combined evolocumab and moderate-intensity statin is as effective in lowering LDL-C and decreasing incidence of MACE in Chinese patients presenting with the acute phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains unknown. Therefore, the Evolocumab added to Moderate-Intensity Statin therapy on LDL-C lowering and cardiovascular adverse events in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (EMSIACS) is conducted. Methods: The EMSIACS is a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study involving analyzing the feasibility and efficacy of evolocumab added to moderate-intensity statin therapy on lowering LDL-C levels in adult Chinese patients hospitalized for acute phase ACS. The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome, and 500 patients will be planned to recruit. Patients are randomized in evolocumab arm (evolocumab 140mg every 2weeks plus rosuvastatin 10mg/day or atorvastatin 20mg/day) and statin-only arm (rosuvastatin 10mg/day or atorvastatin 20mg/day). The primary outcome is the percentage change in LDL-C in weeks 4 and week 12 after treatment. The secondary outcome is the occurrence of MACE after 12weeks and 1year of treatment. Discussion: If the EMSIACS trial endpoints prove statistically significant, the evolocumab added to moderate-intensity statin therapy will have the potential to effectively lower subjects LDL-C levels, especially for the Chinese patients with acute phase ACS. However, if the risk of MACE is not significantly different between the two groups, we may extend follow-up time for secondary outcome when the clinical trial is over.

Virtual cycling (eCycling) has grown exponentially, and its popularity among amateur and professional cyclists is shown by the fact that they regularly participate in virtual competitions in which people from all over the world interact via streaming. Although eCycling is derived from a traditional sport and adapted to a virtual platform, its future success once real competitions are reinstated has been seriously questioned. This virtual cycling modality has been openly criticized for the potential differences when competing and that it does not represent the true essence of cycling. These questions and the lack of clear guidelines for its competition suggest that eCycling has to go a long way before being considered a sport.

METHODS The study included 115 patients, of which 65 patients in the case group with Real time reversetranscription-polymerasechainreaction test positive and diagnosed for COVID-19 and 50 volunteers in the control group. Patients with COVID-19 were classified as moderate/severe or mild COVID-19 in the subgroup analysis based on the severity of the disease. We investigated the relationship between cardio-ankle vascular index and COVID-19 by using the VaSera VS-1000 device to automatically measure each patient's cardio-ankle vascular index and ankle-brachial pressure index. RESULTS The mean age of participants included in the study was 65.710.7 years. Patients and volunteers were statistically similar in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity index scores, and body mass index values (p>0.05). The right-cardio-ankle vascular index value was 9.62.4 in the case group and 8.51.1 in the control group (p=0.004). The left-cardio-ankle vascular index value was 9.42.7 in the case group and 8.51.2 in the control group (p=0.01). The right-cardio-ankle vascular index value was 10.83.4 in the moderate/severe disease group and 8.80.9 in the mild disease group (p=0.008). The left-cardio-ankle vascular index value was 10.73.6 in the moderate/severe disease group and 8.51.5 in the mild disease group (p<0.001). The right-cardio-ankle vascular index and left-cardio-ankle vascular index values were found to be significantly higher in COVID-19 patients in our study.

In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/l, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.","output":"A CRISPR-Cas12a-derived biosensor enabling portable personal glucose meter readout for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Woad root has been used for the prevention of influenza for hundreds of years in many Asian countries.

METHODS: The present study was conducted on 81st year medical and dental students who were admitted to their respective college in August 2019 and were willing to participate in the study. A multiple choice close-ended questionnaire regarding their opinion on virtual classes was designed and feedback was taken from the students. RESULTS: Majority (65%) of the students agreed that they missed their traditional anatomy learning i.e., dissection courses, face to face lectures and interaction with mentors. The students strongly felt the lack of confidence and difficulty in the topics completed without dissections, models, microscopic slides and other modalities. 83% felt lack of proper gadgets, high-band width and strong internet connections, a potential barrier in their digital learning.

However this social restriction led to disturbed daily routine and lifestyle behaviour that is needed to be attended for proper therapeutic management of overall health during such crisis. The impact of lockdown on the most apparent behavioral changes viz. sleep-wake behaviour, major meal timings, and digital screen duration of Indians were investigated. In addition the effects of gender and age were explored. METHODS: After seeking permission from Ethical Institution, an online questionnaire based survey was circulated within India in the first week of May, 2020 for which total 1511 male and female (age 18 years) subjects participated. The sleep-wake behavior observed were sleep-wake timings, sleep duration, mid sleep time (MST) as function of lockdown, and social (lockdown) jetlag (SJL = MST before lockdown-MST during lockdown). RESULTS: The sleep onset-wakeup and meal times were significantly delayed during lockdown, which was more pronounced in younger age group. The sleep duration increased, specifically in young individuals during lockdown. Females showed more delayed sleep onset-waking times and first meal timing with longer sleep duration during lockdown. Increased digital media duration was observed in all age groups, primarily in males. The younger age group and specifically female reported higher SJL and delayed MST. A positive association was obtained between sleep duration & first meal time, and SJL & major meal timings/screen duration, and a significant negative relationship of sleep duration and SJL with age. CONCLUSION: The study shows delayed sleep-wake schedule, meal timings and increased digital media duration among Indians during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before lockdown. Also, gender and age emerged as important mediating factors for this alteration. The pandemic has given opportunity to sleep more and compensate for the sleep. In spite of that, the higher social jetlag in young age group and female showed the compromised sleep and maladaption with societal timing.

AIM: First, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid nucleocapsid protein antigen detection (RAD) assays (Biosynex, Biotical, Orient Gene, Panbio, SD Biosensor). Secondly, we described the performance and impact of the implementation of the SD Biosensor assay at our emergency department. METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of the five RAD assays were analyzed on 100 respiratory samples: 60 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, 24 SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative samples and 16 samples positive for other respiratory pathogens. We adapted the manufacturer's protocol, to validate the antigen tests on transport media used for rRT-PCR in our routine practice. The SD Biosensor RAD assay was implemented as screening method for rapid diagnosis and targeted admission. FINDINGS: Sensitivity of the included RAD assays ranged from 88.9% to 100% for samples with Ct <26, specificity from 46.2% to 100%. During the implementation period, 4195 RAD tests were performed. Due to the rapid RAD result, 157 patients were transferred directly to the COVID-19 cohort instead of the regular ward (n=47) or the temporary COVID-19 ward (n=110). CONCLUSION: The SD Biosensor, Biotical and Panbio SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests had an acceptable overall performance and seem to be able to detect most of the contagious patients. In the context of high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, RAD tests can be used as a rapid screening tool, to guide infection prevention measures and aid targeted admission.","output":"Comparison of five SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in a hospital setting and performance of one antigen assay in routine practice.

DAD is characterized by an acute phase with edema, hyaline membranes and inflammation followed by an organizing phase with pulmonary fibrosis and hyperplasia. The degree of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension is different in the pathological stages of DAD. The effects of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension on alveolar sac mechanics in DAD are investigated by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. A dynamic compression-relaxation model for surface tension effects is adopted. Compared to a healthy model, DAD models are created by increasing the tissue thickness and decreasing the concentration of the surfactant. The FSI results show that pulmonary fibrosis is more influential than the surface tension on flow rate, volume, P-V loop and resistance. The lungs of the disease models become stiffer than those of the healthy models. According to the P-V loop results, the surface tension plays a more important role in hysteresis than the material nonlinearity of the lung tissue.

Reports on the association of frailty with poor outcome have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the independent association between frailty and in-hospital mortality in older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: This was a multi-centre retrospective cohort study in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, including all patients aged &#8805;70 years, who were hospitalised with clinically confirmed COVID-19 between February and May 2020. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidity, disease severity and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,376 patients were included (median age 78 years (IQR 74-84), 60% male). In total, 499 (38%) patients died during hospital admission. Parameters indicating presence of frailty (CFS 6-9) were associated with more co-morbidities, shorter symptom duration upon presentation (median 4 vs. 7 days), lower oxygen demand and lower levels of CRP. In multivariable analyses, the CFS was independently associated with in-hospital mortality: compared to patients with CFS 1-3, patients with CFS 4-5 had a two times higher risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95%CI 1.3-3.0) and patients with CFS 6-9 had a three times higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.8 (95%CI 1.8-4.3)).

The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of, and patient characteristics associated with, delays in discharge at an urban county trauma service. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with data from Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFGH), a level-1 trauma center and safety net hospital in San Francisco, California. The study included 1720 patients from the trauma surgery service at ZSFGH. A delay in discharge was defined as days in the hospital, including an initial overnight stay, after all medical needs had been met. We used logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models to test whether the following factors were associated with prolonged, non-medical length of stay: age, gender, race/ethnicity, housing, disposition location, type of insurance, having a primary care provider, primary language and zip code. RESULTS: Of the 1720 patients, 15% experienced a delay in discharge, for a total of 1147 days (median 1.5 days/patient). The following were statistically significant (p<0.05) predictors of delays in discharge in a multivariable logistic regression model: older age, unhoused status or disposition to home health or postacute care (compared with home discharge) were associated with increased likelihood of delays. Having private insurance or Medicare (compared with public insurance) and discharge against medical advice or absent without leave (compared with home discharge) were associated with reduced likelihood of delays in discharge after all medical needs were met. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that policymakers interested in reducing non-medical hospital stays should focus on addressing structural determinants of health, such as lack of housing, bottlenecks at postacute care disposition destinations and lack of adequate insurance.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, matched-cohort administrative claims analysis using IBM MarketScan databases (2011C2017). Newly diagnosed, adult (18+ yrs) knee OA patients identified by ICD9/10 code were matched 1:1 to controls by age, sex, payer, and geography; alpha level set to 0.05. Prevalence was estimated for 2017. All-cause and knee OA-related HCRU&C reported per-patient-per-year (PPPY) over follow-up period up to 4 years. RESULTS: Overall 2017 knee OA prevalence was 4% (615,514 knee OA/15.4M adults). A total of 510,605 patients meeting inclusion criteria were matched 1:1 with controls. The knee OA cohort had mean age 60 years and was 58% female. Versus controls, knee OA patients had significantly more PPPY outpatient (84.5 versus 45.0) and pharmacy (29.8 versus 19.8) claims, and significantly higher PPPY outpatient costs ($12,571 versus $6,465), and pharmacy costs ($3,655 versus $2,038). Knee OA patients incurred $7,707 more PPPY total healthcare costs than controls, of which $4,674 (60.6%) were knee OA-related medical claims and $1,926 (25%) were knee OA-related medications of interest. PPPY costs for nonselective NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, intraarticular hyaluronic acid, non-acute opioids, and knee replacement were higher for knee OA patients than controls. Using median and mean all-cause total cost ($9,330 and $24,550, respectively), the estimated sum cost of knee OA patients in MarketScan ranged from $5.7B to $15B annually. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis demonstrated an annual 2017 prevalence of 4.0% (18 years) and 13.2% (65 years) for newly diagnosed knee OA patients. Compared with controls, all-cause costs were significantly higher for knee OA patients, nearly double that of matched controls, attributable to increased medical and treatment costs and comorbidity treatment burden.

Rabbits were infected with 2  10(4) hemagglutination units of a RHDV isolate and received 20 mg/kg melatonin at 0, 12, and 24 hr postinfection. RHDV induced autophagy, with increased expression of beclin\\\\1, ubiquitin\\\\like autophagy\\\\related (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and sequestrosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) staining, and conversion of LC3\\\\I to autophagosome\\\\associated LC3\\\\II.

A semi-structured questionnaire guide was developed using ground theory to conduct in-depth interviews. A total of 36 participants gave consent for an audio-recorded interview. Results have shown that most of the respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 is a natural virus, not man-made, that causes a disease just like other viruses and it is absurd to believe that the vaccine is being used by foreign powers for the implantation of microchips just to control humans. A general opinion thatwhich reflected from the in-depth interview is that the pharmaceutical companies may be hiding some important information on COVID-19 to promote the sale of their product. Some doubts on the reliability and trustworthiness on the COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy data were noticed among the respondents. Factors leading to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were adverse reaction, cost of COVID-19 vaccine, and limited data on safety and efficacy profile of COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health professionals is a major hindrance to our current fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Findings of this study are alarming, and the stakeholders must consider this ongoing vaccination campaign as an opportunity to formulate a mechanism to ensure high vaccination rate among general public and healthcare providers in Pakistan. KEY POINTS What was already known? According to World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is one of the ten major threats to global healthcare system and it is a major barrier to achieve herd immunity around the globe. Pakistan has begun vaccinating its people in a systematic phase-wise manner under which the healthcare workers and elderly people are prioritized for vaccination. Previous experience tells us that vaccine hesitancy is a major problem in Pakistan and it is better to understand perceptions of pharmacists about COVID-19 vaccine who are the primary source of information for most of general population. What this study adds: This study is first of its kind to explore vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists and the results of this study show that majority of the participants were willing to get COVID-19 vaccine and few of them have even got themselves vaccinated at the start of vaccination campaign. Many among the willing participants considered cost of vaccine, adverse reactions, limited data, safety, and efficacy as major hindrance to their decision to get vaccine. Few participants were found highly vaccine-hesitant because of their staunch belief in the prevalent myths and rumors about COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"A qualitative insight into the perceptions and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Pakistani pharmacists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective: to report the experience of developing pedagogical mediations in a Virtual Learning Environment implemented in a nursing faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic Methods: an experience report on the construction of a distance course aimed at graduates and residents of a nursing faculty at a public university located in the city of Rio de Janeiro Results: the course&#039;s conception, operationalization and implementation were the result of a collective work that culminated in a non-formal, virtual and problematic teaching process, which reached a participation rate of 82% of enrolled students Final considerations: even in times of social isolation, the course promoted collaborative learning of knowledge about COVID-19 and strengthened the relationship between professors and students The possibility of carrying out distance activities based on solid methodological proposals that contradict the content logic often observed in distance learning is emphasized RESUMEN Objetivo: reportar la experiencia de desarrollo de mediaciones pedaggicas en un Ambiente Virtual de Aprendizaje implementado en una facultad de enfermera durante la pandemia de COVID-19 Mtodos: relato de experiencia en la construccin de un curso a distancia dirigido a estudiantes &amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;y residentes de una facultad de enfermera de una universidad pblica ubicada en la ciudad de Ro de Janeiro Resultados: la concepcin, operacionalizacin e implementacin del curso fue el resultado de un trabajo colectivo que culmin en un proceso docente no formal, virtual y problemtico, que alcanz una tasa de participacin del 82% de los estudiantes matriculados Consideraciones finales: incluso en tiempos de aislamiento social, el curso promovi el aprendizaje colaborativo de conocimientos sobre COVID-19, fortaleciendo las relaciones entre profesores y alumnos Se enfatiza la posibilidad de realizar actividades a distancia basadas en propuestas metodolgicas slidas que contradicen la lgica de contenido frecuentemente observada en Educacin a Distancia RESUMO Objetivo: relatar a experincia do desenvolvimento de media??es pedaggicas em Ambiente Virtual de Aprendizagem implementadas em uma faculdade de enfermagem durante a pandemia de COVID-19 Mtodos: relato de experincia da constru??o de um curso a distancia voltado para graduandos e residentes de uma faculdade de enfermagem de uma universidade pblica situada no municpio do Rio de Janeiro Resultados: a concep??o, operacionaliza??o e implementa??o do curso foi fruto de um trabalho coletivo que culminou em um processo de ensino n?o formal, virtual e problematizador, o qual alcan?ou taxa de participa??o de 82% dos educandos inscritos Considera??es finais: mesmo em tempos de isolamento social, o curso promoveu a aprendizagem colaborativa de conhecimentos acerca da COVID-19, estreitando as rela??es entre docentes e educandos Ressalta-se a possibilidade de realizar atividades a distancia baseadas em propostas metodolgicas slidas que contrariam a lgica conteudista frequentemente observada na Educa??o a Distancia","output":"Pedagogical mediations for non-formal nursing teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Tissue Engineering & Regenerative Medicine International Society-Europe (TERMIS-EU) Industry Committee as well as its TERMIS-Americas (AM) counterpart intend to address the specific challenges and needs facing the industry in translating academic research into commercial products.

These topics were introduced by providing the synergistic business perspective of partnering between the multiple regenerative medicine stakeholders, throughout the life cycle of product development. Seven industry leaders were invited to share their experience, expertise, and strategies. Due to the complex nature of regenerative medicine products, partnering for their successful commercial development seems inevitable to overcome all obstacles by sharing experiences and expertise of all stakeholders. When ideally implemented, the \\"innovation quotient\\" of a virtual team resulting from the combination of internal and external project teams can be maximized through maximizing the three main dimensions: core competences, technology portfolio, and alliance management.","output":"Translating cell-based regenerative medicines from research to successful products: challenges and solutions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic produced by coronavirus2 (COVID-19) has confined the world, and avoiding close human contact is still suggested to combat the outbreak although the vaccination campaigns.

Several prevention and treatment strategies have been designed and evaluated in recent months either through the repurposing of existing treatments or the development of new drugs and vaccines. In this study, we show that L-carnitine tartrate supplementation in humans and rodents led to significant decreases of key host dependency factors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and Furin, which are responsible for viral attachment, viral spike S-protein cleavage, and priming for viral fusion and entry. Interestingly, pre-treatment of Calu-3, human lung epithelial cells, with L-carnitine tartrate led to a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of the infection by SARS-CoV-2. Infection inhibition coincided with a significant decrease in ACE2 mRNA expression levels. These data suggest that L-carnitine tartrate should be tested with appropriate trials in humans for the possibility to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"L-Carnitine Tartrate Downregulates the ACE2 Receptor and Limits SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Huge epidemiological and clinical studies have confirmed that black tea is a rich source of health-promoting ingredients, such as catechins and theaflavins (TFs).

The NHFD is a national database whereby markers of care are recorded prospectively for patients over 60 years sustaining a hip fracture and requiring inpatient care, with a Best Practice Tariff linked to key performance indicators. The aim of this study was to review how care varied for patients sustaining a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the equivalent time last year. METHODS: Using the NHFD we compared data from March C May 2019 to the same period in 2020 during the pandemic at St Georges Hospital. The study provides a snapshot of care during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were more admissions and more discharges during the pandemic. There was an increase in time to theatre and subsequent reduction in BPT. There was also an increase in non- operative treatment for these patients. 6 patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive, one of whom died. There was a reduction in time to ortho-geriatrician review and also a reduction in delirium review post-operatively. Length of stay was also reduced. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on care provided to hip fracture patients. There was an increase in time and a deterioration in orthogeriatric review within 72 hours. The length of stay however improved due to improved focus on pathways and discharge processes. There was also a lower threshold to offer non- operative care wherever possible.","output":"P46 Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on hip fracture patients in a Teaching London Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the restricted knowledge on the diversity of coronaviruses in poultry other than chicken, this study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of coronaviruses in quail, pheasant, and partridge from two regions of Northern Italy.

The two groups were compared with each other and the whole cohort was compared with non-COVID AP cohort. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients with SARS-CoV-2 plus AP (SARS-CoV-2-related AP; n = 18 and AP with SARS-CoV-2 superadded infection; n = 67) were included during the study period.

India can gain from enhanced investment in health workforce in multiple ways. This study in addition to presenting updated estimates on size and composition of health workforce, identifies areas of investment in health workforce in India. METHODS: We analyzed two sources of data: (i) National Health Workforce Account (NHWA) 2018 and (ii) Periodic Labour Force Survey 2017C2018 of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Using the two sources, we collated comparable estimates of different categories of health workers in India, density of health workforce and skill-mix at the all India and state levels. RESULTS: The study estimated (from NHWA 2018) a total stock of 5.76 million health workers which included allopathic doctors (1.16 million), nurses/midwives (2.34 million), pharmacist (1.20 million), dentists (0.27 million), and traditional medical practitioner (AYUSH 0.79 million). However, the active health workforce size estimated (NSSO 2017C2018) is much lower (3.12 million) with allopathic doctors and nurses/midwives estimated as 0.80 million and 1.40 million, respectively. Stock density of doctor and nurses/midwives are 8.8 and 17.7, respectively, per 10,000 persons as per NHWA. However, active health workers density (estimated from NSSO) of doctor and nurses/midwives are estimated to be 6.1 and 10.6, respectively. The numbers further drop to 5.0 and 6.0, respectively, after accounting for the adequate qualifications. All these estimates are well below the WHO threshold of 44.5 doctor, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population. The results reflected highly skewed distribution of health workforce across states, ruralCurban and publicCprivate sectors. A substantial proportion of active health worker were found not adequately qualified on the one hand and on the other more than 20% of qualified health professionals are not active in labor markets. CONCLUSION: India needs to invest in HRH for increasing the number of active health workers and also improve the skill-mix which requires investment in professional colleges and technical education. India also needs encouraging qualified health professionals to join the labor markets and additional trainings and skill building for already working but inadequately qualified health workers.

The initial wave of coronarivus infections saw a predominantly consultant-delivered service, limited antenatal education and restrictions on hospital visitors. We assessed the impact of the pandemic on adherence to EROSS bundles and hospital discharge. Methods: Caldicott Guardian approval was obtained to review data regarding planned CD across three maternity units in our health board over two time periods: 18 March C 14 July 2019 (baseline) and 16 March C 12 July 2020 (COVID). Data were extracted from electronic patient records (Badgernet) and cross-referenced with theatre data (Opera). Patient characteristics, EROSS bundle adherence and postoperative length of stay (LoS) were compared. Results: A total of 1306 planned CD were reviewed. Patient characteristics were similar. Bundle adherence, where recorded, was variable. LoS was recorded in all cases C median LoS was reduced in the COVID cohort, and day 1 discharge rates increased significantly. [Formula presented] Discussion: Despite challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, a planned CD service was successfully maintained in our region. Continuing the trend established over the preceding 4 years, median LOS was reduced. Day 1 discharges were significantly increased despite variable bundle compliance. Are these changes a natural continuation of the embedded EROSS pathway, or have perceived barriers to discharge (eg staff shortages, limited antenatal education, non-compliance with care bundles) been superseded by concerns around exposure to coronavirus while in hospital?

We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.10.6 (MeanSE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests.

During his stay in ICU, the patient developed transient ST segment elevation in inferior-lateral leads which promptly resolved without requiring any additional invasive and/or pharmacological treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction without any regional abnormalities and the rise in enzyme biomarkers was insignificant. The case highlights the importance of avoiding invasive procedures in this subset of patients to reduce both patient complications and medical staff exposure.

This article aims to develop some strategies in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of healthcare workforce and employees. METHODS: This is a prospectively registered and retrospective descriptive study investigating the clinical characteristics, results of diagnostic tests, and patients' disposition from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, at a tertiary medical center in Northern Taiwan. RESULTS: There is no nosocomial spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility. The following strategies were followed: information transparency; epidemic prevention resources planning by authorities; multidisciplinary cooperation; informative technologies; immigration quarantine policies; travel restrictions; management of diversion/subdivision; self-health monitoring; social distancing; screening of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history; traffic control bundling (TCB); training of using personal protective equipment; real-name visiting management; and employee care. The patients' basic characteristics and diagnostic results were gathered. Of the 3832 cases, about 25.9% had travel history. Most of them were traveling to Asia (419 people/time, 10.9%) and from China (256 people/time, 6.7%). Meanwhile, healthcare personnel accounted for 316 people/time (8.3%) and cleaning personnel, 6 people/time (0.16%). The 36 cases who care or have contact with confirmed cases have negative results from the COVID-19 test. The most frequent symptoms were fever and upper respiratory infection followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The above strategies were followed.

This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2-positive, asymptomatic, frail older adults. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 6 designated COVID-19 units, in skilled nursing homes. Subjects were severely frail older adults, positive for SARS-CoV-2, and asymptomatic at the time of their admission in these units. Residents' characteristics and symptoms were obtained via electronic medical records. The primary outcome was a composite of death or hospitalization by day 40. We looked at time to the primary outcome and used Cox regression for a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: During MarchCNovember 2020, 849 residents met inclusion criteria. Median age was 84 years. Most were completely dependent for basic activities of daily living and showed cognitive impairment. Six hundred forty-one (75.5%) residents were discharged after considered cured from COVID-19, 125 (14.7%) were hospitalized, and 82 (9.7%) died in the facilities. In survival analysis, 35% reached the primary outcome of death or hospitalization by day 40.

However, the frequency of advance care planning conversations in practice remains low. In-depth understanding of patients' experiences with advance care planning might provide clues to optimise its value to patients and improve implementation. AIM To synthesise and describe the research findings on the experiences with advance care planning of patients with a life-threatening or life-limiting illness. DESIGN A systematic literature review, using an iterative search strategy. A thematic synthesis was conducted and was supported by NVivo 11. DATA SOURCES The search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 7 November 2016. RESULTS Of the 3555 articles found, 20 were included. We identified three themes in patients' experiences with advance care planning. 'Ambivalence' refers to patients simultaneously experiencing benefits from advance care planning as well as unpleasant feelings. 'Readiness' for advance care planning is a necessary prerequisite for taking up its benefits but can also be promoted by the process of advance care planning itself. 'Openness' refers to patients' need to feel comfortable in being open about their preferences for future care towards relevant others. CONCLUSION Although participation in advance care planning can be accompanied by unpleasant feelings, many patients reported benefits of advance care planning as well. This suggests a need for advance care planning to be personalised in a form which is both feasible and relevant at moments suitable for the individual patient.","output":"Advance care planning: A systematic review about experiences of patients with a life-threatening or life-limiting illness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microarrays provide a powerful analytical tool for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in a single experiment. The specific affinity reaction of nucleic acids (hybridization) and antibodies towards antigens is the most common bioanalytical method for generating multiplexed quantitative results. Nucleic acid-based analysis is restricted to the detection of cells and viruses. Antibodies are more universal biomolecular receptors that selectively bind small molecules such as pesticides, small toxins, and pharmaceuticals and to biopolymers (e.g. toxins, allergens) and complex biological structures like bacterial cells and viruses. By producing an appropriate antibody, the corresponding antigenic analyte can be detected on a multiplexed immunoanalytical microarray. Food and water analysis along with clinical diagnostics constitute potential application fields for multiplexed analysis. Diverse fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemical, and label-free microarray readout systems have been developed in the last decade. Some of them are constructed as flow-through microarrays by combination with a fluidic system. Microarrays have the potential to become widely accepted as a system for analytical applications, provided that robust and validated results on fully automated platforms are successfully generated.

Cooperative Extension offers a potentially powerful context for DPP implementation, with a capacity to reach large and diverse populations. There is a critical need to understand the impact of the DPP when implemented with fidelity in Extension, as well as implementation barriers and facilitators. The objective of the present study was to evaluate barriers and facilitators of DPP implementation in Extension in Georgia. The present study was part of a 12-month, multi-site, hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial. The implementation evaluation utilized 3 qualitative semi-structured interviews (post-recruitment and mid- and post-implementation) with 12 Extension professionals implementing the DPP in 13 counties across all regions of Georgia. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify barriers and facilitators of DPP implementation in Extension. Interviews were coded deductively by 2 independent analysts based on CFIR constructs. Constructs were then rated (-2 to +2) to indicate their influence on implementation. Constructs with a strong influence on implementation were then evaluated for their influence on RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework domains. Preliminary analyses suggest that program length (Time [-2]) and the Intervention's Source (+2) from CDC had strong influences on Reach of the program;the DPP's Evidence Strength and Quality (+2) and the Tension for Change (+2) for more evidence-based Extension programming had strong positive influences on Adoption;and Networks and Communications (+2) had a strong positive influence on Implementation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extension's infrastructure, culture, and need for evidence-based programming make it well-suited for DPP implementation. Results of this study can inform implementation strategies to improve the public health impact of DPP implementation in Extension in the future. University of Georgia Interdisciplinary Seed Grant.

However, only a few studies covering this subject in Africa have been published. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of critically ill adult COVID-19 patientsall of whom had a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectionadmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax, Tunisia). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were admitted into our ICU for respiratory distress due to COVID-19 infection. Mean age was 62.412.8 years and median age was 64 years. Mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio was 10560 and 300 in all cases but one. Oxygen support was required for all patients (100%) and invasive mechanical ventilation for 38 (40%). Prone positioning was applied in 67 patients (70%). Within the study period, 47 of the 96 patients died (49%). Multivariate analysis showed that the factors associated with poor outcome were the development of acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75C25.9), the use of mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.54C22.0), and serum cholinesterase (SChE) activity lower than 5,000 UI/L (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.34C19).

This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a daily 14-h metabolic fast (14:10 TRE beginning after dinner, a fasting snack at hour 12, and ending with breakfast 14 h later) combined with a commercial weight management program on body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in individuals with obesity. We also investigated the effect of the low-calorie, high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-protein fasting snack on blood glucose. METHODS: This 8-week, randomized, controlled, clinical trial included men and women (BMI  30 kg/m(2)) between June and October 2020. Study procedures were conducted remotely. Participants were randomized to 14:10 or 12-h TRE (12:12, active comparator) and prescribed a diet (controlled for calories and macronutrient composition) and exercise program that included weekly customized counseling and support. The primary outcome was change from baseline in body weight in the 14:10 group. RESULTS: Of the 78 randomized participants, 60 (n = 30/group) completed 8 weeks. The LS mean change from baseline in weight in the 14:10 group was ?8.5% (95% CI ?9.6 to ?7.4; P < 0.001) and ?7.1% (?8.3 to ?5.8; P < 0.001) in the 12:12 group (between group difference ?1.4%; ?2.7 to ?0.2; P < 0.05).

SOURCES: A systemic search using the PubMed MEDLINE database was performed for all Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PADs) described in the 2020 IUIS Expert Committee for PID classification system, combined with terms for hypogammaglobulinemia. Search terms for PADs were based on the listed names and affected genes as classified by the IUIS 2020. Abstracts of the results were reviewed to find relevant case series, review articles of PADs associated with infection, opportunistic infection, autoimmunity, cytopenias, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, neurological and respiratory diseases. References from relevant articles were further reviewed for additional references. Relevant findings were grouped in accordance with the IUIS 2020 classification system. Clinical and genetic features, if known, were described. DATA SYNTHESIS: PADs refer to impaired antibody production due to molecular defects intrinsic to B cells or a failure of interaction between B and T cells. The patients develop recurrent or chronic infection or respond to the antigens with dysregulation of the immune function, causing severe allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation, lymphoproliferation and malignancy. The diagnosis is a combined exercise of clinical and laboratory investigation similar to that performed by Bruton (1952). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the experience of XLA and CVID patients has been surprising. Variants in 39 genes were reported as causing PADs, but the clinical heterogeneity within each variant is not clear. CONCLUSION: Bruton (1952) used clinical expertise and protein electrophoresis to identify XLA. The IUIS (2020) committee used immunoglobulins and B lymphocyte to characterize PADs.

In addition to their risk of direct exposure to the virus, they were subjected to long working hours, scarcity of PPE, and additional stressors that impacted their psychological wellbeing. The purpose of this study was to assess anxiety and its predictors among a sample of HCWs at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) and to evaluate the association between resilience and anxiety. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey between March and June 2021 among HCWs at AUBMC. The psychosocial scale section included the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale and a 25-item resilience scale, validated tools used to assess anxiety and resilience respectively. Data were analyzed on SPSS version 27, and descriptive statistics were applied. Predictors were evaluated using bivariate and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: From a total of 92 participants, 75% were involved in direct patient care, and of those, 95% worked directly with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. The majority (83%) had minimal to mild anxiety, whereas the rest had moderate to high anxiety levels. Around 41% reported moderately high to high resilience, 47% were found to be between the low end and moderate resilience scale and only 12% had very low or low resilience. More than 80% of the participants received PPE training, reported always working with adequate preventive infection control measures, and were vaccinated. Further, more than 70% of participants reported trusting the management and agreed that the safety of the workers is considered a high priority. No significant association between sociodemographic and COVID-19 work exposure factors with anxiety was found. Multivariate analysis results showed that a lower anxiety score was associated with higher resilience (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: This study has shown a strong association between low anxiety levels and high resilience scores in this group of mostly vaccinated HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients. The high percentage of vaccination along with PPE availability could explain the low anxiety levels reported among the participants.","output":"Anxiety Among Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Pandemic in Lebanon: The Importance of the Work Environment and Personal Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are fighting not only the novel coronavirus, but also the infodemic induced by the pandemic.

In this context, automatic summarization has substantial importance as it will provide the foundation for big data analytic. Traditional summarization approaches optimize the system to produce a short static summary that fits all users that do not consider the subjectivity aspect of summarization, i.e., what is deemed valuable for different users, making these approaches impractical in real-world use cases. This paper proposes an interactive concept-based summarization model, called Adaptive Summaries, that helps users make their desired summary instead of producing a single inflexible summary. The system learns from users' provided information gradually while interacting with the system by giving feedback in an iterative loop. Users can choose either reject or accept action for selecting a concept being included in the summary with the importance of that concept from users' perspectives and confidence level of their feedback. The proposed approach can guarantee interactive speed to keep the user engaged in the process. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for reference summaries, which is a challenging issue for summarization tasks. Evaluations show that Adaptive Summaries helps users make high-quality summaries based on their preferences by maximizing the user-desired content in the generated summaries.","output":"Adaptive Summaries: A Personalized Concept-based Summarization Approach by Learning from Users' Feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The obturator nerve and its accessory branch supplying the hip region, unlike the femoral nerve, are not adequately anaesthetized by conventional regional anaesthetic techniques targeting the hip region.

Indeed, critically ill patients show an impaired type I IFN response accompanied by elevated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, responsible for cell and tissue damage and associated multi-organ failure. Here, the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells was investigated by interrogating an in vitro human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based experimental model. We found that, even in absence of a productive viral replication, the virus mediates a vigorous TLR7/8-dependent production of both type I and III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, known to contribute to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed how virus-induced type I IFN secreted by PBMC enhances anti-viral response in infected lung epithelial cells, thus, inhibiting viral replication. This type I IFN was released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) via an ACE-2-indipendent mechanism. Viral sensing regulates pDC phenotype by inducing cell surface expression of PD-L1 marker, a feature of type I IFN producing cells. Coherently to what observed in vitro, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects displayed a similar pDC phenotype associated to a very high serum type I IFN level and induction of anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes in PBMC. Conversely, hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 display very low frequency of circulating pDC with an inflammatory phenotype and high levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. This study further shed light on the early events resulting from the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells occurring in vitro and confirmed ex vivo. These observations can improve our understanding on the contribution of pDC/type I IFN axis in the regulation of the anti-viral state in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients. Author summary SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections and deaths worldwide, yet the role of host innate immune responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains only partially characterized. Innate immunity represents the first line of host defense against viruses. Upon viral recognition, the secretion of type I and III interferons (IFN) establishes the cellular state of viral resistance, and contributes to induce the specific adaptive immune responses. Moving from in vitro evidences on the protective role played by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC)-released type I IFN in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we characterized ex vivo the pDC phenotype and the balance between anti-viral and pro-inflammatory cytokines of COVID-19 patients stratified according to disease severity. Our study confirms in COVID-19 the crucial and protective role of pDC/type I IFN axis, whose deeper understanding may contribute to the development of novel pharmacological strategies and/or host-directed therapies aimed at boosting pDC response since the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Differential plasmacytoid dendritic cell phenotype and type I Interferon response in asymptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM This study aimed to delineate the impact of posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) on regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) in preterm infants before and after ventricular decompression using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). METHODS rcSO2 values were recorded, fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated, cerebral ultrasound scans were performed, and resistive indices and ventricular width were collected before and after decompression. Where possible, amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded before and after decompression. RESULTS We included nine preterm infants: nine with cranial ultrasound scan data, eight with NIRS data, seven with aEEG data and four with VEPs. The resistive index was stable and remained unchanged after decompression in all patients. Before decompression, the mean rcSO2 value was 42.6  12.9% and increased to 55  12.2% after decompression. With increasing ventricular width, FTOE showed a mean value of 0.51  0.05 and decreased to a mean of 0.39  0.12 after decompression.

Older people, who form a high-risk group, have a stronger tendency for anxiety and cautious attitudes toward COVID-19, and they more frequently implement preventive behaviors. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of implementation of behaviors is determined not only by anxiety, cautious attitude, risk of aggravation to oneself, and perceived effectiveness of behaviors but also by regret, altruism, and conformity.

Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals. Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to find out the association of ABO blood groups with the severity and outcome of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children.

In adults, the virus causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while in children the disease seems to be milder, although a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) has been described. The aim was to describe and compare the characteristics of the severe COVID-19 disease in adults and children. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included the young adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March-June 2020 and admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. The two populations were analysed and compared focusing on their clinical and analytical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. There were 16 adults (80%) and 4 children (20%). No mortality was recorded. All the adults were admitted due to ARDS. The median age was 32 years (IQR 23.3-41.5) and the most relevant previous pathology was obesity (n = 7, 43.7%). Thirteen (81.3%) needed mechanical ventilation, with a median PEEP of 13 (IQR 10.5-14.5). Six (37.5%) needed inotropic support due to the sedation. Eight (50%) developed a healthcare-associated infection, the most frequent of which was central line-associated bloodstream infection (n = 7, 71.4%). One patient developed a partial pulmonary thromboembolism, despite him being treated with heparin. All the children were admitted due to MIS-C. Two (50%) required mechanical ventilation. All needed inotropic support, with a median vasoactive-inotropic score of 27.5 (IQR 17.5-30). The difference in the inotropic requirements between the two populations was statistically significant (37.5% vs. 100%, p < 0.001). The biomarker values were higher in children than in adults: mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin 1.72 vs. 0.78 nmol/L (p = 0.017), procalcitonin 5.7 vs. 0.19 ng/mL (p = 0.023), and C-reactive protein 328.2 vs. 146.9 mg/L (p = 0.005). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponins were higher in children than in adults (p = 0.034 and p = 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adults and children had different clinical manifestations. Adults developed severe ARDS requiring increased respiratory support, whereas children presented MIS-C with greater inotropic requirements.

Head-to-head comparisons of such assays using a single set of standard specimens provide additional information about key assay parameters such as sensitivity, specificity and lower limits of detection, and help to inform the decision regarding which method to use. We evaluated two real-time PCR platforms: the Fast-track Diagnostics? (FTD) multiplex respiratory panel and a TaqMan array card (TAC) for simultaneous uniplex detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. Two sets of samples were used to evaluate the assays. One set was created by spiking pooled nasal wash or phosphate buffered saline with specified volumes of known concentrations of virus and/or bacteria. Clinical nasal wash specimens from children with lower respiratory tract illness comprised the other set. Thirteen pathogen targets were compared between the two platforms. Testing with a validation panel of spiked samples revealed a sensitivity of 96.1% and 92.9% for the FTD and TAC assays, respectively. Specificity could not be reliably calculated due to a suspected contamination of the sample substrate. Inter-assay agreement was high (> 95%) for most targets. Previously untested clinical specimens tested by both assays revealed a high percent agreement (> 95%) for all except rhinovirus, enterovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Limitations of this evaluation included extraction of the validation samples by two different methods and the evaluation of the assays in different laboratories. However, neither of these factors significantly impacted inter-assay agreement for these sets of samples, and it was demonstrated that both assays could reliably detect clinically relevant concentrations of bacterial and viral pathogens.","output":"Evaluation of fast-track diagnostics and TaqMan array card real-time PCR assays for the detection of respiratory pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Filipino Abstract: Nang magsimula ang pandaidigang pandemya ng COVID-19 sa Japan, marami ang pumuri sa polisiya ng pamahalaan dahil hindi masyadong naapektuhan ang karaniwang pamumuhay at hindi rin mataas ang bilang ng mga tinamaan ng sakit sa bansa kahit na walang malawakang lockdown.

Daily life was not drastically affected, and infections were kept at bay without a national lockdown policy. However, there were also criticisms on how the country handled its border policies, health programs, the slow vaccination roll-out, and the adequacy of the support it provided its residents. How did Filipinos in Japan experience these issues during the pandemic, especially since they are far from their families in the Philippines? This study represents the narratives of anxiety, traveling, staying, and delays by Filipinos in Japan during the pandemic. Through interviews with Filipino students and workers in Japan, this study finds that while the pandemic challenged their mental health, their resilience remained. Despite having to set aside many of their personal goals, their hopes of achieving them remain in the future.","output":"Pangamba at antala sa harap ng pandemya: Mga karanasan ng paglalakbay at pananatili ng mga Pilipino sa Japan (Worries, delays, and the pandemic: Filipino experiences of staying in and traveling to Japan)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the COVID-19 infection speeding around the world, many experience fear and anxiety. To detect those at risk of psychopathology and provide treatment, valid instruments are needed. The aim of this study was to cross-culturally validate the theory-based instrument Multidimensional Assessment of COVID-19-Related Fears (MAC-RF) in Croatian and to further examine the scale's validity by exploring its relationship with relevant constructs. Method: A total of 477 participants completed an online survey during a rapid rise in new daily COVID-19 cases in Croatia and while new restrictions were being imposed. Results: MAC-RF had a stronger association with health anxiety, cyberchondria, and anxiety sensitivity compared to depression, attesting to its convergent and divergent validity. However, a 2-factor structure was revealed in this sample: Fear of infection and Fear of using an inadequate strategy in dealing with pandemic. Fear of infection had a stronger association with health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety and was a better predictor of COVID-19 related protective health behaviors. Fear of choosing an inadequate strategy had a stronger association with cyberchondria, fear of consequences of the epidemic on mental health, as well as financial consequences, and loss of civil liberties. Conclusion: Fear of infection captures negative emotional states due to feared consequences on personal somatic health and the health of loved ones, while Fear of choosing an inadequate strategy in dealing with the pandemic reflects a metacognitive aspect.

Throughout the pandemic, international travel has been a highly contested subject at both the international and national levels. We examined Canadian media reporting on international travel restrictions during the pandemic, how these restrictions aligned with the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), and how the narrative around international travel evolved over time. METHODS: We analysed articles from Canada's top three national newspapers by circulation - The Globe and Mail, The National Post and The Toronto Star - published between Jan 1, 2020 - May 31, 2020. Our search yielded a total of 378 articles across the three newspapers. After removing duplicates and screening the remaining articles, we included a total of 62 articles for the analysis. We conducted a qualitative media content analysis by using an inductive coding approach. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified within the articles. These included: 1) The role of scientific and expert evidence in implementing travel restrictions; 2) Federal legislation, regulation and enforcement of international travel measures; and 3) Compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in travel restriction policy- and decision-making. The federal government relied primarily on scientific evidence for implementing international travel restrictions and fully exercised its powers under the Quarantine Act to enforce travel regulations and comply with the IHR 2005. The government embraced a rules-based international order by following WHO recommendations on international travel, contributing to a delay in border closure and travel restrictions until mid-March. CONCLUSION: The media focussed significantly on international travel-related issues during the early phase of the pandemic. The dominant media narrative surrounded the need for earlier travel restrictions against international travel.","output":"Canada's response to international travel during COVID-19 pandemic - a media analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented conditions for overall health care systems by restricting resources for non-COVID-19 patients.

Ethnic minority populations in the United Kingdom are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with a higher death rate and poorer physical and mental health outcomes. It is important that healthcare organisations consider the specific context and mental, as well as physical, health needs of an ethnically diverse healthcare workforce in order to better support them during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We undertook a qualitative work package as part of the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes among healthcare workers (UK-REACH). As part of the qualitative research, we conducted focus group discussions with healthcare workers between December 2020 and July 2021, and covered topics such as their experiences, fears and concerns, and perceptions about safety and protection, while working during the pandemic. The purposive sample included ancillary health workers, doctors, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. We conducted discussions using Microsoft Teams. Recordings were transcribed and thematically analysed. Findings: We carried out 16 focus groups with a total of 61 participants. Several factors were identified which contributed to, and potentially exacerbated, the poor mental health of ethnic minority healthcare workers during this period including anxiety (due to inconsistent protocols and policy); fear (of infection); trauma (due to increased exposure to severe illness and death); guilt (of potentially infecting loved ones); and stress (due to longer working hours and increased workload). Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. We identified a number of factors which may be contributing to a deterioration in mental health across diverse ethnic groups. Healthcare organisations should consider developing strategies to counter the negative impact of these factors. This paper will help employers of healthcare workers and other relevant policy makers better understand the wider implications and potential risks of COVID-19 and assist in developing strategies to safeguard the mental health of these healthcare workers going forward, and reduce ethnic disparities.","output":"Mental Health During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study with Ethnically Diverse Healthcare Workers in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present an algorithm to decide the equivalence of context-free session types, practical to the point of being incorporated in a compiler.

Its rapid global spread has resulted in a major public health emergency, necessitating commensurately rapid research to improve control strategies. In particular, the ability to effectively retrace transmission chains in outbreaks remains a major challenge, partly due to our limited understanding of the virus' underlying evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts. We used high-throughput sequencing whole-genome data coupled with bottleneck analysis to retrace the pathways of viral transmission in two nosocomial outbreaks that were previously characterised by epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressures, and diversity at the within-host level for both outbreaks. Our findings show evidence of within-host selection and transmission of variants between samples. Both bottleneck and diversity analyses highlight within-host and consensus-level variants shared by putative source-recipient pairs in both outbreaks, suggesting that certain within-host variants in these outbreaks may have been transmitted upon infection rather than arising de novo independently within multiple hosts. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of combining within-host diversity and bottleneck estimations for elucidating transmission events in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, provide insight into the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, provide a list of candidate targets of positive selection for further investigation, and demonstrate that within-host variants can be transferred between patients.

Social support specific to PA (SSPA) had been highlighted as an important psychosocial factor in initiating and/or maintaining active behavior. The main aims of this study were to explore the influence of COVID-19 lockdown on PA and sedentary behavior, and on SSPA from family and from friends; and investigate the potential differences in terms of professional status. An online survey was distributed during the 1st weeks of the lockdown. A total of 272 Belgian adults responded to the survey. The findings show no significant difference between prior to and during lockdown with regard to the amount of PA. The results show a significant increase in sedentary behavior among the entire sample, workers and retirees. The findings also suggest that the support of other individuals is particularly useful for certain population groups such as retirees.

Insulin resistance (IR) has been linked to inflammatory states. The aim of this study was to determine whether IR is increased in a cohort of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with low disease activity. We additionally intended to establish which factors were the determinants of IR in this population, including the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods. Cross-sectional study encompassing 151 IBD patients and 174 non-diabetic controls. Insulin and C-peptide serum levels and IR and beta cell function (%B) indices based on homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA2) were assessed in patients and controls. Liver stiffness as measured by transient elastography, and the presence of NAFLD detected via ultrasound were additionally assessed. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to evaluate the differences in IR indexes between patients and controls, and to determine which predictor factors were associated with IR in IBD patients. Results. Neither HOMA2-IR (beta coef. ?0.26 {95%CI ?0.64C0.13}, p = 0.19) nor HOMA2-%B (beta coef. 15 {95%CI ?14C44}, p = 0.31) indexes differed between patients and controls after fully multivariable analysis. Among classic IR risk factors, obesity, abdominal circumference, and triglycerides significantly and positively correlated with IR indexes in IBD patients. However, most features related to IBD, such as disease patterns, disease activity, and inflammatory markers, were not associated with IR. The presence of NAFLD was independently and significantly associated with beta cell dysfunction in patients with IBD (HOMA2B grade 4, 251  40 vs. grade 1, 107  37, p = <0.001). Conclusions.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have difficulty in visiting clinics in person during pandemic because they might be encouraged to quarantine at home with supportive care. Peritonsillar abscess rarely coexists with COVID-19; however, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could get co-infections or become superinfected with other microorganisms which could cause peritonsillar abscess. We herein describe a case of peritonsillar abscess caused by Prevotella bivia that occurred as a co-infection with COVID-19 during home quarantine. PATIENT CONCERNS A 32-year-old Asian woman who was diagnosed with COVID-19 was instructed to stay home for quarantine. Her pharyngeal discomfort worsened, and she experienced trismus and dysphagia. An emergent visiting doctor referred her to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed peritonsillar abscess findings, following which we referred her to an ear, nose, throat specialist. Prevotella bivia was identified on needle aspiration pus culture; however, two sets of blood and throat cultures were negative. DIAGNOSIS A definitive diagnosis of acute COVID-19 and peritonsillar abscess due to Prevotella bivia was made. INTERVENTIONS An antibiotic drug, antiviral drug, and adjunctive steroid were administered intravenously. OUTCOMES Her symptoms improved without the need for incision and drainage, and she was discharged on day 7. CONCLUSION Patients with suspected peritonsillar abscess should be triaged and referred to ear, nose, throat specialists appropriately. Scoring systems, such as modified Liverpool peritonsillar abscess score or the guidelines criteria might be useful tools to triage patients. During the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, administration of corticosteroids is not recommended. When adjunctive steroids are considered for peritonsillar abscess, prior to or simultaneous use of the antiviral agent remdesivir for COVID-19 might be recommended.","output":"Peritonsillar abscess caused by Prevotella bivia during home quarantine for coronavirus disease 2019: Case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nature connection, which describes a positive relationship between humans and the rest of nature, has been recognised as a worthwhile goal of all education.

Although computational docking of ligands to targets has been used to augment the empirical discovery process, its historical effectiveness has been limited because of the poor correlation of ligand dock scores and experimentally determined binding constants. Recent progress in super-computing, coupled to theoretical insights, allows the calculation of the Gibbs free energy, and therefore accurate binding constants, for usually large ligandCreceptor systems.

Based on a large-scale panel survey (N = 22,696) on the social impact of COVID-19, this article firstly examines which social groups are most susceptible to the mental health consequences of the pandemic. Secondly, we examine whether social capital provides protection against this impact. We find that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is considerable and that it increased over the course of 2020. Women, young people, respondents with low incomes and/or poor self-perceived health, experience relatively more fear and stress due to the pandemic. We do not find a difference between respondents with or without a migration background. Social capital (received support, trust in people and in institutions) has the expected effect: the more support and trust, the less fear and stress. There is a mediation effect. Older people, respondents with high incomes and/or good health experience less fear and stress, partly because they have more social capital. This is different for females. They would experience even more fear and stress, compared to men, were it not for the fact that they have more social capital. Hence we conclude that social capital indeed provides some protection against the negative mental health consequences of COVID-19.","output":"Social Capital as Protection Against the Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To warrant potential clinical testing, the equine anti-SARSCCoV F(ab)(2) requires evaluation in as many animal models as possible and a safety test in a primate model.

Hyperglycemia occurring in the setting of either previously diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes is known to be associated with poor outcomes. Here, we aim to provide a simple and practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in admitted patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The guidance is formulated based on experience of authors and relevant literature on the subject searched using Pubmed. RESULTS: Every patient admitted to a COVID care facility should be investigated for hyperglycemia using a combination of tests including capillary blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral glucose lowering drugs can be considered in patients with mild COVID illness who have mild hyperglycemia (pre-meal blood glucose of 180 mg/dl and post-meal blood glucose of 250 mg/dl) and no contraindication to the use of these agents. All patients with moderate-severe disease and/or hyperglycemia of greater severity should be initiated on insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively screened for and managed in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids. CONCLUSION: This document provides a broad overview on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia at COVID care facilities and should be useful to a wide range of healthcare personnel involved in care of patients with COVID-19.","output":"A guidance on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia at COVID care facilities in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES With the continuous generation of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pressure of epidemic prevention and control continues to increase in China. Omicron with stronger infectiousness, immune escape ability and repeated infection ability spread to many countries and regions around the world in a short period of time. China has also successively reported cases of imported Omicron infections. This study aims to understand the epidemiological characteristics of Omicron variant via analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of imported patients with Omicron in Hunan Province, and to provide reference for preventing and controlling the imported epidemics. METHODS The clinical data of imported patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to Hunan Province from December 16 to December 31, 2021 were retrospectively collected. The epidemiological information, general information, clinical classification, clinical symptoms, vaccination status, and lung CT were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were collected. Virus nucleic acid was detected by magnetic beads method using SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. Ct values of ORF1ab gene and N gene were compared between asymptomatic infected patients and confirmed patients. The specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence assay using SARS-CoV-2 IgM test kit and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test kit, respectively. Ct values of IgM and IgG antibodies were compared between asymptomatic infected patients and confirmed patients. RESULTS Seventeen patients with Omicron variant infection were treated in Hunan, including 15 confirmed patients (5 common type and 10 mild type) and 2 asymptomatic infection patients. The 17 patients were all Chinese, they were generally young, and 16 were male. There were 9 patients with diseases. Of them 3 patients had respiratory diseases. All 17 patients had completed the whole process of vaccination, but only one person received a booster shot of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The clinical manifestations of the patients were mild, mainly including dry/painful/itchy throat, cough, and fatigue. The total protein and creatine in the asymptomatic infection and confirmed cases infected with Omicron variant were all within the normal range, but other biochemical indicators were abnormal. There were the significant differences in C-reactive protein and fibrinogen between asymptomatic infection and confirmed patients (both P<0.05). There were more patients with elevated C-reactive protein in confirmed patients than without confirmed ones. The detection rate of specific IgM and IgG antibodies on admission was 100%, and there was no significant difference in the specific antibody levels between asymptomatic infection and confirmed patients (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in Ct values of ORF1ab gene and N gene (21.35 and 18.39 vs 19.22 and 15.67) between the asymptomatic infection and the confirmed patients (both P>0.05). Only 3 patients had abnormal lung CT, showing a small amount of patchy and cord-like shadows. One of them had no abnormality on admission but had pulmonary lesions and migratory phenomenon after admission. CONCLUSIONS The patients with Omicron variant tend to be young people and have milder clinical symptoms, but the viral load is high and the infectiveness is strong. Therefore, the timely identification and effective isolation and control for asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with mild symptoms are extremely important. In terms of epidemic prevention and control, the government still needs to strengthen the risk control of overseas input, adhere to normalized epidemic prevention and control measures, to effectively control the source of infection, cut off the route of transmission, and protect vulnerable people.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of 17 imported patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phosphor (P) ist eine lebensnotwendige und nicht-substituierbare Ressource fr die landwirtschaftliche Erzeugung.

The primary outcome was a pooled mortality estimate, considering all patients and only hospitalized patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of ICU admission and ventilation in hospitalized patients. Subgroup analyses included mortality stratified by age, treatment status, and malignancy subtype.

This issue led some researchers to cast doubts on the existence of a system able to process numerical information independently from the influence of visual features. In the present study, we sought to shed light on the interplay between numerosity and visual features. To this aim, we implemented a non-symbolic estimation task which included a calibration phase. After performing a pre-calibration block, participants were presented with the calibration image for 20 s, and they were divided in three groups, according to the calibration stimulus they attended to: the three calibration stimuli contained the same number of items (30), but were characterized by a different amount of visual features. Results showed that performance was affected by numerosity and visual features in both phases of the experiment. However, calibration increased the weight of numerosity on performance while decreasing the weight of visual features.

Analyses include observations that positive reframing and active coping (Positive Outlook) were strong predictors of music use in mood regulation amongst listener's coping strategies, as was Substance Use. Higher Age indicated having a negative effect on music's use in mood regulation, whilst factors such as gender were not seen to be significant in relation to the use of music in mood regulation within this context.

This could lead to increased sickness as they can be engaged in tasks other than driving. Adopting different sickness mitigation techniques gives us unique types of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles to be studied. In this paper, we report on a study where we explored the possibilities of assessing motion sickness with electrogastrography (EGG), a non-invasive method used to measure the myoelectric activity of the stomach, and its potential usage in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator with a virtual reality (VR) headset. There separate EGG measurements were performed: before, during and after the driving AV simulation video in VR. During the driving, the participants encountered two driving environments: a straight and less dynamic highway road and a highly dynamic and curvy countryside road. The EGG signal was recorded with a proprietary 3-channel recording device and Ag/AgCl cutaneous electrodes. In addition, participants were asked to signalize whenever they felt uncomfortable and nauseated by pressing a special button. After the drive they completed also the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and reported on their overall subjective perception of sickness symptoms. The EGG results showed a significant increase of the dominant frequency (DF) and the percentage of the high power spectrum density (FSD) as well as a significant decrease of the power spectrum density Crest factor (CF) during the AV simulation. The vast majority of participants reported nausea during more dynamic conditions, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and the RMS value of EGG. Reported nausea occurred simultaneously with the increase in EGG amplitude. Based on the results, we conclude that EGG could be used for assessment of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles. DF, CF and FSD can be used as overall sickness indicators, while the relative increase in amplitude of EGG signal and duration of that increase can be used as short-term sickness indicators where the driving environment may affect the driver.","output":"Electrogastrography in Autonomous Vehicles-An Objective Method for Assessment of Motion Sickness in Simulated Driving Environments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policymakers should treat DIY-biology laboratories as legitimate parts of the scientific enterprise and pay attention to the role of community norms.","output":"Biosafety in DIY-bio laboratories: from hype to policy: Discussions about regulating DIY biology tend to ignore the extent of self-regulation and oversight of DIY laboratories."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic saw the deputation of postgraduate residents all over the country to round the clock COVID duties.

Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V.

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among adults with ESKD treated with in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in the United States. Exposure was ascribed on the basis of the presence or absence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, and separately, a history of documented COVID-19 before study entry. Outcomes were assessed after an infection-free period, and were any SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., detected by protocolized PCR tests or during routine clinical surveillance), and clinically manifest COVID-19 (consisting of only the latter). RESULTS: Of 2337 consented participants who met study inclusion criteria, 9.5% were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive at baseline; 3.6% had a history of COVID-19. Over 6679 patient-months of follow-up, 263 participants had evidence of any SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 141 who had clinically manifest COVID-19.

Training needs to incorporate recent advances in digital peer support and the increase of peer support work roles internationally. There is a lack of evidence on training topics that are important for initial peer support work training and on which training topics can be provided on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to establish consensus levels about the content of initial training for mental health PSWs and the extent to which each identified topic can be delivered over the internet. METHODS: A systematized review was conducted to identify a preliminary list of training topics from existing training manuals. Three rounds of Delphi consultation were then conducted to establish the importance and web-based deliverability of each topic. In round 1, participants were asked to rate the training topics for importance, and the topic list was refined. In rounds 2 and 3, participants were asked to rate each topic for importance and the extent to which they could be delivered over the internet. RESULTS: The systematized review identified 32 training manuals from 14 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were synthesized to develop a preliminary list of 18 topics. The Delphi consultation involved 110 participants (49 PSWs, 36 managers, and 25 researchers) from 21 countries (14 high-income, 5 middle-income, and 2 low-income countries). After the Delphi consultation (round 1: n=110; round 2: n=89; and round 3: n=82), 20 training topics (18 universal and 2 context-specific) were identified. There was a strong consensus about the importance of five topics: lived experience as an asset, ethics, PSW well-being, and PSW role focus on recovery and communication, with a moderate consensus for all other topics apart from the knowledge of mental health. There was no clear pattern of differences among PSW, manager, and researcher ratings of importance or between responses from participants in countries with different resource levels.

There are several valuable lessons have been achieved in different countries this Covid-19 battle. These studies have presented the usefulness of prompt actions in testing, isolating confirmed infectious cases from community as well as social resource planning/optimization through data-driven anticipation. In recent times, many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of short/long-term forecasting in number of new Covid-19 cases in forms of time-series data. These predictions have directly supported to effectively optimize the available healthcare resources as well as imposing suitable policies for slowing down the Covid-19 spreads, especially in high-populated cities/regions/nations. There are several progresses of deep neural architectures, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) have demonstrated significant improvements in analyzing and learning the time-series datasets for conducting better predictions. However, most of recent RNN-based techniques are considered as unable to handle chaotic/non-smooth sequential datasets. The consecutive disturbances and lagged observations from chaotic time-series dataset like as routine Covid-19 confirmed cases have led to the low performance in temporal feature learning process through recent RNN-based models. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a novel dual attention-based sequential auto-encoding architecture, called as: DAttAE. Our proposed model supports to effectively learn and predict the new Covid-19 cases in forms of chaotic and non-smooth time series dataset. Specifically, the integration between dual self-attention mechanism in a given Bi-LSTM based auto-encoder in our proposed model supports to directly focus the model on a specific time-range sequence in order to achieve better prediction. We evaluated the performance of our proposed DAttAE model by comparing with multiple traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning-based techniques for time-series prediction task upon different real-world datasets. Experimental outputs demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed attention-based deep neural approach in comparing with state-of-the-art RNN-based architectures for time series based Covid-19 outbreak prediction task.","output":"Dual attention-based sequential auto-encoder for Covid-19 outbreak forecasting: A case study in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Activation of the innate immune system and natural killer (NK) cells has been a key effort in cancer immunotherapy research.

This sensor allowed for highly sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as PMO does not have charges, leading to low background signal. Not only did the method present a low limit of detection in PBS (0.37 fM), throat swab (2.29 fM), and serum (3.99 fM), but also it achieved a rapid response to COVID-19 patients' samples within 2 min.

During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, Cobb and Douglas Public Health (CDPH), the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH), and CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in eight public elementary schools in a single school district. COVID-19 cases* among educators and students were either self-reported or identified by local public health officials. Close contacts (contacts)? of persons with a COVID-19 case received testing. Among contacts who received positive test results, public health investigators assessed epidemiologic links, probable transmission directionality, and the likelihood of in-school transmission. Nine clusters of three or more epidemiologically linked COVID-19 cases were identified involving 13 educators and 32 students at six of the eight elementary schools. Two clusters involved probable educator-to-educator transmission that was followed by educator-to-student transmission and resulted in approximately one half (15 of 31) of school-associated cases. Sixty-nine household members of persons with school-associated cases were tested, and 18 (26%) received positive results. All nine transmission clusters involved less than ideal physical distancing, and five involved inadequate mask use by students. Educators were central to in-school transmission networks. Multifaceted mitigation measures in schools, including promotion of COVID-19 precautions outside of school, minimizing in-person adult interactions at school, and ensuring universal and correct mask use and physical distancing among educators and students when in-person interaction is unavoidable, are important in preventing in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

The mobility of people and other factors, such as precipitation and irregular inflow of industrial wastewater, are complicating the estimation of the disease prevalence through WBE, which is crucial for proper crisis management. These estimations are particularly challenging in urban areas with moderate or low numbers of inhabitants in situations where movement restrictions are not adopted (as in the case of Latvia) because residents of smaller municipalities tend to be more mobile and less strict in following the rules and measures of disease containment. Thus, population movement can influence the outcome of WBE measurements significantly and may not reflect the actual epidemiological situation in the respective area. Here, we demonstrate that by combining the data of detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) analyses in wastewater and mobile call detail records it was possible to provide an accurate assessment of the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in towns that are small (COVID-19 28-day cumulative incidence r = 0.609 and 35-day cumulative incidence r = 0.89, p < 0.05) and medium-sized towns (COVID-19 21-day cumulative incidence r = 0.997, 28-day cumulative incidence r = 0.98 and 35-day cumulative incidence r = 0.997, p < 0.05).

An understanding of broad-spectrum adaptive immunity, including CD8(+) T cell immunity to wide range of epitopes, could help translational efforts to improve coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and therapy. However, there have been few direct studies in which such immunity exists in a population. Methods: We selected SARS-CoV-2-conserved structural peptides that are not prone to mutation as antigens for broad-spectrum CD8(+) T cell immunity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from unexposed healthy donors were stimulated with these peptides in vitro and CD8(+) T cell-specific response was monitored. The conserved peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells were sorted for T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing. The presence of specific complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) clones was analyzed in a healthy cohort. Results: For each structural protein, including S, E, M, N, the conserved peptides could potentially provide the largest number of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) epitopes in the Oriental and Caucasian populations. For conserved peptides from spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, we found that there were no cross-reactive memory T cells in the unexposed individuals. Instead, their T cells contain na?ve TCR repertoire recognizing these conserved peptides. Using TCR sequencing and CDR3 clustering for the conserved peptides specific T cells, we found that the recovered patients had a higher proportion of TCR repertoire similar with that of specific CD8(+) T cells in unexposed individuals. Meanwhile, CDR3 clones of the above T cells were widely present in the healthy population.

This study evaluated a multidisciplinary approach of supporting PCPs in their management of this psychosocially complex patient population, to inform subsequent strategies clinics can use to support PCPs. METHODS Four years ago, at our academic community health safety-net system, we created a multidisciplinary consultation service to support PCPs in caring for complex patients with pain and addiction. We collected and thematically analyzed 66 referral questions to understand PCPs' initially expressed needs, interviewed 14 referring PCPs to understand their actual needs that became apparent during the consultation, and identified discrepancies between these sets of needs. RESULTS Many of the PCPs' expressed needs aligned with their actual needs, including needing expertise in the areas of addiction, safe prescribing of opioids, nonopioid treatment options, and communication strategies for difficult conversations, a comprehensive review of the case, and a biopsychosocial approach to management. But several PCP needs emerged after the initial consultation that they did not initially anticipate, including confirming their medical decision-making process, emotional validation, feeling more control, having an outside entity take the burden off the PCP for management decisions, boundary setting, and reframing the visit to focus on the patient's function, values, and goals. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary consultation service can act as a mechanism to meet the needs of PCPs caring for psychosocially complex patients with pain and addiction, including unanticipated needs.

METHODS The da Vinci surgical robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) was used on 16 pediatric patients for 18 procedures. A variety of upper airway pathologies and reconstructions in children with a wide range of ages and weights were treated. No lingual tonsillectomies or base-of-tongue reductions were included. RESULTS Sixteen children (6 males) underwent 18 TORS procedures, including resection of hamartoma (n = 1), repair of laryngeal cleft (n = 7), removal of saccular cyst (n = 2), release of pharyngeal or esophageal strictures (n = 2), and excision of lymphatic malformations (n = 4).

RESULTS: HRV and return to baseline (recovery) decreased as resting HR and RR increased (p<0.001) from the early follicular to the late luteal phase of the MC. Patterning was paradoxical across phases for users of combined hormonal contraception (BC) as compared with the patterning of the MC. HRV and recovery start elevated and drop off quickly during the withdrawal bleed, rising through the active pill weeks (p<0.001). Progestin-only users had similar patterning as the MC. The relationship between normalised recovery and previous day strain is modulated by birth control type. BC exhibited steeper declines in recovery with additional strain-normalised recovery decreases by an additional 0.00550.00135 (p<0.001) per unit of strain; with no significant difference between MC and progestin-only (p=0.19). CONCLUSION: The patterning of ANS modulation from ovarian hormones is significantly different between naturally cycling women and those on BC, with the patterning dependent on the type of contraception used.","output":"Patterns of endogenous and exogenous ovarian hormone modulation on recovery metrics across the menstrual cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While severe COVID-19 is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface, responses to asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy remain unknown. Here, we assess immunological adaptations in blood and term decidua in response to asymptomatic/mild disease in pregnant women. We report attenuated antigen presentation and type-I IFN signaling pathways, loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, and upregulated cytokine/chemokine signaling in monocyte-derived decidual macrophages. Furthermore, we describe increased frequencies of activated tissue-resident T-cells and decreased abundance of regulatory T-cells with infection while frequencies of cytotoxic CD4/CD8 T-cells are increased in the blood. In contrast to decidual macrophages, type-I IFN signaling is higher in decidual T-cells. Finally, infection leads to a narrowing of T-cell receptor diversity in both blood and decidua. Collectively, these observations indicate that asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 during pregnancy results in remodeling of the immunological landscape of the maternal-fetal interface, with a potential for long-term adverse outcomes for the offspring.","output":"Single cell RNA sequencing reveals immunological rewiring at the maternal-fetal interface following asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evaluating the patients with COVID\\\\19 following discharge from intensive care unit for pulmonary rehabilitation is crucial.

In contrast, vegetarianism was found not to be a protected philosophical belief in Conisbee v Crossley Farms Limited and others. The authors argue that the Employment Tribunal misunderstood the notion of vegetarianism when deciding that it was a life-style choice. There are different kinds of vegans and vegetarians, each with their own way of practising the philosophy which influences how they live their life. Not all people who follow a meat-free diet should be afforded this protection, and it depends on whether their belief is one which is determined by certain factors, such as animal welfare and environmentalism, rather than for health purposes. The authors explore the arguments and analysis in the above employment cases, coming to the conclusion that the tribunals oversimplified what it means to hold values such as veganism and vegetarianism, failing to understand the differences between different classifications and sub-groups when coming to a decision. The different kinds of vegans and vegetarians and their characteristics are outlined, before determining whether this should constitute protection under employment law, protecting individuals from discrimination. The situation in the USA and Canada regarding this issue is very different, and there are parallels drawn with attempting to establish veganism or vegetarianism as a religion, and where they could benefit from the recent decision in England and Wales. Finally, this paper concludes that ethical and environmental veganism and vegetarianism should both qualify as protected philosophical beliefs, but other kinds may fall short of what is required to satisfy the requirements under law.","output":"A Life-Style Choice or a Philosophical Belief?: The Argument for Veganism and Vegetarianism to be a Protected Philosophical Belief and the Position in England and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, an emerging virus that utilizes host proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as entry factors. Understanding the factors affecting the pattern and levels of expression of these genes is important for deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. We find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 (T2) inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that the interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. IL-13 and virus infection mediated effects on ACE2 expression were also observed at the protein level in the airway epithelium. Finally, we define airway responses to common coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections generate host responses similar to other viral species, including upregulation of IL6 and ACE2.

Additionally, pregnant women with COVID-19 might have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. To investigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women, we performed a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. METHODS: Web of Science, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE- databases were searched for original studies concerning the effect of COVID-19 on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women published by July 10, 2020. Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data and report pooled proportions. RESULTS: 117 studies with a total of 11758 pregnant women were included. The age ranged between 15 and 48 years. Most subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester. Disease severity was not reported in 1125 subjects. Maternal mortality was 1.3%. In 100% of fatal cases with adequate data, fever alone or with cough was one of the presenting symptoms. Also, dyspnea (58.3%) and myalgia (50%) were the most common symptoms. Sore throat (8.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea) (8.3%) were rare. The rate of comorbidities was 20% among COVID-19 deaths. The majority of COVID-19-infected women who died had cesarean section (58.3%), 25% had a vaginal delivery, and 16.7% of patients were not full term. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women was associated with higher rates (and pooled proportions) of cesarean section and mortality. Because new data are continuously being generated and published, the findings of this study can be complete and updated with new researches.

A systematic review of the literature until January 2012 was performed. Publications were assessed for operative techniques, equipment, surgical results, hospital stay, and readmissions. Results. 34 articles, published between 2010 and 2012, were identified reporting on 301 patients with IBD that underwent surgical treatment in SPLS technique. Surgical procedures included ileocolic resections, sigmoid resections, colectomies with end ileostomy or ileorectal anastomosis, and restorative proctocolectomies with ileum-pouch reconstruction. There was a wide variety in the surgical technique and the employed equipment. The overall complication profile was similar to reports on standard laparoscopic surgery in IBD. Conclusions.

We examined gender differences in perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors, healthy behaviours, threat perceptions and emotional responses, as well as the role of gender as a moderating factor. RESULTS: Women reported higher levels of precautionary behaviour (t(475)=3.91, p<0.001) and more negative emotional reactions toward COVID-19 (t(475)=6.07, p<0.001). No gender differences emerged in perceived susceptibility or knowledge about COVID-19. The multiple regression model is significant and explains 30% of the variance in precautionary behaviour, which was found to be higher among women and older participants, those with higher perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors and those with higher emotional reactions.

To explore the mechanism, we show that both human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-derived CMs) and adult cardiomyocytes (CMs) can be productively infected by SARS-CoV-2, leading to secretion of the monocyte chemoattractant cytokine CCL2 and subsequent monocyte recruitment. Increased CCL2 expression and monocyte infiltration was also observed in the hearts of infected hamsters.

DESIGN: Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared with a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4?7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations, measured using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody assay 3-10 weeks after vaccination, in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates (defined by a cut-off of 15 U/mL), and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. RESULTS: Geometric mean (SD) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL (5.9) vs 28.8 U/mL (5.4) p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL (4.9)) vs 13.8 U/mL (5.9) p<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab-treated compared with vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change (FC) 0.29 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.40), p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.51), p<0.0001) vaccines.

This study deals with the investigation of the composition, cytotoxicity, and anti-Zika activity of Punica granatum leaf ethanolic extract, fractions, and phytoconstituents. P. granatum leaves were collected from different areas in Italy and Greece in different seasons. Crude extracts were analyzed and fractionated, and the pure compounds were isolated. The phytochemical and biomolecular fingerprint of the pomegranate leaves was determined. The antiviral activities of the leaf extract, fractions, and compounds were investigated against the MR766 and HPF2013 Zika virus strains in vitro. Both the extract and its fractions were found to be active against Zika virus infection. Of the compounds isolated, ellagic acid showed particular anti-Zika activities, with EC50 values of 30.86 M for MR766 and 46.23 M for HPF2013. The mechanism of action was investigated using specific antiviral assays, and it was demonstrated that ellagic acid was primarily active as it prevented Zika virus infection and was able to significantly reduce Zika virus progeny production. Our data demonstrate the anti-Zika activity of pomegranate leaf extract and ellagic acid for the first time.

METHODS: Infants <1500 g were stratified into four groups depending on intubation status through first 3 days of life. The incidence of mortality, CLD and other morbidities were compared over four chronological epochs. Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). RESULTS: Of 773 infants (median GA = 28 weeks, average BW = 995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p < 0.001).

Cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), the mouse analog of LL-37 peptide in humans, is a cationic antimicrobial peptide belonging to the cathelicidin family; however, its secretion by cancer cells and role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear. In this study, we explored the possibility of an interaction between effector CD4+ T cells and CRAMP using in vitro-generated mouse Th17 cells. We found that CRAMP stimulates Th17 cells to express the ectonucleotidase CD73, while simultaneously inducing cell death. This finding suggested that CD73-expressing Th17 cells may function as immune suppressor cells instead of effector cells. In addition, treatment of pharmacological inhibitors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) signaling pathway showed that induction of CD73 expression is mediated by the p38 signaling pathway. Overall, our findings suggest that tumor-derived LL-37 likely functions as an immune suppressor that induces immune tolerance against tumors through shaping effector Th17 cells into suppressor Th17 cells, suggesting a new intervention target to improve cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Cathelicidin-Related Antimicrobial Peptide Regulates CD73 Expression in Mouse Th17 Cells via p38"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The concerns of the highly contagious and morbid nature of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-2019) have prompted healthcare workers to implement strict droplet and contact isolation precautions.

Findings were compared between patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS and those in whom SARS was excluded by laboratory or public health investigation. Of 364 cases, 273 (75%) had confirmed SARS, 30 (8%) were excluded, and 61 (17%) remained indeterminate. Among confirmed cases, exposure occurred in the healthcare environment (80%) or in the households of affected patients (17%); community or travel-related cases were rare (<3%). Fever occurred in 97% of patients by the time of admission. Respiratory findings including cough, dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates evolved later and were present in only 59, 37 and 68% of patients, respectively, at admission. Direct exposure, fever on the first day of illness, and elevated temperature, pulmonary infiltrates, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia at admission were associated with confirmed cases. Rhinorrhea, sore throat, and an elevated neutrophil count at admission were associated with excluded cases. In the absence of fever or significant exposure, SARS is unlikely.

The infection by RNA virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV, from beta class of corona viruses has been found to be responsible for COVID-19. Structural analysis and evidences have been indicated that interaction between a segment of receptor binding domain (RBD) from S protein of virus and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is essential for cellular entry of virus. OBJECTIVE: The current review put the light on structural aspects for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction mediated cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues. RESULTS: Recently, several studies are being conducted for inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the human cellular system. One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, published reports pointed out Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain of ACE2 as crucial residues for mimicking and design of novel molecules as inhibitors SARS-CoV-2 attachment to human cells. Moreover, some recently identified RBD-hACE2 interaction inhibitors have also been described with their protein binding pattern and potencies (IC50 values) which will help for further improvement in the selectivity.","output":"Inhibition of S-protein RBD and hACE2 Interaction for Control of SARSCoV-2 Infection (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it, innumerable challenges in healthcare, both through the direct burden of morbidity and mortality of the disease, and also by the curtailing of other essential albeit less emergency medical services to reduce the risk of community spread.

Over 85% of patients with COVID-19 in China used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and a most common herb is Glycyrrhiza glabra, which in vitro inhibits replication of different enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin in vitro connects and changes conformation of ACE2 receptors, which are vital for SARS-CoV-2 penetration into host cells. Pelargonium sidoides show immunomodulatory and antiviral properties in clinical and in vitro studies, and it inhibits replication of HCo-229E coronavirus. Glycyrrhiza glabra in combination with standard therapies significantly reduces the hospitalization rate and occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. As complementary therapies lianhuaqingwen capsules and jinhua qinggan granules reduces hospitalization rates, time to symptoms recovery and improve patient psychological comfort. In view of SARS-CoV-2 other herbs are not effective, e.g. maxingshiganCyinqiaosan, or therapeutic concentration would be impossible to achieve, e.g. ephedra herb, or there is simply no proper data.

HCWs eligible for vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA) in December 2020 were invited to receive immunization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of acceptance. Reasons for refusal among those who never intended to be vaccinated (ie, firm refusers) and those who preferred delaying vaccination (ie, vaccine hesitants) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 2,761 respondents (72% female, average age, 44), 2,233 (80.9%) accepted the vaccine. Physicians, environmental services workers and healthcare managers were more likely to accept vaccination compared to nurses. Male sex, age over 50, rehabilitation center workers, and occupational COVID-19 exposure were independently associated with vaccine acceptance by multivariate analysis. Factors for refusal included vaccine novelty, wanting others to receive it first, and insufficient time for decision-making. Among those who declined, 74% reported they may accept future vaccination.

There has been minimal study of mesh incorporation and interface strength with adhesive fixation for ventral hernia repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fixation properties of fibrin glue as it compared to suture fixation of mesh in an onlay position. METHODS Twenty-four mongrel pigs were divided into three study arms based on time points for biomechanical evaluation: 24 h (n = 8), 7 days (n = 8), and 14 days (n = 8). Initial procedures included placement of two 4  6 cm pieces of wide-pore polypropylene mesh in an onlay position. One was fixated with 4 ml of fibrin glue and the other with four interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures. The shear strength of fixation was evaluated using a uniaxial testing device along with histological evaluation. Maximum force was normalized by the width of the mesh. RESULTS Mesh-tissue interface of glued and sutured specimens at 7 and 14 days did not fail in our testing configuration. Only at the 24-h time point the mesh detached from the tissue, and the sutured interface (10.4 N/cm) was significantly stronger than glued interface (4.9 N/cm, p = 0.004). Histopathologic and gross evaluations of the specimens revealed similar histologic features at all time points for both glued and sutured specimens. CONCLUSIONS With mesh in the onlay position, fixation to the abdominal wall occurs quickly. Though sutures were stronger at 24 h, as early as 1 week, the strength of the fixation exceeded the tissue or the mesh strength in our testing configuration for both glue and suture groups. Fixation strength is independent of technique at the latter time points.

It is unclear whether obesity increases the risks of complications and mortality in Hispanic population from COVID-19 disease. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 2020 and August 2020. 950 patients were tested and admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were categorized into classes of body habitus by BMI: underweight (< 18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25.0-29.9), obesity class 1 (30.0-34.9), obesity class 2 (35.0-39.9), and obesity class 3 ( >40.0). Results 950 Hispanic patients were included (Male-52.8%, Female- 47.2%) in the study.

However, there is uncertainty to which extent modern intensified therapies targeting plasma cell features might attenuate vaccination responses; some early vaccination recommendations for MM have proposed extended treatment breaks of several weeks to maximise vaccination success. Such an approach can be challenging in UHiR MM and pPCL, where maintaining treatment intensity is hallmark for preventing rapid relapse of the aggressive tumor. To address this uncertainty, we measured post-vaccination serological responses in patients treated uniformly with intensified Dara-VR consolidation and Dara-R maintenance post-ASCT for UHiR NDMM or pPCL in the UK OPTIMUM/MUKnine trial (NCT03188172). Methods: Between Sep 2017 and Jul 2019, 107 patients with UHiR NDMM or pPCL were recruited to OPTIMUM and received intensified post-ASCT consolidation with Dara-VR(d) for 18 cycles followed by maintenance with Dara-R until progression.

As per UK national guidance and local availability, patients received two vaccine doses 12 weeks apart of either tozinameran (Pfizer/Biontech) or vaxzevria (AstraZeneca); serum taken at least 3 weeks after patients received their second dose was analyzed. Results were correlated with baseline characteristics and annotated with treatment and response data.

At time of second vaccine dose, 55% of patients were receiving Dara-VR consolidation treatment and 45% Dara-R maintenance. There was no recommendation to pause trial treatment for purposes of vaccination and no extended times off treatment for this reason were reported. Overall, 72.5% of patients had a positive vaccine antibody level as per manufacturer cut-point for high specificity evidence of antigen exposure (infection or vaccine). The response rate was nominally higher for vaxzevria (91.3%) than for tozinameran (47.1%), a dysbalance that will be further investigated with ongoing extension of the cohort. Of note, 90% of patients analyzed had reached a complete response (CR) of their MM prior to being vaccinated, and the majority of patients not in CR had a positive vaccine response. Response rates were nominally slightly higher in patients in receipt of Dara-R maintenance at time of second dose with 77.8% compared to Dara-VR consolidation with 68.2%. Conclusions: These results show a high serological response rate to COVID-19 vaccination in UHiR MM patients receiving intensified post-ASCT consolidation and maintenance therapy in remission. Findings suggest that continuation of intensified post-ASCT therapy for patients with aggressive tumors and a high risk of relapse are compatible with serological responses to commonly used COVID-19 vaccines.

Different mortality rates of AKI due to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, based on the degree of organic dysfunction and varying from public to private hospitals. However, there is a lack of data about AKI among critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 424 critically ill adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and AKI, both associated with SARS-CoV-2, admitted to six public ICUs in Brazil. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for AKI severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The average age was 66.42  13.79 years, 90.3% were on mechanical ventilation (MV), 76.6% were at KDIGO stage 3, and 79% underwent hemodialysis. The overall mortality was 90.1%. We found a higher frequency of dialysis (82.7% versus 45.2%), MV (95% versus 47.6%), vasopressors (81.2% versus 35.7%) (p < 0.001) and severe AKI (79.3% versus 52.4%; p = 0.002) in nonsurvivors. MV, vasopressors, dialysis, sepsis-associated AKI, and death (p < 0.001) were more frequent in KDIGO 3. Logistic regression for death demonstrated an association with MV (OR = 8.44; CI 3.43C20.74) and vasopressors (OR = 2.93; CI 1.28C6.71; p < 0.001). Severe AKI and dialysis need were not independent risk factors for death.

While most had had experience with remote learning, the unexpected and immediate transition was challenging. Students and educators who had chosen in-person instruction had to adapt quickly to a learning paradigm for which they had not planned, while simultaneously coping with the anxieties brought on by the pandemic, such as economic hardships, threat of illness, and new family responsibilities. The pandemic has engendered fear, trauma, grief, and loss, all of which negatively affect instruction and learning. This reflection paper identifies special challenges and issues with regard to teaching and learning in social work clinical practice courses brought on by the pandemic. Utilizing the theoretical frameworks of ambiguous loss, interpersonal neurobiology, and the here and now approach, this paper suggests effective teaching methods and collaborative learning strategies to inform social work education during academic disruption in this and future emergencies (e.g., natural disasters). It is suggested that social presence, as well as group cohesion among students and between students and instructors, can serve as a protective factor to ensure continued productive motivation for teaching and learning while facing the challenges that are experienced during such times.","output":"A Reflection on Special Challenges and Amending Pedagogy in Clinical Social Work Practice Courses During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Diagnostic evaluation of otologic diseases often requires otoscopy to visualize the tympanic membrane. The fundamentals of otoscopy include both learning the mechanics of using an otoscope and accurately identifying ear pathologies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was limited peer-to-peer physical exam practice for preclinical medical students. We developed a low-cost 3D-printed otoscopy simulator to teach the otoscopic exam to small groups of medical students. Methods: : A modified open-source 3-dimensional (3D) head was printed, and a silicone ear was attached. A user interface was created to display one normal tympanic membrane and four pathologies. Preclinical medical students attended a didactic lecture on common otologic pathologies and on how to perform otoscopy. Students then practiced otoscopy and pathology identification on the simulator in small groups. After the session, students were provided an optional survey to evaluate their confidence in otoscopy skills and pathology identification. Results: : A total of 47 out of 134 (35%) medical students completed the survey, of whom 60% reported that training with the 3D printed otoscopy simulator was at least moderately effective in learning the mechanical techniques of otoscopy, and 66% found the simulator to be at least moderately effective in helping them learn to identify pathology. The majority (57%) of students reported that the otoscopy simulator was more effective than practicing otoscopy on their peers.

In the case of specific populations, such as students and instructors, the change in the teaching-learning model has required both groups to adapt to online learning platforms and modify all academic activities in the context of implementing the emergency remote education model. The relevance of mental health has been continually neglected;however, due to the COVID-19 epidemiological outbreak, the impact of confinement on populations mental health has been incorporated into public discussion. In particular, the health emergencys impact on health workers in the first line of care has been highlighted. The effect of mental health on the lockdown population and those encouraged to work from home, a group in which university professors and students are located, has been emphasized. To understand the changes faced by higher education instructors and students, derived from the implementation of the emergency remote teaching model in the context of the pandemic, we developed a study to investigate the experiences of this sector, with particular emphasis on the mental health stressors associated with their academic activities. We examined indicators related to anxiety, depression, motivation-demotivation, coping, and contextual and family conditions that could generate stress in the teaching-learning process during the emergency remote teaching model. We recruited a sample of 1,040 participants (380 instructors and 660 students) from more than 97 universities and 118 academic programs across the country. As a result, we have found that teachers have faced less difficulty with the teaching-learning model changes and how they deal with confinement.

Methods This study was conducted on 217 COVID-19 patients admitted to ProMedica Health System Hospitals in Northwest Ohio from March 25 to June 16, 2020. We collected data, including clinical signs, symptoms, and outcomes of the COVID-19 patients. We compared clinical signs and symptoms along with comorbidities of survivors and non-survivors. Results Of the 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Common presenting symptoms were chest pain (91.71%), shortness of breath (79.7%), cough (71%), and fever (64%).

However, the small sample size of infected patients enrolled in most studies did not allow to draw robust conclusions on the COVID-19 impact in PD. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether the prevalence and outcome of COVID-19 in PD patients are different from those observed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting data on PD patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (PD-COVID+). We extracted prevalence, clinical-demographic data, outcome, and mortality. We also analyzed risk or protective factors based on comparisons between PD-COVID+ and control populations with PD without COVID-19 or without PD with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included 16 studies reporting on a total of 11,325 PD patients, 1,061 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median infection prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 8.5%. PD-COVID+ patients had a median age of 74 and a disease duration of 9.4 years. Pooling all PD-COVID+ patients from included studies, 28.6% required hospitalization, 37.1% required levodopa dose increasing, and 18.9% died. The case fatality was higher in PD-COVID+ patients than the general population, with longer PD duration as a possible risk factor for worse outcome. Amantadine and vitamin D were proposed as potential protective factors. CONCLUSION: Available studies indicate a higher case fatality in PD patients affected by COVID-19 than the general population.

RESULTS: In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (p < .001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (p < .001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent - required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department - than in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to Vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Comparing to the preceding 10 years, there arent significant differences in the of number of patients who had urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. CONCLUSION: Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgery when comparing to the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures.","output":"Is there an impact of COVID-19 in Vascular Surgery patients admission to the Emergency department?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of global health, including efforts to curb harmful drinking. Very little is known about the effects of a prolonged disaster like this pandemic on alcohol consumption, misuse, and related harms, and on ongoing interventions designed to prevent or mitigate these harms. Methods: We collected information from key informants in community coalitions in each of five City Pilots funded by the AB InBev Foundation that are implementing prevention and early intervention strategies to reduce harmful drinking. Key informants reported how the pandemic has affected alcohol sales and consumption in their communities, as well as alcohol-related harms such as interpersonal violence and drink driving. Results: We found that alcohol production has slowed and that sales of alcohol have uniformly decreased. However, the effects of local regulations on alcohol sales in on- and off-premise establishments have been uneven. Early reports suggest that home-based drinking has decreased during the pandemic, binge drinking is still problematic, and that while the prevalence of drink driving is greatly reduced, domestic violence has increased. We also report measures taken by the AB InBev Foundation to support the City Pilots efforts to combat the pandemic, which include transitioning in-person prevention strategies to online delivery where feasible, and the reorientation of the AB InBev Foundations Community Fund to support local efforts to combat the pandemic. Conclusions: While it presents considerable challenges for ongoing prevention efforts that depend on interpersonal contact, the Community Fund appeared to have a positive effect on building community coalitions, bringing new stakeholders to the table, and providing the opportunity for the coalitions to enhance their visibility and reputations in the communities they serve.","output":"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the City Pilots Served by AB InBev Foundations Global Smart Drinking Goals Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has imposed new challenges and demands for health systems, especially in the development of new vaccine strategies. Vaccines for many pathogens were developed based on the display of foreign epitopes in the variable regions of the human adenovirus (HAdV) major capsid proteins (hexon, penton and fiber). The humoral immune response against the HAdV major capsid proteins was demonstrated to play a role in the development of an immune response against the epitopes in display. Through the immunoinformatic profiling of the major capsid proteins of HAdVs from different species, we developed a modular concept that can be used in the development of vaccines based on HAdV vectors. Our data suggests that different immunomodulatory potentials can be observed in the conserved regions, present in the hexon and penton proteins, from different species. Using this modular approach, we developed a HAdV-5 based vaccine strategy for SARS-CoV-2, constructed through the display of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes indicated by our prediction analysis as immunologically relevant. The sequences of the HAdV vector major capsid proteins were also edited to enhance the IFN-gamma induction and antigen presenting cells activation. This is the first study proposing a modular HAdV platform developed to aid the design of new vaccines by inducing an immune response more suited for the epitopes in display.","output":"Immunoinformatic construction of an adenovirus-based modular vaccine platform and its application in the design of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the problems hardly clarified in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis is to identify factors associated with a lower mortality of COVID-19 between countries to design strategies to cope with future unforeseen pandemics in society. The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >$2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of sustainability in environment that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.","output":"High health expenditures and low exposure of population to air pollution as critical factors that can reduce fatality rate in COVID-19 pandemic crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a strong response from the research community has been observed with the proliferation of independent clinical trials assessing diagnostic methods, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.

The amount of hydrogen calculated from photosynthetic model estimation associated with the C/H ratio is an essential parameter of the estimation model of productivity of organically bound tritium (OBT) by plants. To propose a sophisticated estimation model of OBT by agricultural plants, temporal changes in the C/H ratio of six plant species (Japanese radish, cabbage, orchard grass, paddy field rice, apple, and radish) during their cultivation were investigated for each plant part. The C/H ratio in the plants cultivated in the field and growth chamber generally exceeded 6, which is the value for the primary photosynthetic monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose (both chemical formulae, C6H12O6). In the vegetative parts (e.g. Japanese radish leaves, cabbage leaves and roots, rice leaves and roots, and radish leaves and fine roots) the C/H ratio fluctuated irregularly or remained constant within an approximate range of 6.6-7.3 during cultivation. The C/H ratio in enlarged organs (e.g. Japanese radish root, rice ear, apple fruit, and radish main root) decreased continuously, approaching 6. These results suggest that the C/H ratio can be generally set as approximately 6.9 except for enlarged organs, in which the ratio may change over time during cultivation, within an approximate range of 6-7.","output":"Investigation of ratio of carbon to hydrogen (C/H ratio) in agricultural plants for further estimation of their productivity of organically bound tritium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Brazil faces some challenges in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, including: the risks for cross-infection (community infection) increase in densely populated areas; low access to health services in areas where the number of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) is scarce and poorly distributed, mainly in states with low population density. Objective: To describe and intercorrelate epidemiology and geographic data from Brazil about the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The epidemiology and geographic data were correlated with the distribution of ICU beds (public and private health systems) and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The same data were correlated using partial correlation controlled by gross domestic product (GDP) and number of beneficiaries of private health insurance. Findings: Brazil has a large geographical area and diverse demographic and economic aspects. This diversity is also present in the states and the Federal District regarding the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case fatality rate. The effective management of severe COVID-19 patients requires ICU services, and the scenario was also dissimilar as for ICU beds and ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants for the public (SUS) and private health systems mainly at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of ICUs was uneven between public and private services, and most patients rely on SUS, which had the lowest number of ICU beds. In only a few states, the number of ICU beds at SUS was above 1 to 3 by 10,000 inhabitants, which is the number recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

However, discrepancies on target identification of the same viruses by different groups suggest that high throughput RNAi screening strategies need to be carefully designed, developed and optimized prior to the large scale screening. METHODS: Two genome-wide RNAi screens were performed in parallel against the entry of pseudotyped Marburg viruses and avian influenza virus H5N1 utilizing an HIV-1 based surrogate system, to identify host factors which are important for virus entry. A comparative analysis approach was employed in data analysis, which alleviated systematic positional effects and reduced the false positive number of virus-specific hits. RESULTS: The parallel nature of the strategy allows us to easily identify the host factors for a specific virus with a greatly reduced number of false positives in the initial screen, which is one of the major problems with high throughput screening. The power of this strategy is illustrated by a genome-wide RNAi screen for identifying the host factors important for Marburg virus and/or avian influenza virus H5N1 as described in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy is particularly useful for highly pathogenic viruses since pseudotyping allows us to perform high throughput screens in the biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment instead of the BSL-3 or BSL-4 for the infectious viruses, with alleviated safety concerns. The screening strategy together with the unique comparative analysis approach makes the data more suitable for hit selection and enables us to identify virus-specific hits with a much lower false positive rate.","output":"A parallel genome-wide RNAi screening strategy to identify host proteins important for entry of Marburg virus and H5N1 influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The main requirements when performing laparoscopic local resection for early mucosal tumors of the stomach are a clearly defined cancer-free margin and precise tumor localization. In this study, a novel method for precise intraoperative tumor localization and appropriate resection in a porcine model is introduced: endoscopic submucosal cutting and light transmission (ESCLT). METHODS A total of 15 cases of laparoscopic local resection were performed in 6 pigs. The size of the target lesions was approximately 20 mm. The imaginary lesions were located in the high body anterior wall, posterior wall, lower body posterior wall, angle, and antrum anterior wall of the stomach. Mucosal marking around the lesions, mucosal precutting surrounding the marking, and submucosal cutting along the precutting line using white light endoscopy were sequentially performed. Next, an endoscopic light source was placed directly in front of the lesion. Exact oval-shaped submucosal cutting margins were identified via laparoscopy. Laparoscopic local resection was performed after the minimal distance from the stapler line to the submucosal cutting line was confirmed. The sizes of the mucosal marking, submucosal cutting line, and the entire resected mucosa and serosa were measured. RESULTS The procedure was completed successfully in all pigs. Local resection was completed on all of the lesions. The mean endoscopic and laparoscopic procedure times were 26.1 and 12.7 min, respectively. The mean size of the resected specimens was: (i) marking lesion, 22  19.5 mm; (ii) submucosal cutting line, 26.7  23.2 mm; (iii) entire resected mucosa, 37  31 mm; and (iv) entire resected serosa, 41.7  33.1 mm. There was no intraoperative morbidity. CONCLUSION ESCLT provides a precise and useful method of intraoperative tumor localization during laparoscopic local resection of the stomach in terms of minimizing the resection of normal stomach tissue and guaranteeing adequate mucosal safety margins.","output":"A noble method for intraoperative fine localization during laparoscopic gastric local resection: endoscopic submucosal cutting and light transmission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing new HIV infection, but uptake remains challenging among Black and Hispanic/Latino persons.

Infected cells with a low level of activation remain latent and do not produce virus, while cells with a higher level of activation are more productive and thus likely to transfer more virions to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission. How the activation status of infected cells affects HIV dynamics under antiretroviral therapy remains unclear. We develop a new mathematical model that structures the population of infected cells continuously according to their activation status. The effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in blocking cell-to-cell viral transmission decreases as the level of activation of infected cells increases because the more virions are transferred from infected to uninfected cells during cell-to-cell transmission, the less effectively the treatment is able to inhibit the transmission. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the model is shown to determine the existence and stability of the equilibria. Using the principal spectral theory and comparison principle, we show that the infection-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] is less than one. By constructing Lyapunov functional, we prove that the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] is greater than one. Numerical investigation shows that even when treatment can completely block cell-free virus infection, virus can still persist due to cell-to-cell transmission. The random switch between infected cells with different activation levels can also contribute to the replenishment of the latent reservoir, which is considered as a major barrier to viral eradication. This study provides a new modeling framework to study the observations, such as the low viral load persistence, extremely slow decay of latently infected cells and transient viral load measurements above the detection limit, in HIV-infected patients during suppressive antiretroviral therapy.","output":"Dynamics of a new HIV model with the activation status of infected cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : COVID-19 may negatively impact the prognosis of patients with chronic HFrEF, and vice versa. METHODS: : This study included two parallel analyses among US patients in the TriNetX health database who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 as an inpatient or outpatient between January and September 2020. Analysis A included patients with a positive COVID-19 test, and compared patients with a history of worsening HFrEF (HF hospitalization or IV diuretic use in prior 12 months), HFrEF without worsening, and no prior HF. Analysis B included patients with history of HFrEF, and compared patients with positive vs. negative COVID-19 tests. Outcomes included mortality and worsening HF. In both analyses, pre-specified subgroup analyses stratified by inpatient vs. outpatient setting of COVID-19 test. RESULTS: : In Analysis A of 99,052 patients with a positive COVID-19 test, 514 (0.5%) and 524 (0.5%) patients had histories of worsening HFrEF and HFrEF without worsening, respectively. After adjustment, compared with non-HF patients, worsening HFrEF (risk ratio [RR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.10C1.83; p<0.001) and HFrEF without worsening (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96C1.84; p=0.06) were associated with higher 30-day mortality. Excess mortality risk tended to be pronounced among patients initially diagnosed with COVID-19 as outpatients (p for interaction 0.12 and 0.006, respectively). In Analysis B of 14,838 patients with HFrEF tested for COVID-19, 1,038 (7.0%) had positive tests. After adjustment, testing positive was associated with excess 30-day mortality risk (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38C2.02; p<0.001) and worsening HF (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17C1.51; p<0.001). Mortality risk was nominally more pronounced among patients presenting as outpatients (p for interaction 0.07). CONCLUSION: : In this large cohort of patients tested for COVID-19, among patients testing positive, a history of HFrEF with or without worsening was associated with excess mortality, particularly among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as outpatients. Among patients with established HFrEF, compared with testing negative, testing positive for COVID-19 was independently associated with higher risk of death and worsening HF.","output":"Prognostic Interplay Between COVID-19 and Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The use of robots in surgery has become commonplace in many specialties.

Patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) usually have symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath because of their cardiac condition and comorbidity, therefore these related symptoms challenge the correct diagnosis in time within the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE SUMMARY: We report two case studies of patients with LVAD in whom COVID-19 related symptoms were overlapped by their cardiac status and comorbidities. In the first case, the patient was admitted for suspicion of COVID-19 due to cough and shortness of breath for 1 month. The blood test evocated a high index of suspicion of COVID-19. The nasopharyngeal test for COVID-19 performed on admission and at Day 2 was inconclusive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the test obtained on Day 3 of admission was positive, whereas computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. This patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and nasal epistaxis within 48 h during hospitalization. The ARDS was treated by non-invasive ventilation and probabilistic antibiotics for 3 days and resulted significant improvement. The nasal epistaxis due to international normalized ratio increase was treated by nasal packing and vitamin K antagonist was switched to parenteral heparin infusion. The patient was kept hospitalized for 1 month for further supportive treatment. In the second case, the patient was admitted for recurrent anaemia due to melaena, the patient was tested for COVID-19 because of new-onset symptoms of cough and rhinorrhoea. The first nasopharyngeal test was positive, and sudden increase of anticoagulation status was noted in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding. The anticoagulation status was controlled by parenteral heparin infusion, and the melaena was disappeared at Day 3. The moderate dyspnoea of the patient was quickly improved with nasal oxygen delivery for 4 days. The patient was discharged at Day 5. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 specific symptoms are challenging to distinguish in patients with LVADs, although radiological evidence can be beneficial in the COVID-19 diagnosis. We also observed the need for precise anticoagulation control to avoid bleeding or thrombotic events in these patients.","output":"Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2: challenge for diagnosis and medical management in patients with left ventricular assist device: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic studies of the coelomic cavity in four green iguanas, four black and white tegus and four bearded dragons were performed using a conventional CT scanner.

For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS: We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions. RESULTS: For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13C59)%. With 2 days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55C85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to 4 and 3 days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64C88)% and 93 (91C97)%, respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5C17)% for a 2-day isolation policy and by 14 (5C26)% for 14 days. A 4-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52C64)%, while a 3-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79C83)%. In both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended post-fever isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days of isolation instead of one.","output":"Effectiveness of isolation policies in schools: evidence from a mathematical model of influenza and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainably feeding the growing population amid rising global temperatures and dwindling resources is a grand challenge facing mankind. Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha-1, especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PM enhanced grain yield and net economic return while lowering the N footprint without increasing Nr emission. Therefore, PM has great potential to mitigate Nr loss in China when crop species, N fertilization rate, and local environmental factors (i.e., growing region and annual precipitation) are appropriately considered.","output":"Plastic mulching reduces nitrogen footprint of food crops in China: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Excess mortality from all-cause has been estimated at national level for different countries, to provide a picture of the total burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, there have been no attempts at modelling it at high spatial resolution, needed to understand geographical differences in the mortality patterns, to evaluate temporal lags and to plan for future waves of the pandemic. Methods This is the first subnational study on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the third most-hit country. We considered municipality level and estimated all-cause mortality weekly trends based on the first four months of 2016 -- 2019. We specified a Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for spatial heterogeneity as well as for non-linear smooth spatio-temporal terms. We predicted the weekly mortality rates at municipality level for 2020 based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends (i.e.~in the absence of the pandemic) and estimated the excess mortality and the uncertainty surrounding it. Results We found strong evidence of excess mortality for Northern Italy, with higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February in Lombardia, with total excess deaths of 23,946 (23,013 -- 24,786), and the beginning of March for North East and North West with total excess deaths of 8,033 (7,061 -- 9,044) and 1,588 (404 -- 2,700) respectively.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected de-identified data on 1115 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January and November 2020, at 12 centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Patient characteristics including age, type of malignancy (hematologic malignancy [HM], lung cancer, and non-lung cancer were determined in association with severe illness as well as all-cause mortality within 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: By multivariable logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in cancer patients included age > 65 (OR 6.64; 95% CI 3.351to 12.55; p< 0.0001), ALC < 0.5 K/microliter (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.79; p=0.014), and anemia at < 10g/dl (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.30 to 4.44; p=0.005). Among cancer patients, the 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than in patients with non-lung cancer solid tumors, including those with lung metastases (22% vs 9%; p=0.001). Patients with HM tended to have higher 30-day mortality than patients with non-lung cancer solid tumors (13% vs 9% p=0.07) and tended to have a lower mortality rate than patients with lung cancer (p=0.07). Furthermore, HM patients were more likely to be lymphopenic and anemic at diagnosis as well as progress to LRTI and be placed on ventilatory support compared to non-lung cancer solid tumor patients ( p= or < 0.01). In addition, lung cancer and HM patients were more likely to develop hypoxia and require hospital admission than non-lung cancer solid tumor patients ( p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Lung cancer and HM patients are associated with the highest risk of progressing to severe disease and mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. Hence, cancer patient population should be given the highest priority as far as prevention [vaccination with boosters if needed] as well as preemptive early therapy with monoclonal antibodies right after the onset of COVID-19.

METHODS: We used routine care data from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.4 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (treatment group) versus standard of care (control group) among adults &#8805; 80 years old with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or CT-scan images typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring oxygen &#8805; 3 L/min, and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein &#8805; 40 mg/L). The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83 to 90), and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99). The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly for the proportion of patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.12, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.82). Twenty-two (16.7%) patients receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events, but only 11 (6.4%) from the control group.

It has a specific negative impact on the raw material supply, procurement management, production resumption, logistics, and market of the supply chain, which can trigger cascading failures in supply chain networks. Aiming at the failure of upstream/downstream firms in supply chain networks due to the decreased product demand/material supply under the COVID-19, the present study adopted an underload cascading failure model for the supply chain networks. In this model, the hierarchical supply chain networks were constructed based on the Erdos Renyi (ER) model and Barabasi Albert (BA) model. The validity of the model was verified under random attack and target attack. In the random attack mode, the influences of model parameters were studied, and in the target attack mode, the influence of target protection and random protection measures on enhancing network invulnerability was also studied. Simulation results showed that the initial load and capacity lower bound of nodes impact cascading failure size. The former has a positive correlation with cascading failure size, while the latter negatively correlates with cascading failure size. Furthermore, random protection measures are more practical to prevent cascading failures.

Even worse, the emergence of the COVID-19 Delta variant once again puts the world in danger. Fortunately, many countries and companies have started to develop coronavirus vaccines since the beginning of this disaster. Till now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The promotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of discussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as efficacy and security. However, there does not exist much research work to systematically analyze public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on Twitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental polarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a majority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often associated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after injections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study exploits popular NLP and topic modeling methods to mine people's opinions on the COVID-19 vaccines on social media and to analyse and visualise them objectively.

Now, many rely on EHRs, informal emails, or texts, introducing fragmentation and new data security challenges with new communication strategies. We aimed to examine the impact of a physician champion educational outreach intervention to promote electronic provider-to-provider communication in a large academic multispecialty group. METHODS Physician champions provided educational outreach to 16 academic departments, using 10-minute case-based presentations. Online surveys assessed communication preferences and practices. Electronic health record queries counted EHR messaging use before and after intervention. Descriptive statistics compared responses by specialty (z-test). Paired responses with pre-post data were compared using chi-square tests. Time series analysis assessed EHR messaging rates before intervention versus after intervention. RESULTS Five hundred seventeen providers responded to the postoutreach survey. Eighty-six percent were familiar with EHR messaging tool and 78% knew how to use it after intervention. Among practitioner groups, Family Medicine preferred EHR messaging the most (62%). Groups who declined outreach least preferred it (26%). Among 88 respondents with paired pre-post intervention surveys, familiarity rose (79-96%), and self-reported use increased (66-88%).

We present a deep learning-based approach to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions. The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients.

We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the medical databases from inception to March 31, 2020 to perform a systematic review of outcomes in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Data were pooled using a random effects regression model. Primary and secondary outcomes were neonatal clinical outcomes and infectious status, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 105 neonates fulfilling the study criteria were identified. The rates of preterm neonates and those small for gestational age (SGA) were 25 (23.8%) and 10 (11.2%), respectively. Among 91 neonates who were tested, 8 (8.8%) were positive for nucleic acids or antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 28 (26.7%) of the neonates were symptomatic and two test-negative neonates died, including one stillbirth. Between test-positive and test-negative groups, the rates of SGA, preterm delivery, duration between maternal symptom onset and delivery, and perinatal complication were not significantly different; but the rate of symptomatic after birth reached significant difference (62.5% vs 20.5%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Most neonates born to infected mothers had favorable outcomes.

Underlying differences in terms of health and social care system organisation, service provision models and pre-existing epidemiological context have resulted in heterogeneous scenarios for burden of disease (BoD) distribution, both in terms of COVID-19-specific outcomes, and because of collateral damage, not only across, but also within countries and regions. Individual proximal factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, underlying comorbidities and perception of risk have contributed to increased individual risk of acquiring the infection and of developing severe disease complications, including death. In addition, systemic issues, i.e., individual financial capacity, legal status, and acute versus chronic care needs have affected access both to care and commodity. From the global health perspective, we are also witnessing determinants threatening sustainable development, with tremendous differences in terms of capacity to combat the disease and deploy disease control measures, as well as ensure financial stability, economic growth and societal resilience. Ensuring equitable allocation of test, vaccines and medicines, and the development of comprehensive strategies necessitates a deeper understanding of those at most at risk, with due protection to those most vulnerable across the world. A comprehensive approach to tackle all these challenges, whilst ensuring due consideration is paid to ethical and legal issues, necessitates sound understanding of determinants, vulnerability with systematic measurement and interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral collaboration. This RT will bring the perspective of academia, researchers and practitioners in the field, and NGOs, offering insights on emerging research, practice and strategies.

CEUS images were first compared to B-mode US images performed at the same RFA session to determine the ability of CEUS to increase the conspicuity of lesions. A qualitative score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = excellent) was used to grade the ability to visualize the lesions. The preprocedure CEUS images were then evaluated using the most recent prior contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated with short-term follow-up imaging (median 1 month) for presence of residual or recurrent disease. RESULTS CEUS allows at least fair visualization (score 2) in 78% (reader 1) and 80% (reader 2) of the lesions not visualized by B-mode US, and 50% (reader 1) and 42% (reader 2) of the lesions poorly visualized by B-mode US.

RESULTS: Telemedicine allows ophthalmologists to work with on-site emergency care providers to interview and examine patients remotely in EDs, enabling proper assessment of patient history, visual acuity, pupils, intraocular pressure, as well as the anterior and posterior segment. To date, patients' perceptions of this new model of care have been largely positive. DISCUSSION: The use of telemedical consultations for remote evaluation of patients with ophthalmic complaints stands to improve the quality of care provided to patients and extend the reach of remote ophthalmologists.

The limits of detection of all the viruses analyzed by the RTisochip?-W system were equal to or less than 50 copiesL(?1), which is comparable to those of conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We also demonstrate that the RTisochip?-W system possesses the advantages of good repeatability, strong robustness, and high specificity. Finally, we analyzed 201 cases of preclinical samples, 14 cases of COVID-19-positive samples, 25 cases of clinically diagnosed samples, and 614 cases of clinical samples from patients or suspected patients with respiratory tract infections using the RTisochip?-W system. The test results matched the referenced results well and reflected the epidemic characteristics of the respiratory infectious diseases. The coincidence rate of the RTisochip?-W with the referenced kits was 98.15% for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Conversion to a duodenal switch with omentopexy and feeding jejunostomy was performed for these patients. METHODS Between September 2006 and January 2010, 41 revisional operations were performed at 1 institution and by 1 operating surgeon. The data were prospectively collected and reviewed for several parameters, including excess weight loss, mortality, and morbidity. These results are reported. RESULTS A total of 41 patients underwent conversion of their original bariatric operation to a duodenal switch with omentopexy and feeding jejunostomy. The initial operations had been gastric bypass in 32 patients, vertical banded gastroplasty in 5, and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in 4. The average excess weight loss was 54% in 31 patients at 6 months, 66% in 22 patients at 1 year, and 75% in 9 patients at 2 years. No patients died. The average hospital stay was 6.4 days. A total of 9 proven or suspected leaks (22%) developed. One was at the enverted staple line of a jejunojejunostomy that was diagnosed and treated the next day with little subsequent morbidity. The others were at the gastrogastrostomy or lateral gastric staple line and all occurred in conversions from gastric bypass. They were all ischemic type leaks and presented 5-11 days after surgery and closed relatively uneventfully with J-tube feedings and antibiotic/antifungal treatment. Other major complications included 1 pulmonary embolism (2%), 1 small bowel obstruction at the site of the feeding jejunostomy (2%), 2 stenoses (4%)-1 at the duodenoenterostomy and 1 in the body of the vertical gastrectomy. This gives a total major complication rate of 30%. A total of 3 patients required reoperation because of a jejunojejunostomy leak, small bowel obstruction, and stenosis at the vertical gastrectomy. No gastrogastrostomy leaks required surgical or radiologic intervention. One required revision for malnutrition, but otherwise the nutrition remained good. CONCLUSION Revisional surgery to a duodenal switch is a complex operation and carries a high potential for major complications. Nonetheless, it can be accomplished safely with good long-term results. Omentopexy, drainage, and feeding jejunostomy should be considered at surgery to treat the high potential for delayed ischemic leaks.","output":"Duodenal switch with omentopexy and feeding jejunostomy--a safe and effective revisional operation for failed previous weight loss surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined spike (S) gene sequences of the virus populations of four different commercial ArkDPI-derived infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccines before and during a single passage in specific pathogen free chickens. We found different degrees of genetic heterogeneity among the four vaccines before passage in chickens, ranging from no apparent heterogeneity to heterogeneity in 20 positions in the S gene. In all except one position, nucleotide differences were non-synonymous. The majority of amino acid differences were in the S1 subunit of the protein. For three of the four ArkDPI-derived vaccines, a single subpopulation with an S gene sequence distinct from the vaccine majority consensus at 5 to 11 codons was selected in chickens within 3 days after ocular vaccination. In contrast, we obtained no evidence for selection of specific subpopulations of the fourth ArkDPI-derived vaccine or Massachusetts or DE072 serotype vaccines. The virus subpopulations within each vaccine selected by chickens are similar in their S1 gene sequences, but distinct in the 3' portion of the S2 subunit gene for each of the three vaccines. In the S1 gene, the selected subpopulations are more similar to the virulent parental ArkDPI isolate than to the predominant vaccine population. The different proportions of distinct subpopulations in Ark vaccines apparently more fit for replication in the respiratory tract of chickens might cause different degrees of damage to respiratory epithelium and/or immune responses in vaccinated chickens.

Less is known about the psychological responses of working during the pandemic on hospital-based registered nurses (RNs) in the United States (US). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to report the well-being of U.S.-based hospital RNs working during the initial acute phase of COVID-19 and compare it with well-being among healthcare workers described in two global meta-analyses. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May-June 2020 (N=467). Well-being was measured using the following tools: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 for depressive symptoms, Impact of Events Scale-Revised for traumatic stress, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Compared with global rates from two meta-analyses, US-based RNs reported significantly more traumatic stress (54.6% vs. 11.4% and 21.5%; p<.001) and depressive symptoms (54.6% vs. 31.8% and 21.7%; p<.001). Rates of insomnia were also higher in U.S.-based RNs than in the meta-analysis that reported insomnia (32.4% vs 27.8%; p<.033). Rates of anxiety symptoms among US-based RNs did not differ from that reported in one meta-analysis (37.3% vs. 34.4%), while it was significantly higher in the other (37.3% vs. 22.1%; p<.001). Hospital-based RNs from the US exhibited over twice the rates of trauma and nearly double the rates of depressive symptoms than shown in reports from hospital workers globally during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We enrolled children (<18 years) with influenza infection and respiratory failure across 34 pediatric intensive care units 11/2008C5/2016. We compared baseline characteristics, clinical courses, and therapies in children with MRSA coinfection, non-MRSA bacterial coinfection, and no bacterial coinfection. RESULTS: We enrolled 170 children (127 influenza A, 43 influenza B). Children with influenzaCMRSA pneumonia (N = 30, 87% previously healthy) were older than those with non-MRSA (N = 61) or no (N = 79) bacterial coinfections. InfluenzaCMRSA was associated with increased leukopenia, acute lung injury, vasopressor use, extracorporeal life support, and mortality than either group (P  .0001). Influenza-related mortality was 40% with MRSA compared to 4.3% without (relative risk [RR], 9.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8C22.9).

By calibrating the parameters of the EDM to the reported data in Hubei Province of China, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak. We compare the EDM applied to WR and the Gompertz model, which is based on exponential decay and is often used to estimate cumulative events. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model to short-term forecast of the epidemic, and to predict the final epidemic size. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the model applied to data from February 27 until the 17th of March estimate that the cumulative number of infected could reach 131,280 (with a credibility interval 71,415-263,501) by April 25 (credibility interval April 12 to May 3). With the data available until the 24st of March the peak date should be reached on May 3 (April 23 to May 23) with 197,179 cumulative infections expected (130,033C315,269); with data available until the 31st of March the peak should be reached on May 4 (April 25 to May 18) with 202,210 cumulative infections expected (155.235C270,737); with data available until the 07st of April the peak should be reached on May 3 (April 26 to May 11) with 191,586 (160,861-232,023) cumulative infections expected.

These adaptations vary in magnitude and direction following different patterns of opioid exposure, but few studies have systematically manipulated the pattern of opioid administration while measuring neurobiological and behavioral impact. We exposed male and female mice to morphine for one week, with administration patterns that were either intermittent (daily injections) or continuous (osmotic minipump infusion). We then interrupted continuous morphine exposure with either naloxone-precipitated or spontaneous withdrawal. Continuous morphine exposure caused tolerance to the psychomotor-activating effects of morphine, whereas both intermittent and interrupted morphine exposure caused long-lasting psychomotor sensitization. Given links between locomotor sensitization and mesolimbic dopamine signaling, we used fiber photometry and a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to conduct longitudinal measurements of dopamine dynamics in the nucleus accumbens. Locomotor sensitization caused by interrupted morphine exposure was accompanied by enhanced dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens. To further assess downstream consequences on striatal gene expression, we used next-generation RNA sequencing to perform genome-wide transcriptional profiling in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. The interruption of continuous morphine exposure exacerbated drug-evoked transcriptional changes in both nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, dramatically increasing differential gene expression and engaging unique signaling pathways. Our study indicates that opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior are critically dependent on the pattern of drug administration, and exacerbated by interruption of continuous exposure. Maintaining continuity of chronic opioid administration may, therefore, represent a strategy to minimize iatrogenic effects on brain reward circuits.","output":"Interruption of continuous opioid exposure exacerbates drug-evoked adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transactional distance continues to be a major issue in Distance Education (DE) as resolutions to guarantee and support it are not wholly contingent on technological affordances, but depend on interactions, communication, and motivational channels embedded in pedagogical practices.

Therefore, Affibody molecules (6.5 kDa) have a potential for being suitable as targeted moiety for radiolabeled therapeutic proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that a fusion of an Affibody molecule with an albumin-binding domain (ABD) provides a strong noncovalent binding to albumin in vivo. This strong noncovalent binding can be used for reduction of the renal uptake of the Affibody molecule while maintaining a size smaller than that of an antibody, which is important when using residualizing radionuclide labels conjugated to Affibody molecules. The goal of this study was to design and evaluate a new targeting Affibody-ABD fusion protein with improved biodistribution properties for radionuclide therapy. METHODS A novel Affibody-based construct, ZHER2:2891-ABD035-DOTA (ABY-027), was created by fusion of the reengineered HER2-binding Affibody molecule ZHER2:2891 to the N terminus of the high-affinity ABD035, and a maleimido-derivative of DOTA was conjugated at the C terminus of the construct. Binding and processing of (177)Lu-ABY-027 by HER2-expressing cells were evaluated in vitro. Targeting of HER2-expressing SKOV-3 xenografts was evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice and compared with targeting of previously reported ABD-(ZHER2:342)2. RESULTS The binding affinity (dissociation constant) of ABY-027 to HER2 (74 pM) was the same as for the parental ZHER2:2891 (76 pM). ABY-027 was stably labeled with (177)Lu and (111)In with preserved specific binding to HER2-expressing cells in vitro. In vivo receptor saturation experiments demonstrated that targeting of SKOV-3 xenografts in BALB/C nu/nu mice was HER2-specific. (177)Lu-ABY-027 demonstrated substantially (2- to 3-fold) lower renal and hepatic uptake than previously assessed HER2-specific Affibody-based albumin-binding agents. Tumor uptake of radiolabeled ABY-027 at 48 h after injection was 2-fold higher than that for previously reported ABD-(ZHER2:342)2. CONCLUSION An optimized molecular design of an ABD fusion protein resulted in an Affibody molecule construct with better properties for therapy. Fully preserved in vivo targeting of the fusion protein was shown in xenografted mice. Site-specific coupling of DOTA provides a uniform conjugate and creates the potential for labeling with a broad range of therapeutic radionuclides. The biodistribution of (177)Lu-ABY-027 in a murine model suggests it is more suitable for therapy than alternative approaches.","output":"Site-specific radiometal labeling and improved biodistribution using ABY-027, a novel HER2-targeting affibody molecule-albumin-binding domain fusion protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute liver failure is marked by the rapid deterioration of liver function in a previously well patient over period of days to weeks.

The sagittal balance significantly associated with lumbar loading is largely dependent on L5-S1 segment. However, the evidence indicating risk factors for radiological and symptomatic ASD after minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) remains insufficient. METHODS: This single-central retrospective study recruited patients with lumbosacral degeneration receiving MIS-TLIF at the L5-S1 level from January 2015 to December 2018. The targeted variables included demographic information, radiological indicators, surgery-related parameters, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) extracted from the electronic medical system by natural language processing. In these patients, a minimum of 3-year follow-up was done. After reviewing the preoperative and postoperative follow-up digital radiographs, patients were assigned to radiological ASD group (disc height narrowing 3 mm, progressive slipping 3 mm, angular motion >10, and osteophyte formation >3 mm), symptomatic ASD group, and control group. We identified potential predictors for radiological and symptomatic ASD with the service of stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 157 consecutive patients treated with MIS-TLIF in our department, 16 cases (10.2%) were diagnosed with radiological ASD at 3-year follow-up. The clinical evaluation did not reveal suspicious risk factors, but several significant differences were confirmed in radiological indicators. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed postoperative PI, postoperative DA, and ?PI-LL in radiological ASD group were significantly different from those in control group. Nevertheless, for patients diagnosed with simultaneously radiological and symptomatic ASD, postoperative DA and postoperative PT as risk factors significantly affected the clinical outcome following MIS-TLIF. CONCLUSION: In this study, while approximately 10% of lumbosacral degenerations develop radiographic ASD, prognosis-related symptomatic ASD was shown not to be a frequent postoperative complication. Postoperative PI, postoperative DA, and mismatched PI-LL are risk factors for radiological ASD, and postoperative DA and postoperative PT are responsible for the occurrence of symptomatic ASD following MIS-TLIF. These radiological risk factors demonstrate that restoration of normal sagittal balance is an effective measure to optimize treatment strategies for secondary ASD prevention.","output":"Analysis of Risk Factors for Adjacent Segment Degeneration after Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Interbody Fusion at Lumbosacral Spine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of Covid-19 on stock markets across G7 countries and their business sectors We highlight the synchronicity and severity of this unprecedented crisis We find strong transition evidence to a crisis regime in all countries and sectors, yet crisis intensity and timings vary The Health Care and Consumer services sectors were the most severely affected;a reflection of the Covid-19 drug-race and international travel restrictions The Technology sector was hit the latest and least severely, as imposed lockdown measures forced people to explore various web-based entertainment and distraction options Country-wise the UK and the US were the most affected with the highest heterogeneity in their business sectors' response;a possible reflection of the ambiguity in the initial response and adoption of lockdown measures Financial markets' response to Covid-19 is akin to response in previous financial crisis rather than previous pandemics A series of robustness checks confirms our findings","output":"The impact of Covid-19 on G7 stock markets volatility: Evidence from a ST-HAR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Kenya introduced the monovalent G1P [8] Rotarix? vaccine into the infant immunization schedule in July 2014. We examined trends in rotavirus group A (RVA) genotype distribution pre- (January 2010CJune 2014) and post- (July 2014CDecember 2018) RVA vaccine introduction. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from children aged < 13 years from four surveillance sites across Kenya: Kilifi County Hospital, Tabitha Clinic Nairobi, Lwak Mission Hospital, and Siaya County Referral Hospital (children aged < 5 years only). Samples were screened for RVA using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and VP7 and VP4 genes sequenced to infer genotypes. RESULTS: We genotyped 614 samples in pre-vaccine and 261 in post-vaccine introduction periods. During the pre-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent RVA genotypes were G1P [8] (45.8%), G8P [4] (15.8%), G9P [8] (13.2%), G2P [4] (7.0%) and G3P [6] (3.1%). In the post-vaccine introduction period, the most frequent genotypes were G1P [8] (52.1%), G2P [4] (20.7%) and G3P [8] (16.1%). Predominant genotypes varied by year and site in both pre and post-vaccine periods. Temporal genotype patterns showed an increase in prevalence of vaccine heterotypic genotypes, such as the commonly DS-1-like G2P [4] (7.0 to 20.7%, P < .001) and G3P [8] (1.3 to 16.1%, P < .001) genotypes in the post-vaccine introduction period. Additionally, we observed a decline in prevalence of genotypes G8P [4] (15.8 to 0.4%, P < .001) and G9P [8] (13.2 to 5.4%, P < .001) in the post-vaccine introduction period. Phylogenetic analysis of genotype G1P [8], revealed circulation of strains of lineages G1-I, G1-II and P [8]-1, P [8]-III and P [8]-IV. Considerable genetic diversity was observed between the pre and post-vaccine strains, evidenced by distinct clusters. CONCLUSION: Genotype prevalence varied from before to after vaccine introduction. Such observations emphasize the need for long-term surveillance to monitor vaccine impact. These changes may represent natural secular variation or possible immuno-epidemiological changes arising from the introduction of the vaccine.

One of the most frequently reported data is sex-related severity and mortality: according to the last available analysis on 239,709 patients in Italy, lethality is 17.7% in men and 10.8% in women, with 59% of total deaths being men. Interestingly, the infection rate is lower in males than in females, with 45.8% and 54.2% of positive cases, respectively, suggesting that gender-related factor may worsen disease evolution. A tentative hypothesis to explain these findings is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 involved in viral infection. PURPOSE: In this review, we summarize the available evidence pointing to gender-related differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, from both genetic and endocrine points of view. RESULTS: Altogether, available evidence points toward two not-mutually exclusive mechanisms in gender susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex hormonal regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. On one hand, ACE2 expression could be increased in women, either by estrogens or constitutively by X chromosome inactivation escape or by reduced methylation, providing a larger reservoir of ACE2 to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of RAS regulatory axis. On the other, low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, despite the increased expression of ACE2, which represents the Trojan horse for SARS-CoV-2 entry. CONCLUSIONS: Both mechanisms consistently point to the role of sex hormones and sex chromosomes in the differential severity and lethality of COVID-19 in men and women.","output":"Gender susceptibility to COVID-19: a review of the putative role of sex hormones and X chromosome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic protozoan disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans.

This has changed the way people live and are included socially. This paper focuses on the unexpected ways schools have altered and deepened social inclusion for children with learning disabilities during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. We interviewed six people: two people who work for a Local Authority, one Headteacher of a special school, one Special Educational Needs and Disability Consultant, one young person with a learning disability and her mother. The findings and conclusions show the new normal caused by COVID\\\\19 can help to deepen social inclusion for children with learning disabilities. For example, it can help children communicate in alternative ways with their teachers and friends. It can help families to understand more about their son/daughter's educational abilities; this means they can advocate better for them. It can help professionals to meet the needs of children with learning disabilities more quickly. We do not enjoy living at a social distance from everyone else, but we do want to make sure that lessons can be learnt from this moment in time. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: To slow the spread of COVID\\\\19, on 20 March 2020, nurseries, schools and colleges across England were closed to all learners, apart from those who were children of key workers or were considered vulnerable. As young people with learning disabilities, families, professionals and schools become acquainted with the Erfahrung of the new horizon brought about by COVID\\\\19, the negativity of altered social inclusion is becoming the new normal. Capturing this transitory moment in time, this paper reflexively analyses the curiously productive variables of altered ecological pathways to social inclusion for people with learning disabilities. METHODS: Taking a hermeneutic stance, this paper draws on Gadamer's construction of the nature of new experiences. Focussed on the experience of social inclusion during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, semi\\\\structured interviews were conducted with six key stakeholders. As the phenomenon in question was new, an inductive approach to thematic analysis was applied. FINDINGS: The critical tenet of this paper is that the Erfahrung of COVID\\\\19 has created the conditions for a new normal which have afforded children with learning disabilities altered opportunities for social inclusion, whether that be through increased power/agency for them and their families and/or new modes of connectedness leading to enhanced relationships. CONCLUSION: Whilst the impact of COVID\\\\19 has been a negative one for many aspects of society, application of Simplican and Gadamer's theories on social inclusion and the nature of new experiences has permitted the surfacing of new possibilities for the social inclusion of children with learning disabilities.","output":"Decommissioning normal: COVID\\\\19 as a disruptor of school norms for young people with learning disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 emerged in late 2019, governments and local authorities have drawn up policies to mitigate the impact of the virus and protect their population. They implement preventive measures that include sanitary guidelines and rules related to people's mobility and social interactions. Such efforts have disrupted business, educational, and social activities, requiring the adaptation of the people to a new reality that, consequently, has shifted their energy demand patterns. These changes in the energy demand bring challenges to the energy benchmarking efforts, which has been an effective steppingstone for improving the energy performance, allowing users to compare their consumption relative to others and detect the opportunities for improvement from the current state. Also, the changes in the consumption patterns also make it challenging to identify and target underperforming users. Consequently, in this study, we propose an adjusted benchmarking system that accounts for the impact of COVID-19 on the energy consumption patterns of Dubai using available public data. We utilized monthly electrical consumption and dwelling profile data from 1,841 residential buildings between January 2020 and June 2021. We built two different statistical models, a pre-covid and post-covid model, according to different characteristics of the dwellings such as gross floor area, number of users, a cooling source, and time-dependent weather variables such as outdoor temperature. Finally, we compare both models to underline the significance of COVID-19 in the adjusted energy benchmarks. The resulting adjusted model serves to estimate the average consumption of residents in Dubai throughout the year. Furthermore, both models' difference helps define the adjusted range of the users over/underperforming. The findings and conclusions of this study demonstrate the need for built adjusted benchmarking systems to continue effectively categorizing users' energy consumption under unusual conditions such as COVID-19. ? 2021 WITPress.

Prior studies of machine learning to screen for COVID-19 have relied largely upon radiographic and laboratory data. Few have used clinical symptoms alone to screen for COVID-19, and most are limited by sample size. We adapted an existing, open source machine learning pipeline to identify symptoms associated with COVID-19 using a large national cohort of Veterans with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We included members of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Birth Cohort (n=4,221,135) who had PCR-confirmed COVID- 19 between 01/01/2020-06/15/2020. Veterans with an outpatient VA visit from 03/01/2018-02/29/2020 were analyzed. To identify symptoms associated with COVID-19, we adapted the open source v3NLP platform. This symptom pipeline consists of several features (Figure) and was restricted to identify fever, cough, anosmia/ageusia, dyspnea, congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, chills, confusion/altered mental status, myalgia, and fatigue. Before running this pipeline, a multidisciplinary team of 9 clinicians first developed an annotation guideline. Each will use the guideline to review of 100 random notes that include information about symptoms to evaluate interrater agreement. This guideline will be revised until a kappa of 0.85 for inter-rater reliability is achieved. The multidisciplinary team will then review a random subset of 900 notes to assess agreement between pipeline- and human-identified symptoms. Each clinician will review and annotate 150 notes so that each note is reviewed by at least 2 clinicians. We will run the symptom pipeline on text from clinical notes of Veterans with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and evaluate the performance of symptom identification with snippet annotation. Results: The sample included all clinical notes (n=1,641,935) identified two weeks before through two weeks after a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Initial testing found the opensource symptom pipeline achieved an F-measure (harmonic mean of positive predictive value and sensitivity) of 0.71 to detect symptoms and an overall F-measure of 0.87 indicating excellent performance when combined with detecting negative symptoms. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the method by which an existing open source machine learning pipeline can be adapted to identify symptoms associated with COVID-19. This work has broad applications and is distinguished by its focus on symptoms commonly reported in clinical notes. Future studies may consider applying this methodology to screen for symptoms in populations of interest (e.g., persons with prior COVID-19 or immunization against COVID-19) or to develop an electronic medical recordbased syndromic surveillance system.","output":"Machine learning to identify symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a national cohort of veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Solidarity has become the term of the hour The World Health Organization organized a solidarity series of events, under the hashtag together at home, and chose the title Solidarity for the ambitious global initiative to find a treatment to the virus, establishing a Solidarity response fund Within countries, solidarity was raised as a value requiring the imposition of various social distancing measures and limitations, needed, it was argued, in order to protect both society as a whole, as well as individuals who were especially vulnerable to the virus The different approaches taken by countries in responding to the COVID-19 crisis can, in part, be explained by the different social perceptions regarding the importance of social solidarity and the duties that stem from it The notion of solidarity, explored below, underlies the web of mutual commitments among members of a community, and, in the case of states, among members of the political community This article examines the role solidarity can play when recognized as a constitutional value Narratives of solidarity are prevalent in constitutions world-wide, both implicitly and explicitly Despite this prevalence, constitutional scholarship has payed relatively little attention to the notion of solidarity The article aims to take a step in filling this gap It calls for recognition and discussion of the significance, potential and perils of recognizing solidarity as a constitutional value and of applying it in constitutional adjudication The article argues that despite the liberal aversion of the notion of solidarity, which is understandable in light of potential abuses of the concept to justify limitations of individual freedom, solidarity is a precondition for the existence of just societies and for distributive justice, as well as for ensuring that human rights are equally and inclusively realized The article argues that the relationship between collective identity and solidarity is complex, that solidarity is a multi-layered phenomenon, and that these complexities can and should be reflected in the constitutional manifestation of solidarity Constitutions do and should refer to more than one layer of solidarity, and courts can and should play a part in instilling substance in these layers Where solidarity is recognizing as a value, it can serve to examine the effect of laws and policies on under-privileged members of society, and as a source for deriving duties towards them Finally, the article argues that although constitutional solidarity may intuitively be expected to endorse only intra-state solidarity, that is, solidarity among members of the political community, constitutions can and do endorse notions of transnational solidarity The article argues that constitutionalism can thus be an important source of bottom-up transnational and global solidarity","output":"Constitutionalism and Social Solidarity: A Theoretical and Comparative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanotechnology and nanomedicine have excellent potential in dealing with a range of different health problems, including viruses, which are considered to be a serious challenge in the medical field.

The questionnaire included questions about categories of telemedicine used, purpose of use, challenges encountered during the use of telemedicine, and reasons for not using telemedicine technology. We adopted a proportionate random sampling technique to recruit participants by three ways: social media, phone calls, and face-to-face. Results The final dataset included 1584 participants, of which 496 (31.3%) used telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common reasons for not using telemedicine during COVID-19 was having no idea that telemedicine exists (38.3%, 417/1088) or having no idea how to use it (33.5%, 365/1088). Telemedicine users reported that that telepharmacy (89.7%), teleconsultation (78.2%), and telediagnosis (23.0%) were the most frequently used telemedicine services during the COVID-19 crisis. Of the 496 telemedicine users, 469 (94.6%) reported using telemedicine for seeking a pharmacist advice about medication instructions, 422 (85.1%) for ordering non-prescription drugs, and 401 (80.8%) for seeking a physician advice. those with high activity on social media were less likely to be associated with telemedicine users versus non-users.

Preliminary studies all suggest that there is neither link, nor indeed any theoretical reason why any of the COVID-19 vaccines might affect fertility. Dissemination of misinformation regarding the impact of the vaccine on future fertility needs to be controlled in order to avoid any hesitancy amongst young women attending for vaccination.

These changes often resulted in faculty members taking on new or additional responsibilities related to teaching and field. This work explores the experiences of full time faculty members from the 18 accredited Masters of Social Work (MSW) programs in Texas. Sixty faculty members completed an online survey about changes to their teaching and field related responsibilities during COVID-19. Results indicate that non-tenure track faculty were most acutely impacted by these changes, leading to significant increases in both teaching and field responsibilities relative to their tenure track peers. Additionally, faculty working at private institutions reported less of an impact on their workload than those working at public institutions. These results underscore the importance of supporting non-tenure track faculty, who are often women and from racial/ethnic groups historically underrepresented in academia, who are afforded less job security and employment related benefits, as they continue to take on additional responsibilities essential to the continued operation of MSW programs.

Since no effective treatment for COVID-19 has yet been discovered, a variety of drugs approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been suggested for repurposing strategy. In the current study, we predicted that doxycycline could interact with the nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and is therefore expected to hinder the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) through docking analysis. Further, the molecular dynamics results revealed that the RdRp-Doxycycline complex was structurally relatively stable during the dynamic period (100 ns), and its complex maintained close contact with their active catalytic domains of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The molecular mechanics PoissonCBoltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculation of binding free energy also showed that the doxycycline has worthy affinities with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. As expected, doxycycline effectively inhibited the viral replication of IHU strains of SARS-CoV-2 (IHUMI-3 and IHUMI-6), identified from the hospitalized patients in IHU Mditerrane Infection (IHUMI), Marseille, France. Moreover, doxycycline inhibited the viral load in vitro at both on-entry and after viral entry of IHU variants of SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that doxycycline exhibits strains-dependant antiviral activity against COVID-19. As a result, the current study concludes that doxycycline may be more effective in combination with other drugs for better COVID-19 treatment efficacy.","output":"Repurposing of Doxycycline to Hinder the Viral Replication of SARS-CoV-2: From in silico to in vitro Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has forced to reconsider the methods of rehabilitation of patients with emergency conditions, including neurology.

In particular, the two largest communities present a persistently polarized political leaning, reflected in the consumption of ideologically homogeneous groups of media outlets.

AMD patients are tormented by progressive central blurring/loss of vision and have limited therapeutic options to date. Drusen accumulation causing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell damage is the hallmark of AMD pathogenesis, in which oxidative stress and inflammation are the well-known molecular mechanisms. However, the underlying mechanisms of how RPE responds when exposed to drusen are still poorly understood. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role in cellular responses to stress and the regulation of homeostasis and diseases. Apart from the classical apoptosis, recent studies also discovered novel PCD pathways such as pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, which may contribute to RPE cell death in AMD. This evidence may yield new treatment targets for AMD. In this review, we summarized and analyzed recent advances on the association between novel PCD and AMD, proposing PCDs role as a therapeutic new target for future AMD treatment.","output":"Novel Programmed Cell Death as Therapeutic Targets in Age-Related Macular Degeneration?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause severe disease in humans.

In our study, we used hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 virus to investigate the related signaling pathways and their relationship to dysregulated innate immune reaction. We found the HA of H5N1 avian influenza triggered an abnormal innate immune signalling in the pulmonary epithelial cells, through an unusual process involving activation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) that is exclusively associated with c chain and is essential for signaling via all c cytokine receptors. By using a selective JAK3 inhibitor and JAK3 knockout mice, we have, for the first time, demonstrated the ability to target active JAK3 to counteract injury to the lungs and protect immunocytes from acute hypercytokinemia -induced destruction following the challenge of H5N1 HA in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of the present data, it appears that the efficacy of selective JAK3 inhibition is likely based on its ability to block multiple cytokines and protect against a superinflammatory response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) attack. Our findings highlight the potential value of selective JAK3 inhibitor in treating the fatal immunopathology caused by H5N1 challenge.","output":"Hemagglutinin from the H5N1 Virus Activates Janus Kinase 3 to Dysregulate Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The conceptual framework of One Health (OH) provides a strategy for promoting collaboration across the nexus of animal, human, and environmental health, which is essential for tackling emerging disease threats, such as COVID-19. However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION: Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.","output":"Faculty Perceptions: A Qualitative Study of the Perceived Need, Opportunities, and Challenges of Developing \\"One Health-One Medicine\\" in the Medical, Veterinary, and Public Health Curricula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout China and many other countries around the world The antivirals are important measures to this epidemic;however, there is no drug approved for against coronavirus yet With the continuously rising number of confirmed/suspected cases of COVID-19, it is urgent to obtain antiviral drugs for the clinical treatment In response to this situation, drug repurposing strategy becomes one of the best approaches for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery By retrieving the clinical trials registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials gov, a total of 14 chemical drugs were registered for COVID-19 In this review, we summarize and analyze the 14 drugs' indications, targets, and research basis related to the activities against viral infections, esp coronavirus infections We are making efforts to understand the evidence basis of these drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection applied by various research and clinical institutions in response to this COVID-19 outbreak, and also providing clues for quick response to possible epidemic in future and reasonable expansion of the indications of drugs","output":"Analysis of chemical drugs applied for clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a prospective cohort study of 311 outpatients with non-severe COVID-19 (187 women, median age 39 years).

Endothelial cells lacking TLR2 exhibited reduced proinflammatory potential at the protein, cell, and tissue levels. Loss of endothelial TLR2 blunted the inflammatory response to both exogenous and endogenous danger signals in endothelial cells in culture and in vivo. Endothelial TLR2 promoted tumor growth, angiogenesis, and protumorigenic immune cell recruitment in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the cell surface localization of P-selectin and the subsequent production of other critical cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells required endothelial TLR2.

The only hope we have for dealing with the problem is to produce sufficient vaccines and administer them efficiently. However, the current demand for vaccines greatly exceeds the supply, and many people will suffer from the disease for still some time. Moreover, the period for immunity obtained by the vaccines remains unknown, and we cannot predict how long the world will suffer the COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there will be a continued demand for treatments of its symptoms. An alternative solution for providing such treatment is the use of traditional medicinal plants. Aims: To document medicinal plants used by Hmong and Karen in Thailand to treat mild symptoms of COVID-19. Methods: Traditional knowledge about ethnomedicinal plants used by Hmong and Karen in Thailand for treating mild symptoms listed by WHO as associated with COVID 19, was collected in field interviews and extracted from the literature. Results: We identified 491 plant species used medicinally by both ethnic groups to treat fever, cough, diarrhea, muscle pain and ache, rash, headache, sore throat, and conjunctivitis. Of the 491 species 60 were mentioned at least five times in the literature or in our field data. Of these 60 species, we propose the most commonly used ones for treatments of mild COVID-19 symptoms. Ten of these most commonly mentioned species were used for treatments of fever, nine for treatment of cough, four for treatment of diarrhea, two for treatment of rash, and a single species was used to treat muscle pain and headache. Conclusion: This study suggests alternative treatments for mild symptoms of COVID-19 with medicinal plants that are traditionally used by the ethnic minority groups of the Hmong and Karen in Thailand. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, its mild symptoms are shared with many other diseases.

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, and how this varies between countries may inform the design of possible strategies to shield those at highest risk. Methods We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease by age (5-year age groups), sex and country (n=188) based on prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2017 and United Nations population estimates for 2020. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at-risk because of their age, using thresholds from 50-70 years. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 disease was determined by mapping conditions listed in GBD to the guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and US. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. Results We estimate that 1.7 (1.0 - 2.4) billion individuals (22% [15-28%] of the global population) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The share of the population at increased risk ranges from 16% in Africa to 31% in Europe. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic respiratory disease (CRD) were the most prevalent conditions in males and females aged 50+ years. African countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and Island countries with a high prevalence of diabetes, also had a high share of the population at increased risk. The prevalence of multimorbidity (>1 underlying conditions) was three times higher in Europe than in Africa (10% vs 3%). Conclusion Based on current guidelines and prevalence data from GBD, we estimate that one in five individuals worldwide has a condition that is on the list of those at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. However, for many of these individuals the underlying condition will be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be captured in health systems, and in some cases the increase in risk may be quite modest. There is an urgent need for robust analyses of the risks associated with different underlying conditions so that countries can identify the highest risk groups and develop targeted shielding policies to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"How many are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease?

Levels of lactoferrin and erythrocyte catalase ferritin, neutrophil myeloperoxidase were studied against the background of successful treatment in the group of pulmonary tuberculosis patients (n = 80) and the group of COVID-19 patients (n = 75). Their correlation with parameters of free radical oxidation and antioxidant protection was assessed. Results. Before treatment, the median level of lactoferrin and ferritin increased in both groups, but in the COVID-19 Group, it was significantly more pronounced. At the end of the intensive phase in the Tuberculosis Group and when clinical improvement was achieved in the COVID-19 Group, the median ferritin level decreased. Increased myeloperoxidase activity and decreased level of erythrocyte catalase were also noted in both groups before treatment start;in the COVID-19 Group, the median level of myeloperoxidase was higher versus the Tuberculosis Group, which correlated with a higher median level of ferritin and lactoferrin in this group. After the end of the intensive phase of tuberculosis treatment and achievement of clinical improvement in COVID-19, there was a decrease in the median levels of myeloperoxidase, which coincided with a decrease in the levels of lactoferrin and ferritin.

The strength of this system is illustrated by the fact that, despite some temporary discomfort like a common cold or diarrhea, most viral infections will not cause major harm to the healthy immunocompetent host. To achieve this, the immune system is equipped with a wide array of pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent coordinated type I IFN response orchestrated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). The production of type I IFN subtypes by dendritic cells (DCs), but also other cells is crucial for the execution of many antiviral processes. Despite this coordinated response, morbidity and mortality are still common in viral disease due to the ability of viruses to exploit the weaknesses of the immune system. Viruses successfully evade immunity and infection can result in aberrant immune responses. However, these weaknesses also open opportunities for improvement via clinical interventions as can be seen in current vaccination and antiviral treatment programs. The application of IFNs, Toll\\\\like receptor ligands, DCs, and antiviral proteins is now being investigated to further limit viral infections.

We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell and antibody responses in health-care workers with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection following a single dose of the BNT162b2 (tozinameran; PfizerCBioNTech) mRNA vaccine. METHODS: We sampled health-care workers enrolled in the PITCH study across four hospital sites in the UK (Oxford, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Sheffield). All health-care workers aged 18 years or older consenting to participate in this prospective cohort study were included, with no exclusion criteria applied. Blood samples were collected where possible before vaccination and 28 (7) days following one or two doses (given 3C4 weeks apart) of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Previous infection was determined by a documented SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR result or the presence of positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies. We measured spike-specific IgG antibodies and quantified T-cell responses by interferon- enzyme-linked immunospot assay in all participants where samples were available at the time of analysis, comparing SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals to those with previous infection. FINDINGS: Between Dec 9, 2020, and Feb 9, 2021, 119 SARS-CoV-2-naive and 145 previously infected health-care workers received one dose, and 25 SARS-CoV-2-naive health-care workers received two doses, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. In previously infected health-care workers, the median time from previous infection to vaccination was 268 days (IQR 232C285). At 28 days (IQR 27C33) after a single dose, the spike-specific T-cell response measured in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was higher in previously infected (n=76) than in infection-naive (n=45) health-care workers (median 284 [IQR 150C461] vs 55 [IQR 24C132] spot-forming units [SFUs] per 10(6) PBMCs; p<00001). With cryopreserved PBMCs, the T-cell response in previously infected individuals (n=52) after one vaccine dose was equivalent to that of infection-naive individuals (n=19) after receiving two vaccine doses (median 152 [IQR 119C275] vs 162 [104C258] SFUs/10(6) PBMCs; p=100). Anti-spike IgG antibody responses following a single dose in 142 previously infected health-care workers (median 270 373 [IQR 203 461C535 188] antibody units [AU] per mL) were higher than in 111 infection-naive health-care workers following one dose (35 001 [17 099C55 341] AU/mL; p<00001) and higher than in 25 infection-naive individuals given two doses (180 904 [108 221C242 467] AU/mL; p<00001). INTERPRETATION: A single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine is likely to provide greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, than in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals, including against variants of concern. Future studies should determine the additional benefit of a second dose on the magnitude and durability of immune responses in individuals vaccinated following infection, alongside evaluation of the impact of extending the interval between vaccine doses.

It has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and is a receptor for cyclosporin A (CsA). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases. In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"[Role of cyclophilin A during coronavirus replication and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infections are initiated by attachment of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral Spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on human host cells. This critical first step occurs in dynamic environments, where external forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play critical roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using magnetic tweezers and atomic force spectroscopy as highly complementary single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques, we investigate the RBD:ACE2 interaction over the whole physiologically relevant force range. We combine the experimental results with steered molecular dynamics simulations and observe and assign fully consistent unbinding and unfolding events across the three techniques, enabling us to establish ACE2 unfolding as a molecular fingerprint. Measuring at forces of 2-5 pN, we quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the RBD:ACE2 bond in equilibrium. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD:ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, larger binding free energy, and a lower dissociation rate in comparison to SARS-CoV-1, which helps to rationalize the different infection patterns of the two viruses. By studying how free ACE2 outcompetes tethered ACE2, we show that our assay is sensitive to prevention of bond formation by external binders.

Baseline assessment took place before the outbreak while a follow-up was performed immediately after the lockdown period. Multiple variables were investigated including age, gender, perceived life quality, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, coping strategies, central sensitization, pain intensity, pain-related disability and oral behaviour. COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were applied at follow-up to measure the extent of COVID-related distress. CSS were significantly higher in those with chronic TMDs compared to those with acute/subacute TMDs (p<0.05). In people with chronic TMD, the variation in anxiety and depression from baseline to follow-up was significantly correlated with scores on the CSS (r = 0.72; p = 0.002). Variations of the central sensitization inventory (r = 0.57; p = 0.020) and graded chronic pain scale (r = 0.59; p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with scores on the CSS.

In many adaptive designs, the conventional end-of-trial point estimates of the treatment effects are prone to bias, because they do not take into account the potential and realised trial adaptations. While much of the methodological developments on adaptive designs have tended to focus on control of type I error rates and power considerations, in contrast the question of biased estimation has received less attention. This article addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of proposed approaches to remove or reduce the potential bias in point estimation of treatment effects in an adaptive design, as well as illustrating how to implement them. We first discuss how bias can affect standard estimators and critically assess the negative impact this can have. We then describe and compare proposed unbiased and bias-adjusted estimators of treatment effects for different types of adaptive designs. Furthermore, we illustrate the computation of different estimators in practice using a real trial example.

Discussion: Previous reports have suggested coagulopathy with thrombotic signs as the main pathological feature of COVID-19, but no previous reports have focused on coagulopathy evaluated by whole-body enhanced CT scan. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers, represented by an increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, indicated that the essence of coagulopathy was massive fibrin formation. Although there were no clinical symptoms related to their prognosis, critical COVID-19-induced systemic thrombus formation was observed.

We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic. METHOD: Data collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019. RESULTS: During the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury.

Body condition was higher in 2020 than in all years since the inception of spring hunting in 1999, except for 2019. However, in 2020 geese reached maximal body condition earlier during the staging period than in any other year and reduced by half time spent feeding in highly profitable but risky agricultural habitat in late spring compared to 2019. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the effects of the lockdown, the associated reduction in disturbance in 2020 supports the hypothesis that hunting-related disturbance negatively affects foraging efficiency and body condition in geese. Since spring body condition is related to subsequent breeding success, the lockdown could increase productivity in this overabundant population.","output":"COVID19-induced reduction in human disturbance enhances fattening of an overabundant goose species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to global public health. Vaccination may be the most effective way to prevent and control the spread of the virus. The safety of vaccines is the focus of preclinical research, and the repeated dose toxicity test is the key safety test to evaluate the vaccine before clinical trials. The purpose of this study was (i) to observe the toxicity and severity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in rodent Sprague Dawley rats after multiple intramuscular injections under the premise of Good Laboratory Practice principles and (ii) to provide a basis for the formulation of a clinical trial scheme. The results showed that all animals in the experimental group were in good condition, no regular changes related to the vaccine were found in the detection of various toxicological indexes, and no noticeable stimulating reaction related to the vaccine was found in the injected local tissues. The neutralizing antibodies in the low- and high-dose vaccine groups began to appear 14 days after the last administration. In the negative control group, no neutralizing antibodies were observed from the administration period to the recovery period. Therefore, the repeated administration toxicity test of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero cells) in Sprague Dawley rats showed no obvious toxic reaction. It was preliminarily confirmed that the vaccine can stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies and is safe in Sprague Dawley rats.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (Vero cells) shows good safety in repeated administration toxicity test of Sprague Dawley rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many hospitals struggled to forecast bed capacity and the number of mechanical ventilators they needed to have available. Numerous epidemiological models forecast regional or national peak bed and ventilator needs, but these are not suitable for predictions at the hospital level. We developed an analytical model to assist hospitals in determining their census and ventilator requirements for COVID-19 patients during future periods of the pandemic, by using their data. This model is based on (1) projection of future daily admissions using counts from the previous seven days, (2) lengths of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, and (3) the percentage of inpatients requiring mechanical ventilation. The implementation is done within an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) workbook without the use of add-ins or macro programming. The model inputs for each currently hospitalized patient with COVID-19 are the duration of hospitalization, whether the patient is currently receiving or has previously received mechanical ventilation, and the duration of the current ventilation episode, if applicable. Data validity and internal consistency are checked within the workbook, and errors are identified. Durations of care (length of hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation) are generated by fitting a two-parameter Weibull distribution to the hospitals historical data from the initial phase of the pandemic (incorporating censoring due to ongoing care), for which we provide source code in the R programming language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Conditional distributions are then calculated using the hospitals current data. The output of the model is nearly instantaneous, producing an estimate of the census and the number of ventilators required in one, three, and seven days following the date on which the simulation is run. Given that the pandemic is ongoing, and a second surge of cases is expected with the reopening of the economy, having such a tool to predict resource needs for hospital planning purposes has been useful. A major benefit to individual hospitals from such modeling has been to provide reassurance to state and local governments that the hospitals have sufficient resources available to meet anticipated needs for new COVID-19 patients without having to set aside substantially greater numbers of beds or ventilators for such care. Such ongoing activity is important for the economic recovery of hospitals that have been hard-hit economically by the shutdown in elective surgery and other patient care activities.

METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85).

COVID-19 public health policies initially restricted all essential caregivers from visiting LTC homes. In lieu of in-person visitations, caregivers were allowed technology-based visits then restrictive outdoor visits, followed by indoor visitations. This study aims to illuminate the experiences of essential caregivers as they visited their loved ones in LTC during COVID-19s restrictive policies. We conducted seven caregiver focus groups (N=30) from Ontario and British Columbia, Canada. Thematic analysis and line-by-line coding were completed using NVivo. We found six themes that were common to all the visitation types: 1) LTC Home disorganization to facilitate visits and poor communication; 2) Lack of staffing and resources; 3) Mistreatment from staff and management as caregivers were seen as inconveniences; 4) Shock and disbelief when family members first saw their loved ones; 5) Significant lack of person-centered or family-centered ethos for example the residents needs were ignored such that their cognitive and physical impairments sometimes made visitations impossible, as well as the burden of multiple weekly COVID-19 tests; and, 6) Collateral damage in the form of trauma and irreparable harm to the relationships between residents and families. These results emphasized caregivers who ultimately felt betrayed and ignored by the broader healthcare system. Our findings provide an in-depth understanding of how COVID-19 public health policies have impacted the essential caregivers and the long-lasting impacts on residents and caregivers alike.

The biological vulnerability for these problems includes genetic factors involved in the regulation of the serotonergic system and stress system. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system that regulates the body's response to stress and has complex interactions with brain serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Corticotropin-releasing hormone and vasopressin act synergistically to stimulate the secretion of ACTH that stimulates the biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol. Cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues, including on mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors in the brain. Glucocorticoids produce behavioral changes, and one important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus, which is a major controlling center of the HPA axis. Stress plays a major role in the various pathophysiological processes associated with mood disorders and suicidal behavior. Serotonergic dysfunction is a well-established substrate for mood disorders and suicidal behavior. Corticosteroids may play an important role in the relationship between stress, mood changes and perhaps suicidal behavior by interacting with 5-HT1A receptors. Abnormalities in the HPA axis in response to increased levels of stress are found to be associated with a dysregulation in the serotonergic system, both in subjects with mood disorders and those who engage in suicidal behavior.

Each sample was tested for L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp.;confirmation was conducted via whole genome sequencing and PCR amplification of the sigB gene, respectively. A 117-question survey was developed based on previous work in retail deli departments and distributed to store or deli managers once during sampling. Survey questions were correlated with L. monocytogenes using linear regression and ANOVA statistical models. A Firth's bias-corrected logistic regression model was developed to predict the probability of a deli having high L. monocytogenes prevalence (>10%). L. monocytogenes prevalence decreased from 5.8% prior to March 2020 to 4.3% during the pandemic. Squeegees and standing water had the highest L. monocytogenes prevalence of all sampling sites in the study;L. monocytogenes was not found on scales or trash cans.

We aimed to discern the cumulative effect profile of PM exposure, and investigate the presence of mortality displacement in a large-scale population. METHODS: We conducted a time-series analysis with different exposure-lag models on 13 cities in Jiangsu, China, to estimate the effects of PM pollution on non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality (2015-2019). Over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive models were integrated with distributed lag models to estimate cumulative exposure effects, and assess mortality displacement. RESULTS: Pooled cumulative effect estimates with lags of 0-7 and 0-14 days were substantially larger than those with single-day and 2-day moving average lags. For each 10 g/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration with a cumulative lag of 0-7 days, we estimated an increase of 0.50 % (95 % CI: 0.29, 0.72), 0.63 % (95 % CI: 0.38, 0.88), and 0.50 % (95 % CI: 0.01, 1.01) in pooled estimates of non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively.

More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current theories for the development of IBD favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine IBD. Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.).

All studies are comparative retrospective or prospective human adult studies in peer-reviewed journals describing at least one intra-operative intervention designed to decrease the rate of seroma formation in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. RESULTS The database searches identified 3762 citations, and 21 studies were included for final analysis. Five studies compared the different methods of mesh fixation, nine studies compared primary defect closure (PFC) and bridged repair, two studies compared the effect of different types of meshes, two studies looked into the use of electrical cauterization, one study compared single- site laparoscopy with conventional laparoscopy, one study looked into the use of fibrin sealant and one study compared transabdominal preperitoneal placement of mesh with conventional repair. PFC appears to be the most promising with large studies showing a low rate of seroma formation with additional benefits of decreasing wound infection and recurrence rate. Cauterisation of hernia sac and injection of fibrin sealant also show promising results but are mainly derived from small studies. Other strategies did not demonstrate benefit. CONCLUSION Currently, primary fascial closure appears to be the most promising strategy available to decrease seroma formation after LVHR based on the results of large studies. Other promising strategies that decrease dead space such as cauterisation of the sac and fibrin sealant injection will require further multicentre trials to confirm benefit before an increase in operative time and cost can be justified for their routine use.","output":"Seroma prevention strategies in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) merupakan penyakit pandemi yang dapat menyebabkan komplikasi tromboemboli sebagai akibat terjadinya koagulopati dengan insidensi sekitar 16.5-21%.

Data were derived from a nationwide health insurance database. Analysis was performed from March 15 to September 30 and compared the years 2019 and 2020. Effects on mortality and adverse allograft events were compared with COVID-19-attributed effects. Results A total of 7725 patients were included in the final analysis. Admissions declined in 2020 by 17%, with the main dip during a 3-month lockdown (-31%) but without a subsequent rebound. Incidences for hospitalization did not increase for any investigated disease entities, whereas decreasing trends were noted for non-COVID-19 pulmonary and urogenital infections (incidence rate ratio 0.8, 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.03, and 0.82, 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.04, respectively).

METHOD Taking advantage of an ongoing weekly Internet survey monitoring living conditions of the French population during the containment, we introduced questions on alcohol and tobacco use 1 month after the start of the first containment. Analyses were conducted with multivariate Poisson regressions. RESULTS Tobacco consumption remained almost unchanged. By contrast, more than a third of French people did change their weekly alcohol intake: 13% increased it, whereas 21% decreased it, indicating that the containment measures were often taken as an opportunity to reduce alcohol consumption, especially among those who drank less than 4 days per week before. Men were more likely to decrease their alcohol intake and less likely to increase it than women, probably because of a differential impact of the reduction of social activities on gendered social roles. The people most affected were smokers and those living in a dwelling in which someone had been infected, including themselves.

The kitten was treated empirically with intramuscular atropine and dexamethasone, and rectal diazepam. The history of insecticide exposure was obtained after 6 h of treatment and intramuscular 2-pyridine aldoxime methochloride (pralidoxime [2-PAM]) and atropine therapy was started 2 h later. Recovery was complicated by suspected aspiration, but there were no sequelae from the insecticide exposure and by 7 days post-ingestion the kitten was normal and playful. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of successful management of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin toxicosis in a cat in Bangladesh. This case report suggests that 2-PAM followed by atropine and other supportive therapy may be an effective strategy to manage a cat poisoned by chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin; however, expanded clinical trials are needed.","output":"Successful management of a kitten with chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin toxicosis with pralidoxime and atropine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research suggests that racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 in the US are largely driven by higher rates of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among Hispanic/Latino and Black populations.

At a national-level, workers categorized as essential and high-risk are disproportionately Hispanic/Latino, but we lack analysis examining local-level racial/ethnic disparities in potential occupational exposures. Using the 2015C2019 5-year American Community Survey, we estimated disparities between the proportion of US Born Hispanic/Latino, foreign-born Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic white (NHW) essential or high-risk workers in 27 of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. We found that, on average, 66.3%, 69.9%, and 62.6% of US-born Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics, and NHW, respectively, are essential workers, while 50.7%, 49.9%, 49.5% are high exposure risk workers, respectively. The median absolute difference in proportions of US born Hispanic/Latino and NHW essential workers was 4.2%, and between foreign-born Hispanic/Latino and NHW essential workers was 7.5%, but these disparities varied widely by city. High likelihood of occupational transmission may help explain disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality for Hispanic/Latino populations, especially foreign-born, and may also help explain heterogeneity in the magnitude of these disparities, with relevance for other acute infectious respiratory illnesses spread in the workplace.","output":"Racial and ethnic inequities in occupational exposure across and between US cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study unique blended biopolymer mycocel from naturally derived biomass was developed.

The main objective of this study was to determine whether preemptive intravenous ganciclovir increases the number of ventilator-free days in patients with CMV blood reactivation. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involved 19 ICUs in France. Seventy-six adults  18 years old who had been mechanically ventilated for at least 96 h, expected to remain on mechanical ventilation for  48 h, and exhibited reactivation of CMV in blood were enrolled between February 5th, 2014, and January 23rd, 2019. Participants were randomized to receive ganciclovir 5 mg/kg bid for 14 days (n = 39) or a matching placebo (n = 37). RESULTS: The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days from randomization to day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes included day 60 mortality. The trial was stopped for futility based on the results of an interim analysis by the DSMB. The subdistribution hazard ratio for being alive and weaned from mechanical ventilation at day 60 for patients receiving ganciclovir (N = 39) compared with control patients (N = 37) was 1.14 (95% CI from 0.63 to 2.06; P = 0.66). The median [IQR] numbers of ventilator-free days for ganciclovir-treated patients and controls were 10 [0C51] and 0 [0C43] days, respectively (P = 0.46). Mortality at day 60 was 41% in patients in the ganciclovir group and 43% in the placebo group (P = .845). Creatinine levels and blood cells counts did not differ significantly between the two groups.

A potent RTX cytotoxin with broad cellular specificity may play a role in disrupting the epithelial barrier and facilitating invasion of the bloodstream, possibly in concert with a viral coinfection. Once in the bloodstream, the organism can disseminate to sites of invasive disease, primarily the joints, bones, and endocardium. Survival in the bloodstream and dissemination are likely aided by expression of a capsular polysaccharide and an exopolysaccharide galactan. The evidence for antigenic diversity of K. kingae surface exposed protein epitopes and the observation that type IV pili are selected against during invasive disease suggest that immune system pressure plays an important role in K. kingae pathogenicity.","output":"Pathogenesis of Kingella kingae Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the world with health and economic wreckage. Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients past medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHOs architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients pre-COVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.","output":"Individualized prediction of COVID-19 adverse outcomes with MLHO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importance An outbreak of multiple sclerosis (MS) is defined as symptoms and neurological signs typical of demyelinating disease, with a duration of at least 24 hours It appears in all forms of MS, contributing to short and long term disability The main treatments for outbreaks are high dose steroids given intravenously or orally for 3-5 days In our clinical practice, we used oral prednisone 1400 mg for 5 days prepared in a hospital pharmacy to avoid staff attendance at health centres Aim and objectives To evaluate oral prednisone effectiveness as a treatment for acute MS outbreaks Material and methods This was a retrospective multidisciplinary study, from March to June 2020 (4 months), during the limited mobility period due to the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) The results of 31 patients were analysed The following data were collected: sex, age, type of MS, expanded disability status scale (EDSS), treatment at the time of the outbreak, symptoms and evolution The programmes used were: patient medical history (DIRAYA), outpatient dispensing (DOMINION) and MRI (CARESTREAM) Specialist role was: the neurologist made the clinical evaluation, the pharmacist prepared the prednisone capsules from original tablets and its dispensation, and the nurse provided patient education Results 31 patients (25 women) with a mean age of 44 85 13 years were assessed Every patient had a diagnosis of recurrent remitting MS Treatments were: interferon beta (20), dimethyl fumarate (10) and cladribine (1) The mean EDSS was 3 The main symptoms were: paraesthesias, muscle weakness and urinary incontinence The EDSS progressed positively: 83 78% of patients evolved favourably, a subjective decrease in paraesthesia and weakness was observed and MRI showed less inflammation signs Another aspect was the comfort of the patient in carrying out this treatment at home rather than attending hospital Conclusion and relevance The results suggested that 1400 mg of oral prednisone administration for 5 days could be considered a safe, effective and comfortable alternative treatment for acute outbreaks of MS Multidisciplinary care is essential to obtain better clinical results","output":"Home management of acute multiple sclerosis outbreak: Adaptation to coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is one of the main viruses responsible of acute encephalitis.

We aimed to describe the clinical features of VZV encephalitis in the ICU and to identify factors associated with a favorable neurologic outcome. We performed a multicenter cohort study of patients with VZV encephalitis admitted in 18 ICUs in France between 2000 and 2017. Factors associated with a favorable neurologic outcome, defined by a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0-2 1 year after ICU admission, were identified by multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (29 (53%) men, median age 53 (interquartile range 36-66)) were included, of whom 43 (78%) were immunocompromised. ICU admission occurred 1 (0-3) day after the onset of neurological symptoms. Median Glasgow Coma Score at ICU admission was 12 (7-14). Cerebrospinal fluid examination displayed a median leukocyte count of 68 (13-129)/mm3, and a median protein level of 1.37 (0.77-3.67) g/L. CT scan and MRI revealed brain lesions in 30% and 66% of the cases, respectively. Invasive mechanical ventilation was implemented in 46 (84%) patients for a median duration of 13 (3-30) days. Fourteen (25%) patients died in the ICU. One year after ICU admission, 20 (36%) patients had a favorable neurologic outcome (mRS 0-2), 12 (22%) had significant disability (mRS 3-5), and 18 (33%) were deceased (lost to follow-up n = 5, 9%).

From our work with frontline healthcare clinicians and other caregiver populations, we offer recommendations for adapting the delivery, modality, and content of mind-body practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest key skills for promoting resiliency and buffering against the future stressors that lie ahead for everyone.","output":"Responding to COVID-19 Stress: Disseminating Mind-Body Resiliency Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The use of laparoscopy in resource-restricted countries has increased in recent years. Although simulation is now considered an important adjunct to operating-room-based training for learning laparoscopic skills, there is very little literature assessing the use of simulation in resource-restricted countries. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and impact of a 3-day Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) course in Botswana, Africa. METHODS A total of 20 surgeons and trainees participated in a 3-day FLS course. A pretest FLS score was obtained for each subject, followed by 2 days of practice with feedback. A final FLS posttest score was then obtained. Participants also watched the FLS instructional CD-ROM and took the written test on day 3. RESULTS Mean posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores for each FLS task and for the total normalized FLS simulator score (285 +/- 94 versus 132 +/- 92, p < 0.001). The mean score on the written test was 242 (116). In total, only two surgeons achieved a passing score on both the cognitive and skills assessment required to obtain FLS certification. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first time the FLS program has been taught in Africa. We have shown that giving the FLS course in a resource-restricted country is feasible and resulted in a significant improvement in FLS technical skills after 3 days. Most surgeons, however, still did not reach FLS passing scores, indicating that more than 3 days will be required in future courses to help surgeons obtain FLS certification.","output":"Surgical simulation in Africa: the feasibility and impact of a 3-day fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery course."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy, such as leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds, and cavernomas. Cystlike lesions have been rarely described and characterized in the literature. We aimed to characterize cystlike lesions, their risk factors, and association with other late adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Children treated for brain tumors during a 30-year period (n = 139) were included. We documented imaging findings, focusing on cystlike lesion development and its relationship with clinical history and other imaging findings. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS Cystlike lesions developed in 16.5% of patients treated with radiotherapy, with a median of 2 years until the development of the first lesion. For every 4-year age increase, there were 50% decreased odds of developing lesions and a 50% decrease in the average count of lesions. Females demonstrated a 4.00 rate ratio of developing a higher number of lesions. Patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy had 3.20 increased odds of developing cystlike lesions compared with patients with radiation therapy alone. A larger proportion of patients treated with methotrexate (25%) developed cystlike lesions, but this was not statistically significant. Cystlike lesions tended to develop in cerebral locations where leukoencephalopathy was worse. A strong relationship was found between the development of cystlike lesions and leukoencephalopathy severity. CONCLUSIONS Cystlike lesions are frequent and under-reported late adverse effects of cranial radiation therapy in children. Younger age, chemoradiotherapy, and the severity of leukoencephalopathy represent risk factors for the development of cystlike lesions.","output":"Cystlike Lesions as a Late Sequela of Radiotherapy in Pediatric Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As statins decrease the progression of sepsis and its related mortality, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on survival and symptom improvement in hospitalized patients with COVID\\\\19.

This study examined patterns of self-reported health service utilization, their socio-demographic determinants and association with avoidable deaths during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted between March 22 and April 1, 2020, during the peak rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents over 18-years-old were recruited using a computerised random digital dialling (RDD) system. The RDD method used stratified random sampling to ensure a representative sample of the target population by age, gender, and residential district. A structured self-reported questionnaire was used. RESULTS Out of 1738 placed calls, 765 subjects responded to the questionnaire (44.0% response rate). The factors associated with avoiding medical consultation included being female (37.2% vs. 22.5%, P<.001), married (32.8% vs. 27%, P=.044), completing tertiary education (35.3% vs. 27.7% (secondary) vs. 14.8% (primary), P=.005), and those who reported a \\"large/very large\\" impact of COVID-19 on their mental health (36.1% vs 30.5% (neutral) vs. 19.7% (very small/small), P=.047) using logistic regression analysis.

Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. METHODS: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. RESULTS: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.","output":"A novel pseudovirus-based mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to test COVID-19 interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the abilities of cDNA probes from the 5 and 3 ends of the genome of human rhinoviruses (HRV-) 14, 9, and 1B to detect RNA from 59 rhinovirus serotypes.

METHODS With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference. Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7). RESULTS We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually. CONCLUSIONS While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia.","output":"Webinars reduce the environmental footprint of pediatric cardiology conferences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning has become a practical method in the teaching and learning process, especially during the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.

To fight the pandemic, there is an immense need for effective vaccines. The purposes of our study were to investigate the effect of coronavirus vaccines on seizures in people with epilepsy (PWE) and assess the adverse events of COVID-19 vaccine in PWE. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. We included epilepsy patients who got vaccinated with two or three doses at least 1 month earlier. We gathered the data using a standardized form. The form contained questions about patients demographic features, clinical features, and information about the vaccination and its adverse events. The questionnaire included questions about epilepsy-related adverse events. RESULTS: We included 178 people with epilepsy in our study. The frequency of adverse events was lower than clinical studies of the vaccines. The mean number of seizures in the month before the vaccination was 1.62, between the doses was 1.61, and after vaccination was 1.64. There was no significant difference in the number of monthly seizures before the vaccination, the month between the doses, or the month after the vaccination (p = 0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The vaccines under consideration in our study were tolerated well by the epilepsy patients. The vaccines did not affect the monthly number of seizures of the PWE. A small number of patients had more seizures than normal after vaccination.

The largest decrease was in the sum parameter \\"all PA\\" (MET (metabolic equivalent of task)-min/week, ?p2 = 0.903; min/week, ?p2 = 0.861). Daily sitting time increased from 2.7 to 5.0 h per weekday (p < 0.001, ?p2 = 0.669). For gender, continent, country, level of handball league, and playing position, no significant differences (group and interaction effects) were observed. The largest change in PA behavior was in walking (minutes per day: ?p2 = 0.755), with males displaying the greatest decrease (from 62  11 to 30  14 min per weekday; d = 2.67). In terms of magnitude, difference between genders was greatest for sitting time (difference in d = 1.20). In conclusion, while COVID-19 measures were essential to preserve public health, PA was compromised and sedentary behavior increased because of these public health measures regardless of gender, playing position, and competition level.","output":"Effects of Home Confinement on the Intensity of Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Team Handball According to Country, Gender, Competition Level, and Playing Position: A Worldwide Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"None","output":"Lung transplantation in the COVID-19 Era: A multi-faceted challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, have proven to be a source of energy to households, transportation and power industries over the past decades. This natural reserve is diminishing at an alarming rate with crude oil having reserves to last the earth for the next half a century. As a result, researchers are constantly seeking remedial technologies to close this gap. Thermochemical conversion processes such as pyrolysis, gasification and liquefaction (PGL) offer an alternative solution to mitigating the world's high reliance on crude oil. These processes can be employed to provide energy, fuel and high-end value-added products. This paper aims to highlight all the research and development advancements and trends that have been made over the past three decades while employing waste tyres and other feedstock. In addition, the prominent countries and their associated researchers who have made novel discoveries in the field of thermochemical conversion are extensively discussed. The research findings show that significant research outputs such as the utilization of vast types of feed materials, the reaction mechanisms, the factors affecting the processes, and the application of the different end-products for thermochemical processes are well documented in the literature. Also, the collected data showed that significant advancements have been achieved in developing PGL technologies. The following conclusions were drawn: (i) PGL technologies show a generally increasing percentage interest from 1990 to 2020, (ii) many authors have identified the end-products obtained from waste feedstocks, such as; waste tyres, biomass, plastics, food waste, microalgae and animal manure to yield promising application benefits, (iii) China has shown the greatest interest in investing into waste to energy initiatives and has demonstrated the vast applications of waste derived products and, (iv) employing waste tyres as a feedstock has shown potential for producing high-end value products in their crude form or refined form. Some of the shortcomings identified during the study are the modest interest shown by most African regions as well as the lack of regulatory frameworks developed by certain countries.","output":"Developments in waste tyre thermochemical conversion processes: gasification, pyrolysis and liquefaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated adverse drug events (ADEs) by chart review in a random national sample of 428 veterans with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who received tocilizumab (n = 173 of 428).

In Study 1, data from Ireland (N = 1276) showed that pandemic threat predicted increased national identification, which in turn predicted authoritarianism. In Study 2, we replicated this indirect effect in a representative UK sample (N = 506). In Study 3, we used an alternative measure of authoritarianism and conceptually replicated this effect among USA citizens (N = 429).

In 2009-2011, an influenza pandemic occurred, with pH1N1 infecting millions of people worldwide. Here, we have used novel bioinformatic methods to combine clinical, protein biomarker, and genomic data from patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory failure to identify three mechanistically discrete sub-types with significantly different clinical outcomes. The three endotypes identified can be described as neutrophil-driven (16.3%), adaptive (51.9%), and endothelial leak (31.7%). The neutrophil driven patients display evidence of innate immune activation with associated multi-organ dysfunction and reduced 30-day survival. These patients could be differentiated from the adaptive endotype by an alteration in the GAIT-mechanism, a late transcriptional regulatory response to IFN-gamma; that acts to suppress innate immunity by reducing caeruloplasmin mRNA translation. Patients with the neutrophil-driven endotype had significantly increased IFN-gamma; levels but appeared unable to suppress their innate immune response. The endothelial leak endotype could be distinguished from both the neutrophil driven and adaptive endotypes by alterations in Slit-Robo signalling, a pathway important in the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity; Although patients with this endotype required mechanical ventilation, they did not develop multi-organ failure in the manner of the neutrophil-driven endotype patients, and had significantly better clinical outcomes. Importantly, the endotypes identified were stable over 48 hours opening up the possibility of stratified interventional clinical trials in the future.","output":"Identification of novel mechanistically distinct endotypes of pandemic influenza-associated acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Device-based interventions to lower drug-resistant hypertension have made the management of this disorder more complicated. In this review, we will focus on developments in this approach to blood pressure care which have appeared over the last year in a published or abstract form. RECENT FINDINGS Much of the recent literature in this area is characterized by very large office systolic blood pressure reductions, on the order of 25 mmHg at 6 months after intervention. However, the largest and the most rigorously conducted trial of renal denervation failed to meet its efficacy endpoint. We will review some speculations on why that may have occurred. SUMMARY There is little guidance for the management of drug-resistant hypertension in existing guidelines due largely to an absence of clinical trials with hard cardiovascular outcomes; thus, most of the literature relies on short-term (generally less than 1 year) studies that are oriented toward efficacy (i.e., blood pressure reduction per se). With the failure of the Symplicity HTN3 trial to meet its efficacy endpoint, the entire field of renal denervation is under careful scrutiny. From this reviewer's perspective, this finding seems to be more of a speed-bump than a 'road closed' sign for renal denervation, a prompt to reconsider the adequacy of denervation techniques and an encouragement to continue the search for robust predictors of clinical response.","output":"Interventional management in hypertension: where do we stand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tens of thousands of children living on Mainland China cross the border between Shenzhen and Hong Kong for a ?better education? every day.

Though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults, the Indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution, malnutrition and poor access to medical care. We aimed to quantify the potential impact of COVID-19 on Indias child population. Methods: We combined district family household survey data with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China to analyze the potential impact of COVID-19 on children under the age of 5, under three different scenarios; each of which assumed the prevalence of infection to be 0.5%, 1%, or 5%. Results: We find that in the lowest prevalence scenario, across the most populous 18 Indian states, asymptomatic, non-hospitalized symptomatic and hospitalized symptomatic cases could reach 87,200, 412,900 and 31,900, respectively. In a moderate prevalence scenario, these figures reach 174,500, 825,800, and 63,800, and in the worst case, high prevalence scenario these cases could climb as high as 872,200, 4,128,900 and 319,700.

However, the effects of semen swim-up (S-SU), pellet swim-up (P-SU), density gradient (DG) and DG followed by SU (DG/SU) on sperm motility, morphology, DNA fragmentation, acrosome reaction, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial activity were not fully understood. OBJECTIVES To study the impact of four sperm preparation techniques on sperm functional parameters MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 60 infertile men with a minimum sperm concentration of 20 x 106 /ml and total sperm motility of  30%. Each raw semen sample was divided into four aliquots. Each aliquot was prepared by one of the tested techniques. Various sperm characteristics were assessed before and after sperm preparation. RESULTS DG and DG/SU resulted in significantly higher DNA fragmentation percentages compared to S-SU (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) and P-SU (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Significantly higher percentages of sperm with intact acrosome were detected in S-SU (p<0.001) and P-SU (p<0.001) compared to raw semen. The percentage of ROS positive spermatozoa was significantly higher after P-SU (p<0.001), DG (p<0.001) and DG/SU (p<0.001) than raw semen. In addition, the percentages of 100 % stained midpiece (active mitochondria) were significantly higher in S-SU (p<0.001) and P-SU (p<0.001) compared to raw semen. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report comparing the impact of these techniques on various sperm functional parameters. S-SU was more effective than DG in selecting better spermatozoa in terms of DNA integrity, ROS levels, acrosome status and mitochondrial activity. Randomized clinical trials comparing these four techniques are required to test their impact on embryo development and pregnancy outcomes.","output":"Differential impact of four sperm preparation techniques on sperm motility, morphology, DNA fragmentation, acrosome status, oxidative stress and mitochondrial activity: a prospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic affects mortality directly through infection as well as through changes in the social, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. The impacts on mortality are likely to vary, in both magnitude and timing, by age and sex. Our aim was to estimate the total mortality impacts of the pandemic, by sex, age group and week. Methods: We developed an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models that probabilistically estimate the weekly number of deaths that would be expected had the Covid-19 pandemic not occurred. The models account for seasonality of death rates, medium-long-term trends in death rates, the impact of temperature on death rates, association of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s), and the impact of bank holidays. We used data from January 2010 through mid-February 2020 (i.e., week starting 15th February 2020) to estimate the parameters of each model, which was then used to predict the number of deaths for subsequent weeks as estimates of death rates if the pandemic had not occurred. We subtracted these estimates from the actual reported number of deaths to measure the total mortality impact of the pandemic. Results: In the week that began on 21st March, the same week that a national lockdown was put in place, there was a >92% probability that there were more deaths in men and women aged []45 years than would occur in the absence of the pandemic; the probability was 100% from the subsequent week. Taken over the entire period from mid-February to 8th May 2020, there were an estimated [~] 49,200 (44,700-53,300) or 43% (37-48) more deaths than would be expected had the pandemic not taken place. 22,900 (19,300-26,100) of these deaths were in females (40% (32-48) higher than if there had not been a pandemic), and 26,300 (23,800-28,700) in males (46% (40-52) higher). The largest number of excess deaths occurred among women aged >85 years (12,400; 9,300-15,300), followed by men aged >85 years (9,600; 7,800-11,300) and 75-84 years (9,000; 7,500-10,300). The cause of death assigned to the majority (37,295) of these excess deaths was Covid-19. There was nonetheless a >99.99% probability that there has been an increase in deaths assigned to other causes in those aged []45 years. However, by the 8th of May, the all-cause excess mortality had become virtually equal to deaths assigned to Covid-19, and non-Covid excess deaths had diminished to close to zero, or possibly become negative, in all age-sex groups. Interpretation: The death toll of Covid-19 pandemic, in middle and older ages, is substantially larger than the number of deaths reported as a result of confirmed infection, and was visible in vital statistics when the national lockdown was put in place. When all-cause mortality is considered, the mortality impact of the pandemic on men and women is more similar than when comparing deaths assigned to Covid-19 as underlying cause of death.","output":"Age- and sex-specific total mortality impacts of the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic in England and Wales: Application of a Bayesian model ensemble to mortality statistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 has been shown to be having a disproportionate impact on the health of individuals from different ethnic groups and those employed in certain occupations, whilst the indirect impacts of Covid-19, including the closure of schools and business and the move to home working, fall disproportionately on the young and on women. These factors may in turn impact upon sleep health. Research on sleep deprivation during the pandemic crisis to date has been limited. The present study aimed to explore the levels and social determinants of self-reported sleep loss among the general population during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, with a particular focus on ethnic and gender disparities. Methods: Newly available national representative survey data from Understanding Society COVID19 Study collected during April 2020 were analysed. These data were linked to Wave 9 of Understanding Society conducted in 2018/19, providing information about the respondents prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Cross-sectional analysis provided prevalence estimates, whilst analysis of the linked longitudinal data provided incidence estimates. The analytical sample included 15,360 respondents aged 16 and above; among these, 12,206 reported no problem of sleep loss before the epidemic. Results: Prevalence and incidence rates of perceived sleep loss were 24.7% and 20.2% respectively. Women (at the level of 31.8% and 27.0%) and individuals from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities (at the level of 32.0% and 24.6%) were more vulnerable to sleep deprivation due to the pandemic. Multivariate regression analysis shows that being female, the presence of young children in the household, perceived financial difficulties and being a Covid-19-related key worker were all predictive of sleep loss. Once these covariates were controlled for the bivariate relationship between ethnicity and sleep loss was reversed, reflecting the complex interaction between the coronavirus epidemic and ethnicity. Conclusions: The pandemic has widened the disparity of sleep deprivation across different groups, with women with young children, key workers and people of BAME heritage all experiencing difficulty in sleeping, which in turn may negatively affect mental and physical health and well-being.","output":"Sleepless in Lockdown: unpacking differences in sleep loss during the coronavirus pandemicin the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the recent advent of highly effective direct-acting antivirals. The envelope glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with cell-entry receptors. However, there is no approved therapeutic targeting this potentially druggable biomarker. Methods The anti-HCV activity of AvFc was evaluated through the use of in vitro neutralization assays as well as an in vivo challenge in the PXB chimeric human liver mouse model. Drug toxicity was assessed by histopathology, serum ALT, and mouse body weights. Results AvFc was capable of neutralizing cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype-independent manner, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Systemic administration of AvFc in a histidine-based buffer was well tolerated; after 11 doses every other day at 25 mg/kg there were no significant changes in body or liver weights or in blood human albumin or serum ALT activity. Gross necropsy and liver pathology confirmed the lack of toxicity. This regimen successfully prevented genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity failed.

Therefore, pharmacologic treatment strategies to improve bone quality are commonly pursued in osteoporotic cases before conducting spinal fusions. The two most commonly used pharmacotherapeutics are bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs. Evidence indicates that using bisphosphonates and PTH analogs, alone or in combination, in osteoporotic patients undergoing spinal fusion, decreases complication rates and improves clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to develop guidelines for the administration of bisphosphonates and PTH analogs in osteoporotic spinal fusion patients in terms of treatment duration, potential benefits of sequential use, and the selection of either therapeutic agents based on patient characteristics.","output":"Bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone analogs for improving bone quality in spinal fusion: State of evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exhaled breath samples had the highest positive rate (26.9%, n=52), followed by surface swabs (5.4%, n=242), and air samples (3.8%, n=26).

In the US state of Indiana, an estimated 6.3 million people are living with one or more chronic illnesses, a large proportion of them reside in rural areas where there is limited access to palliative care leading to major healthcare inequities and disparities. This study aims to identify common barriers and facilitators to access palliative care services in rural areas of Indiana from the perspectives of healthcare providers including clinicians, educators, and community stakeholders. Using a community-based participatory approach, a purposive sample of palliative care providers (n = 15) in rural areas of Indiana was obtained. Penchansky and Thomas (1981) theoretical framework of access was used to guide the study. A semi-structured individual in-depth interview guide was used to collect the data. All the interviews were conducted online, audio-recorded, and transcribed. Barriers to palliative care include: misconceptions about palliative care as an underrecognized specialty; lack of trained palliative care providers; late involvement of inpatient palliative care and community hospice services; inadequate palliative care education and training; financial barriers, attitudes and beliefs around PC; and geographical barriers. Facilitators to palliative care include financial gains supporting palliative care growth, enhanced nurses role in identifying patients with palliative care needs and creating awareness and informing the community about palliative care. Robust education and awareness, enhancing advanced practice nurses roles, increasing funding and resources are essential to improve the access of palliative care services in the rural communities of Indiana.","output":"Palliative care for rural growth and wellbeing: identifying perceived barriers and facilitators in access to palliative care in rural Indiana, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pneumonia represents a global threatening disease, especially in severe cases.

We present a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital. For a range of basic reproductive numbers (R(0)) corresponding to conditions in different cities (but with emphasis on R(0) approximately 3 as reported for Hong Kong and Singapore), we evaluate contact precautions and case management (quarantine and isolation) as containment measures. Hospital-based contact precautions emerge as the most potent measures, with hospital-wide measures being particularly important if screening of HCWs is inadequate. For R(0) = 3, case isolation alone can control a SARS outbreak only if isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four and the mean symptom-onset-to-isolation time is less than 3 days. Delays of a few days in contact tracing and case identification severely degrade the utility of quarantine and isolation, particularly in high-transmission settings. Still more detrimental are delays between the onset of an outbreak and the implementation of control measures; for given control scenarios, our model identifies windows of opportunity beyond which the efficacy of containment efforts is reduced greatly. By considering pathways of transmission in our system, we show that if hospital-based transmission is not halted, measures that reduce community-HCW contact are vital to preventing a widespread epidemic.

Because it is a life-threatening condition, rapid diagnosis is necessary to prevent acute complications. Diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis are elevated serum creatine kinase, liver enzyme levels, and myalgia. Rhabdomyolysis can easily be missed in patients with COVID-19. Herein, we report the case of a female with rhabdomyolysis as a manifestation of acute COVID-19. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old female was found to have rhabdomyolysis associated with COVID-19. Her creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels were significantly elevated. Ringer's lactate infusion was administered at a controlled rate to treat the rhabdomyolysis along with boluses of normal saline, with close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and kidney function. The patient's creatine kinase and liver enzyme levels peaked on Day 2 and then decreased. Her medical condition improved, and she was discharged on Day 4. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the need to monitor the creatine kinase level of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Fluid management can be challenging in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to COVID-19 because of the risk of fluid overload and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

While school feeding programs are ubiquitous in LMICs, the specific benefits of school feeding programs are unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the impacts of school feeding programs on the educational and health outcomes of children and adolescents in LMICs. METHODS Rigorously designed interventional studies on the impacts of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs will be included. The following information sources were used to identify relevant published or unpublished studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and governmental or organizational websites. The risk of bias of randomized and non-randomized studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the ROBINS-I tool, respectively. Two reviewers will independently conduct the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis of all the included studies will be provided. Meta-analyses will be performed whenever appropriate. Heterogeneity of effects will be assessed by I2, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression. The certainty of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DISCUSSION The design and implementation of school feeding programs in LMICs should be based on the understanding of the benefits of such programs.

We aimed to analyze the association of Crs with outcome in COVID-19-associated ARDS, to ascertain its determinants and to describe its evolution at day-14. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, Crs was measured at day-1 and day-14. Association between Crs or Crs/ideal body weight (IBW) and breathing without assistance at day-28 was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Determinants were ascertained by multivariable linear regression. Day-14 Crs was compared to day-1 Crs with paired t-test in patients still under controlled mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The mean Crs in 372 patients was 37.6  13 mL/cmH(2)O, similar to as in ARDS of other causes. Multivariate linear regression identified chronic hypertension, low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, low PEEP, and low tidal volume as associated with lower Crs/IBW. After adjustment on confounders, nor Crs [OR 1.0 (CI 95% 0.98C1.02)] neither Crs/IBW [OR 0.63 (CI 95% 0.13C3.1)] were associated with the chance of breathing without assistance at day-28 whereas plateau pressure was [OR 0.93 (CI 95% 0.88C0.99)]. In a subset of 108 patients, day-14 Crs decreased compared to day-1 Crs (31.2  14.4 mL/cmH(2)O vs 37.8  11.4 mL/cmH(2)O, p < 0.001). The decrease in Crs was not associated with day-28 outcome. CONCLUSION: In a large multicenter cohort of moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS, mean Crs was decreased below 40 mL/cmH(2)O and was not associated with day-28 outcome. Crs decreased between day-1 and day-14 but the decrease was not associated with day-28 outcome.","output":"Static compliance of the respiratory system in COVID-19 related ARDS: an international multicenter study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the increase of temperature can influence the environmental endurance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods: We searched trials in seven electronic databases and two clinical trail registries. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy and safety of TGP for SLE were identified. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 was used for quality assessment of the included trials, and RevMan 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 14 RCTs were included, including 978 participants, 492 in the intervention group and 486 in the control group. Regarding the efficacy of TGP for SLE, results showed that TGP plus conventional treatments (CTs) was superior to CTs alone in reducing disease activity (MD SLEDAI-1m = -3.54, 95% CI = -4.08 to -3.00, p < 0.00001; MD SLEDAI-2m = -3.80, 95% CI = -4.51 to -3.09, p < 0.00001; MD SLEDAI-3m = -1.62, 95% CI = -2.60 to -0.64, p < 0.0001; MD SLEDAI-6m = -1.97, 95% CI = -3.18 to -0.76, p = 0.001). The results also showed that TGP contributed to a betterment in improving other outcomes related to lupus activity, such as ESR, CRP, complement proteins (C3, C4), and immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM). In addition, TGP significantly decreased average daily glucocorticoid dosage and cumulative cyclophosamide dosage, as well as disease recurrence rate. In terms of safety, TGP may reduce the incidence of adverse reactions (RR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.88, p = 0.01). The certainty of the evidence were assessed as moderate to low. Conclusion: TGP appears potentially effective and generally safe in reducing disease activity in SLE. However, in view of high risk of bias, the findings need to be confirmed in high-quality trials.

Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?, Are there repeated offenders?, and How are new crowd management measures performing?. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions.

When combining both CRP/L and NLPR for the prediction of poor outcome in adult cancer patients with COVID19, the sensitivity increased to 80% and the specificity was 70.7% (AUC 0.805, P = 0.027). Increased incidence of ICU admission in pediatric cancer patients associated significantly with the severity of covid19 infection, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) < 28.3, increased red cell distribution width (RDW) > 16, lymphopenia < 1.04, pseudo Pelger-Huet appearance, and PLR < 196.4 (P = 0.004, P = 0.040, P = 0.029, P = 0. 0.039, P = 0.050, and P = 0.040; respectively). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), MCH, and RDW could be useful prognostic markers for poor outcome in COVID-19 pediatric cancer patients (P < 0.05 for all).

Sources of information: Program-specific documents, preexisting, and related to COVID-19; documents from provincial, national, and international kidney transplant societies/agencies and organ procurement agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Challenges in the care of pediatric kidney transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) Pediatric Group. It identified pediatric kidney transplant nephrologists (including a pediatric nephrologist ethicist) across the country and formed a workgroup. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via e-mail and virtual meetings. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CST Kidney Transplant Working Group, by the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) COVID-19 Rapid Response Team (RRT), and an infectious disease expert. The suggestions were presented at an interactive webinar sponsored by CSN in collaboration with the CST and Canadian Association of Pediatric Nephrologists (CAPN), and attended by pediatric kidney health care professionals for further peer input. Final revisions were made based on feedback received. CJKHD editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: We identified 8 key areas of pediatric kidney transplant care that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) transplant activity, (2) outpatient clinic activity, (3) monitoring, (4) multidisciplinary care, (5) medications (immunosuppression and others), (6) patient/family education/support, (7) school and employment, and (8) management of pediatric kidney transplant patients who are COVID-19 positive. We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. Limitations: A full systematic review of available literature was not undertaken for the sake of expediency in development of this guideline. There is a paucity of literature to support evidence-based recommendations at this time. Instead, these guidelines were formulated based on expert opinion derived from available knowledge/experience and are subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. The parallel review process that was created to expedite the publication of this work may not be as robust as standard arms' length peer review processes. Implications: These recommendations are meant to serve as a guide to pediatric kidney transplant directors, clinicians, and administrators for providing the best patient care in the context of limited resources while protecting patients and health care providers wherever possible by limiting exposure to COVID-19. We recognize that recommendations may not be applicable to all provincial/local health authority practices and that they may not be delivered to all patients given the time and resource constraints affecting the individual provincial/local health jurisdiction.","output":"Management of Pediatric Kidney Transplant Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Guidance From the Canadian Society of Transplantation Pediatric Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of health systems in the management of disasters, including natural hazards like outbreaks and pandemics, is crucial and vital. Healthcare systems which are unprepared to properly deal with crises are much more likely to expose their public health workers and health personnel to harm and will not be able to deliver healthcare provisions in critical situations. This can lead to a drammatic toll of deaths, even in developed countries. The possible occurrence of global crises has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to devise instruments, guidelines and tools to assess the capacity of countries to deal with disasters. Irans health system has been hit hardly by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess its preparedness and response to the outbreak. METHODS: The present investigation was designed as a qualitative study. We utilized the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan devised by WHO as a conceptual framework. RESULTS: The dimension/pillar which scored the highest was national laboratories, followed by surveillance, rapid response teams and case investigations. Risk communication and community engagement was another pillar receiving a high score, followed by infection prevention and control and by country-level coordination, planning and monitoring. The pillars/dimensions receiving the lowest scores were operational support and logistics; case management; and points of entry. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has represented an unprecedent event that has challenged healthcare systems and facilities worldwide, highlighting their weaknesses and the need for inter-sectoral cooperation and collaboration during the crisis. Analyzing these experiences and capitalizing on them, by strengthening them,will help countries to be more prepared to face possible future crises.","output":"Assessing Irans health system according to the COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan of the World Health Organization: health policy and historical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.","output":"Antibody evasion by the P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns related to the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Norwegian population are studied in a cross-sectional web-survey conducted between 8 April and 20 May 2020.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server MedRxiv from their inception until May 11, 2020, using the terms anosmia or hyposmia or dysosmia or olfactory dysfunction or olfaction disorder or smell dysfunction or ageusia or hypogeusia or dysgeusia or taste dysfunction or gustatory dysfunction or neurological and COVID-19 or 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2. The references of included studies were also manually screened. Only studies involving patients with diagnostic-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with data from 8438 patients with test-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 13 countries were included. The pooled proportions of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction were 41.0% (95% CI, 28.5% to 53.9%) and 38.2% (95% CI, 24.0% to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = -0.076; P=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = -0.073; P=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared with self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; P=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by sex was observed. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19. Routine screening for these conditions could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs, but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. METHODS: We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic. In particular, we examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. RESULTS: A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production. However, it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners, hospitals or even whole public health systems, causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care.","output":"Influenza pandemic intervention planning using InfluSim: pharmaceutical and non- pharmaceutical interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India has seen a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths in early part of 2021, despite having controlled the epidemic during 2020.

Under all scenarios of immune evasion, we find an increased transmissibility advantage for B.1617.2 against all previously circulating strains. Using an extended SIR model accounting for reinfections and wanning immunity, we produce evidence in support of how early public interventions in March 2021 would have helped to control transmission in the country.

In the US, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients require transfusion support until engraftment and together with hematology/oncology (hemonc.) patients receive the highest number of PCs/patient. FDA's Guidance recommends approaches to reduce BC risk including the use of enhanced bacterial culture screening (EBSC) or pathogen reduction (PR) of platelets. Methods: The Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) implemented PR-PCs for all allogeneic HSCT patients. Irradiation, CMV testing, and bacterial screening have been discontinued for PR-PCs. Transfusion outcomes are being monitored using active hemovigilance (HV) reporting. Results: Considering the fatality risk associated with BC of PCs (1:200,000 -1:1,000,000) despite the use of optimal skin cleansing, initial sample diversion, and primary bacterial culture, 1/2,880 PCs are still contaminated (Bloch et al.);further steps towards BC mitigation are needed. As the UK and US reported a residual BC risk of 5.4-9.4/million PCs after implementation of EBSC, PR may represent an alternative approach with other cumulative benefits. Indeed, national HV data from France, Switzerland and Belgium reported no sepsis transfusion reactions since PR implementation (Benjamin et al.). In addition, the risk of TA-GVHD and other TTI including emerging infectious diseases (EID) may be decreased after the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes (Lanteri et al.). At MCI, the percentage of transfused PR-PCs has been increasing steadily from 7.9% in July 2019 to 22.2% in January 2021. Over a 19 monthperiod, a total of 9,296 PC were transfused including 1,677 PR-PCs. While non-PR-PCs were all irradiated and bacterially screened, PR-PC were neither irradiated nor bacterially screened. No cases of TA-GVHD or TTI were reported. A total of 27 mild, non-life-threatening platelet transfusion reactions were reported including 22 (81.5%) after non-PR PCs transfusion and 5 (18.5%) after PR-PC transfusion. In addition, the early release of transfusion-ready fresh PR-PCs 24-48 hours after collection has proven invaluable in providing clinicians and patients with blood continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Though certain measures have improved blood safety, the risk of TTI associated with PC transfusion remains a concern for vulnerable hemonc. patients.

The current study investigates the role of DNA methylation at FOXP3 Treg-cell-specific demethylated region (TSDR), as a marker of regulatory T (Treg) cells that are important negative regulators of inflammation, and the promoter of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) gene, an important pro-inflammatory cytokine, in relation to discrimination stress during pregnancy and depression and anxiety symptomatology. A sample of 148 Latina women residing in the US (mean age 27.6 years) were assessed prenatally at 24C32 weeks gestation and 4C6 weeks postnatally for perceived discrimination exposure (Everyday Discrimination Scale, EDS), emotional distress (depression, anxiety, perinatal-specific depression), acculturation, and acculturative stress. DNA methylation levels at the FOXP3 and TNF promoter regions from blood samples collected at the prenatal stage were assessed by bisulphite pyrosequencing. Regression analyses showed that prenatal EDS associated with postnatal emotional distress, depression and anxiety symptoms only in those individuals with higher than mean levels of FOXP3 TSDR and TNF promoter methylation; no such significant associations were found in those with lower than mean levels of methylation for either. We further found that these relationships were mediated by TNF only in those with high FOXP3 TSDR methylation, implying that immunosuppression via TNF promoter methylation buffers the impact of discrimination stress on postpartum symptomatology.

Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS: The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid.

The remaining users identified as radiation therapists (10%), dosimetrists (10%), medical physicists (8.7%), and medical students (6.6%). As of February 2021, a total of 65 cases have been developed covering 9 disease sites. The most commonly viewed disease site was head and neck (23% of all case views), followed by gynecological, gastrointestinal, and breast cancer. The most commonly viewed cases include pre-operative rectal cancer, head and neck organs-at-risk, and intact prostate cancer. Over 5 years, usage of eContour has increased both in terms of total users and case views. Total users have grown > 600% since 2017; 3,613 (2017), to 12,248 (2019), to 22,889 cumulative total users (2021). In the fourth quarter of 2020, eContour averaged 1,018 case views per weekday. Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, usage of eContour has accelerated. Annual case views increased 56% year-over-year from 2019 to 2020 (147,846 to 230,304 views) as compared to essentially stable from 2018 to 2019 (144,769 to 147,846). CONCLUSION With approximately 5,000 radiation oncologists in the US, we estimate 60% of US radiation oncologists are registered users. Growth in users and web site traffic over the first 5 years of eContour show its strong potential to increase the use of evidence-based contouring information at the point of care.","output":"Five-Year Development and Usage Outcomes of eContour, a Web-Based Interactive Contouring Atlas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recyclable titanium dioxide (TiO(2))-based photocatalytic self-cleaning films (SCFs) having a bilayer structure were prepared and assessed. These SCFs comprised two layers of fibers fabricated using an electrospinning process. The self-cleaning layer was made of acrylonitrileCbutadieneCstyrene (ABS) fibers with embedded TiO(2) while the substrate layer was composed of fibers made by simultaneously electrospinning poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and ABS. This substrate improved the mechanical strength of the SCF and provided greater adhesion due to the presence of the PVA. The experimental results showed that the hydrophobicity (as assessed by the water contact angle), photocatalytic properties and self-cleaning efficiency of the SCF were all enhanced with increasing TiO(2) content in the ABS/TiO(2) fibers. In addition, the introduction of the substrate layer allowed the SCFs to be applied to various surfaces and then peeled off when desired. The ABS fibers effectively improved the strength of the overall film, while deterioration of the ABS upon exposure to UV light was alleviated by the addition of TiO(2). These SCFs can potentially be recycled after use in various environments, and therefore have applications in the fields of environmental protection and medical science.","output":"Electro-spray deposited TiO(2) bilayer films and their recyclable photocatalytic self-cleaning strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostics have proven to be crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. There are three major methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their role has evolved during the course of the pandemic. Molecular tests such as PCR are highly sensitive and specific at detecting viral RNA, and are recommended by WHO for confirming diagnosis in individuals who are symptomatic and for activating public health measures. Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery. With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges and has caused a catastrophic loss of over 300,000 U.S. lives. This crisis has been compounded by an infodemic, an effusion of misinformation and fake news about COVID-19. This incorrect information has flooded social media and online platforms, confusing and misleading the American public. Yet U.S. constitutional law largely upholds fake news as protected free speech under the First Amendment. This legal reality has significantly compounded the COVID-19 crisis.But U.S. law is not limited to only constitutional enumerated powers. An underexamined approach to regulating fake news is the broad inherent powers of the federal government. Inherent powers are those innate to being a sovereign nation, and they have long been recognized under U.S. law in key areas, including in public health and censorship during times of military conflict. Inherent powers have followed three lines of justification: long-standing international practice, powers naturally pursuant to constitutionally enumerated powers, and emergency powers. Fake news about public health, and COVID-19, in particular, is a strong match for all three of these models under the applicable balancing tests. In addition, traditional First Amendment justifications are particularly weak in the case of COVID-19 misinformation.

Guidelines have been rapidly developed to facilitate optimal triaging, however, they are largely based on expert opinion and observational studies of small retrospective cohorts. This international, multicentre, prospective observational study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 30-day outcomes of patients with kidney, bladder and prostate cancer who underwent elective cancer surgery. Materials & Methods: The COVIDSurg-Cancer Study is a global collaborative observational study that includes urological (prostate, bladder and renal) cancer patients managed between March 2020 and June 2020 who were planned for elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was mortality within 30 days. The secondary outcomes were COVID-19 infections, respiratory complications and post-operative complications within 30 days. Results: Between 11th March and 19th April 2020, prospective data on 436 consecutive patients were collected from centres (Figure 1). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 were significantly more likely to die and experience post-operative respiratory complications including adult respiratory distress syndrome (3/14, 21.4%) (p<0.01), pneumonia (4/14, 28.6%) (p<0.01), oxygen therapy (10/14, 71.4%) (p<0.01) and pulmonary embolism (1/13, 7.1%) (p<0.01) within 30 days. 2/412 (0.5%) COVID-negative patients died within 30 days of operation, compared to 3/14 (21.4%) COVID positive patients, (p<0.01). The rates of 30-day post-operative Clavien-Dindo Grade III+ complications for nephrectomy, cystectomy and prostatectomy were 1.7% (2/119), 7.6% (4/53) and 3.3% (2/61,) respectively. (Figure Presented) Conclusions: This prospective multicentre study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 undergoing elective cancer surgery were more likely to experience respiratory complications and die than patients who did not develop COVID-19. To continue elective cancer surgery throughout future waves of the pandemic, it would be sensible to take precautions to minimise the risk of patients developing COVID-19 peri-operatively.","output":"P0186 Characteristics and 30-day outcomes for urological cancer patients operated on during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and the Wuhan lockdown, Chinese-speaking volunteers from across the world offered a genre ecology to provide accurate technical information and useful resources to inform people;to emphasize the lived experiences of those impacted by the virus;and to coordinate online and offline actions to bring resources and support to those impacted by the pandemic directly and indirectly, using social media platforms Facing barriers of systemic oppression caused by government information control, transnational political tensions, and racial and ethnic discriminations, these civic technical communicators acted as forces of resistance to enact social justice-oriented technical communication In this article, we propose a social justice-oriented, critically contextualized methodology to analyze such transcultural communications and perform a rhetorical genre analysis of example genres We argue that these citizen communicators were transparent about their positionality and aware of their privileges when facilitating crisis communication and disaster relief in order to empower those marginalized in the dominant discourse and oppressed by official relief measures We offer implications on critical practices for researchers, practitioners, and teachers of technical communication for engaging with social justice in transcultural crisis communication ? 2020 ACM","output":"Citizen technical communicators: A Transnational social justice analysis of grassroots genres during the novel coronavirus outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global threat of the coronavirus pandemic has forced policy makers to react quickly with totally new policy\\\\making approaches under conditions of uncertainty.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the seropositivity of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgM/IgG antibodies among children in Beijing, China, evaluate the susceptibility of children in Beijing to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, and provide prima facie evidence to guide SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 prevention and control. METHODS: IgM/IgG antibody kits (colloidal gold) were used to conduct preliminary screening of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgM/IgG antibodies in serum samples of children who presented to Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, having fever or requiring hospitalization, from March 2020 to August 2020. Statistical analysis of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibody seropositivity was performed according to the childrens general demographic characteristics, timing of admission to hospital, presence of pneumonia, and viral nucleic acid test results. RESULTS: The study included 19 797 children with both IgM and IgG antibody results.

We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death. FINDINGS: Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<00001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<00001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 14% [95% CI -77 to 104]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 106 [95% CI 101 to 111] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (157 [105 to 236] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (1830 [196 to 17075]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. INTERPRETATION: Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is common for them to be battery-powered and responsive to a nearby controller, referred to as the base station. They are capable of doing basic computations and transferring information to the base station in most scenarios. They are also in charge of transporting data from distant nodes, putting a burden on nodes with limited resources, and contributing to the quick depletion of energy in these nodes in the process. Nodes in close proximity to the base station are responsible for more than only detecting and sending data to the base station; they are also responsible for transmitting data from faraway nodes. To reward nodes that perform well, a protocol known as the Improved Fuzzy Inspired Energy Effective Protocol (IFIEEP) employs three separate sorts of nodes in order to provide more energy to those who do not. It takes into account the remaining node energy, the node's proximity to the base station, the node's neighbor concentration, and the node's centrality in a cluster when determining node viability. All of these assumptions are founded on a shaky understanding of the situation. Adaptive clustering must be applied to the most viable nodes in order to identify cluster leaders and transmit data to the base station, in addition to disseminating data across the rest of the network, in order to achieve success. In addition, the research provides proper heterogeneity parameters, which describe, among other things, the number of nodes as well as the starting energy of each node. The percentage gain in-network lifetime when compared to current approaches is minor for smaller numbers of supernodes; however, the percentage gain in the area covered 12.89 percent and 100% when more significant numbers of super nodes are used.

More deaths are expected in men and people aged over 70. Pausing screening for longer would result in greater additional CRC cases and deaths. Postponing screening for everyone would be the most cost-effective strategy to minimise the impact of screening disruption without any additional endoscopy capacity. If endoscopy capacity can be increased, temporarily raising the Faecal Immunochemical Test threshold to 190 g/g may help to minimise CRC deaths, particularly if screening programmes start from age 50 in the future.","output":"Modelling the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on bowel cancer screening outcomes in England: A decision analysis to prepare for future screening disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Much remains unknown about the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pregnant women are considered part of the risk population, and vertical transmission of other coronaviruses has been suggested; however, this type of transmission in SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be unlikely. CASE REPORT: A newborn delivered in term via cesarean section to an asymptomatic but COVID-19-positive 35-year-old woman started with respiratory distress in the first 30 min of life. A chest radiograph revealed pneumothorax and ground glass opacities. Ventilatory support with continuous positive airway pressure was needed. Given the respiratory failure and the positive test from the mother, the patient was sampled for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR) at minute 30 of life, with a positive result reported at 36 h of life. No complications had been present during pregnancy, and cardiac screening and blood cultures revealed no other etiologies. CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission was highly likely in this case.

These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease. COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers, especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database, COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer. The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei) to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority of the COVID-QF framework.","output":"A Big Data Based Framework for Executing Complex Query Over COVID-19 Datasets (COVID-QF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is spreading all over the world. With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the epidemiological data on the nutritional practice is scarce. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and nutritional practice in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, ambidirectional cohort study conducted at 11 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. All eligible critical COVID-19 patients in the study hospital intensive care units at 00:00, March 6th, 2020, were included. Data collection was performed via written case report forms. RESULTS A total of 44 patients were identified and enrolled, of whom eight died during the 28-day outcome follow- up period. The median interval between hospital admission and the study day was 24 (interquartile range, 13- 26) days and 52.2% (23 of 44) of patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation. The median nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score was 3 (interquartile range, 2-5) on the study day. During the enrolment day, 68.2% (30 of 44) of patients received enteral nutrition (EN), while 6.8% (3 of 44) received parenteral nutrition (PN) alone. Nausea and aspiration were uncommon, with a prevalence of 11.4% (5 of 44) and 6.8% (3 of 44), respectively. As for energy delivery, 69.7% (23 of 33) of patients receiving EN and/or PN were achieving their prescribed targets. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that EN was frequently applied in critical COVID-19 patients.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the state of physical health and its equivalence according to gender. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (n = 3865), collected during 2020 were used. Structural equation modeling was applied to assess the fit of the model, which included the prediction of measures of alcohol consumption in physical health and the equivalence of measurements of the proposed structural model in men and women. RESULTS: The proposed structural model reported adequate goodness-of-fit indices (SB2/gl = 3.817, CFI = 0.984, TLI = 0.968, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.027 [0.016-0.039]; SRMR = 0.016). Frequent alcohol consumption had a negative effect on physical health (b = ?0.13, P < .01). Similarly, occasional alcohol consumption negatively predicted elevated BMI and chronic conditions such as, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and cancer (b = ?0.09, P < .01). In addition, drinking patterns of alcoholic beverages affect physical health in equal ways for men and women. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight that frequent and occasional alcohol consumption significantly affected physical health in a negative way. Future interventions could address ways to encourage the adoption of a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risks of chronic conditions derived from excessive alcohol consumption.","output":"Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages Associated With Physical Health Status in Adults: Secondary Analysis of the Health Information National Trends Survey Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 diagnosis relies on molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab in the presence of suggestive clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Since bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) collected during fibrobronchoscopy may increase test sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, it was performed during the 2020 pandemic in clinically or radiologically suspected cases. Our aim was to determine whether clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) findings or laboratory tests may predict patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study with multivariable analysis of suspected patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after at least one negative nasopharyngeal swab. Univariable logistic regression for odds ratio and multivariate models was calculated to determine clinical, radiological and laboratory predictors. 32/198 (16%) patients had BAL positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 65/198 tested positive for other pathogens at BAL. Of the 32 patients positive for COVID, 4 had a coinfection at BAL, being thus positive both for COVID as well as for another pathogen while the remaining 105 patients were negative for COVID and other pathogens at BAL. COVID-19 patients had more often highly suggestive CT findings, higher number of involved lobes, more often ground glass opacity of more than 50% of lung parenchyma, and less frequently other radiologically suspected infections. At multivariate model, temperature also predicted BAL positivity. The procedure was well toleratedwith only one desaturation episodewhile no healthcare worker was infected. In conclusion, when nasopharyngeal swabs are negative but there is clinical or imaging suspicion of COVID-19, BAL represents a complementary diagnostic tool, particularly in conjunction with suggestive/more extensive lung involvement at CT scan. The procedure did not carry increased risks for patients nor for operators, while allowing to free hospital resources, avoiding unnecessary isolations.

Novel strategies are needed for equitable access and recruitment of diverse clinical trial populations. OBJECTIVE: To investigate demographic and geographical location data for participants in 2 remote COVID-19 clinical trials with online recruitment and compare with those of a contemporaneous clinic-based COVID-19 study. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted using data from 3 completed, prospective randomized clinical trials conducted at the same time: 2 remotely conducted studies (the Early Treatment Study and Hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 Postexposure Prophylaxis [PEP] Study) and 1 clinic-based study of convalescent plasma (the Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Patients With COVID-19 study). Data were collected from March to August 2020 with 1 to 28 days of participant follow-up. All studies had clinical sites in Seattle, Washington; the 2 remote trials also had collaborating sites in New York, New York; Syracuse, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Los Angeles, California. Two remote trials with inclusive social media strategies enrolled 929 participants with recent SARS-CoV-2 exposure (Hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 PEP Trial) and 231 participants with COVID-19 infection (Early Treatment Study); the clinic-based Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Patients With COVID-19 study enrolled 250 participants with recent COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed from April to August 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Remote trials used inclusive social media strategies and clinician referral for recruitment and telehealth, courier deliveries, and self-collected nasal swabs for remotely conducted study visits. For the clinic-based study, participants were recruited via clinician referral and attended in-person visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Google Analytics data were used to measure online participant engagement and recruitment. Participant demographics and geographical location data from remote trials were pooled and compared with those of the clinic-based study. Statistical comparison of demographic data was limited to participants with COVID infections (ie, those in the remotely conducted Early Treatment Study vs those in the clinic-based study) to improve accuracy of comparison given that the Hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 PEP Trial enrolled participants with COVID-19 exposures and thus had different enrollment criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1410 participants were included. Among 1160 participants in remote trials and 250 participants in the clinic-based trial, the mean (range) age of participants was 39 (18-80) years vs 50 (19-79) years and 676 individuals (58.3%) vs 131 individuals (52.4%) reported female sex. The Early Treatment Study with inclusive social media strategies enrolled 231 participants in 41 US states with increased rates of racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity compared with participants in the clinic-based study. Among 228 participants in the remotely conducted Early Treatment Study with race data vs participants in the clinic-based study, 39 individuals (17.1%) vs 1 individual (0.4%) identified as Alaska Native or American Indian, 11 individuals (4.8%) vs 22 individuals (8.8%) identified as Asian, 26 individuals (11.4%) vs 4 individuals (1.6%) identified as Black, 3 individuals (1.3%) vs 1 individual identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 117 individuals (51.3%) vs 214 individuals (85.6%) identified as White, and 32 individuals (14.0%) vs 8 individuals (3.2%) identified as other race (P < .001). Among 230 individuals in the Early Treatment Study vs 236 individuals in the clinic-based trial with ethnicity data, 71 individuals (30.9%) vs 11 individuals (4.7%) identified as Hispanic or Latinx (P<.001). There were 29 individuals in the Early Treatment Study with nonurban residences (ie, rural, small town, or peri-urban; 12.6%) vs 6 of 248 individuals in the clinic-based trial with residence data (2.4%) (P < .001). In remote trial online recruitment, the highest engagement was with advertisements on social media platforms; among 125 147 unique users with age demographics who clicked on online recruitment advertisements, 84 188 individuals (67.3%) engaged via Facebook.

In this paper, we document that people exhibit EGB when asked to predict the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the future. The bias is positively correlated with optimistic expectations about the future macroeconomic conditions and personal economic circumstances, and investment in a risky asset. We design four interventions to correct EGB and evaluate them through a randomized experiment. In the first treatment (Step), participants make predictions in several short steps;in the second and third treatments (Feedback-N and Feedback-G) participants are given feedback about their prediction errors either in the form of numbers or graphs;and in the fourth treatment (Forecast), participants are offered a forecast range of the future number of cases, based on a statistical model. Our results show that a) Step helps mitigate EGB relative to Baseline, b) Feedback-N, Feedback-G, and Forecast significantly reduce bias relative to both Baseline and Step, c) the interventions decrease risky investment and help moderate future economic expectations through the reduction in EGB.

This technique produces speckles called GB-speckles (Gene Based speckles). All classical strategies of speckle-optics, namely speckle-interferometry, subtraction of speckle-images as well as speckle-correlometry have been inferred for processing of GB-speckles. This indicates the considerable improvement in the present tools of bioinformatics. Methods: Colour s-LASCA imaging of virtual laser GB-speckles, a new method of high discrimination and typing of pathogenic viruses, has been developed. This method has been adapted to the detecting of natural mutations in nucleotide sequences, related to the spike glycoprotein (coding the gene ?S?) of SARSCCoV-2 gene as the molecular target. Results: The rate of the colouring images of virtual laser GB-speckles generated by s-LASCA can be described by the specific value of R. If the nucleotide sequences compared utilizing this approach the relevant images are completely identical, then the three components of the resulting colour image will be identical, and therefore the value of R will be equal to zero. However, if there are at least minimal differences in the matched nucleotide sequences, then the value of R will be positive.

MethodsIn a convenience sample of 25 Massachusetts public K-12 school districts, de-identified information about SARS-CoV-2 cases and their school-based contacts was reported using a standardized contact-tracing tool. Index cases were included if they were in school while infectious. SAR was defined as the proportion of in-school contacts acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection and designated as possible or probable in-school transmission by school-based teams. We compared exposure-specific SAR using unadjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); p-values were calculated using Fishers exact tests. ResultsEight districts (70 schools with >33,000 enrolled students) participated. There were 435 index cases and 1,771 school-based contacts (Table 1). Most contacts (1327/1771 [75%]) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 39/1327 (2.9%) contacts tested positive. Of 39 positive contacts, 10 (25.6%) had clear out-of-school exposures and were deemed not in-school transmissions, so were excluded from further calculations.

Here we demonstrate that sensitization with bacterial peptides can induce heterologous immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) derived peptides and that vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can induce heterologous immunity to bacterial peptides. Using in silico prediction methods, we identified 6 bacterial peptides with sequence homology to either the spike protein or non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) of SARS-CoV-2. Notwithstanding the effects of bystander activation, in vitro co-cultures showed that all individuals tested (n=18) developed heterologous immunity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides when sensitized with the identified bacterial peptides. T cell recall responses measured included cytokine production (IFN-, TNF, IL-2), activation (CD69) and proliferation (CellTrace). As an extension of the principle of heterologous immunity between bacterial pathogens and COVID-19, we tracked donor responses before and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and measured the cross-reactive T cell responses to bacterial peptides with similar sequence homology to the spike protein. We found that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could induce heterologous immunity to bacterial peptides. These findings provide a mechanism for heterologous T cell immunity between common bacterial pathogens and SARS-CoV-2, which may explain the high variance in COVID-19 outcomes from asymptomatic to severe.

However, the waning of the humoral immune response, which does not seem to last so many months after the completion of the vaccination program, has led us to study the molecular immunological mechanisms of waning immunity in the case of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We consulted the published scientific literature and from the few articles we found, we were convinced that there is an immunological memory problem after vaccination. Although mRNA vaccines have been demonstrated to induce antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) in the human population, there is no evidence that these vaccines induce the production of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), in a SARS-CoV-2 virus na?ve population. This obstacle, in our point of view, is caused by the presence, in almost all subjects, of a cellular T and B cross-reactive memory produced during past exposures to the common cold coronaviruses. Due to this interference, it is difficult for a vaccination with the Spike protein alone, without adjuvants capable of prolonging the late phase of the generation of the immunological memory, to be able to determine the production of protective LLPCs. This would explain the possibility of previously and completely vaccinated subjects to become infected, already 4C6 months after the completion of the vaccination cycle.","output":"mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines and Long-Lived Plasma Cells: A Complicated Relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is potentially the greatest global public health crisis of this century This disease emerged as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province in China, in December 2019 Otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons and dentists are at an increased risk of occupational disease Objective The present review summarizes currently published evidence of Covid-19 epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention No proven effective treatments for this disease currently exist Data Synthesis COVID-19 started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, and it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring Symptoms are varied, and not all patients develop all of them Conclusion Social distancing seems to have been successful in several places in the world However, this recommendation alone is not enough to contain the disease, and it is not a long-term solution Large-scale testing by health professionals of representative samples of the population may give an estimate of the progression of the disease Different treatments are under test and bring hope of a cure to the population However, no current treatments (April 27, 2020) have been proven to be the key to success in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 Planetary health is a useful concept to understand the current drivers of this pandemic and to draw a roadmap for science and healthcare that may guide actions to fight economic depression and ensure a healthy recovery","output":"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Planetary Health.

To relieve fears regarding contracting COVID-19 infection through public transportation, the government should provide accurate information and take appropriate measures to lower the risk of COVID-19. This study aimed to develop a model for determining the risk of COVID-19 infection on public transportation considering exposure time, mask efficiency, ventilation rate, and distance. The risk of COVID-19 infection on public transportation was estimated, and the effectiveness of measures to reduce the risk was assessed. The correlation between the risk of infection and various factors was identified through sensitivity analysis of major factors.

In this work, we report that in a subset of patientsdespite a decline in total S-specific antibodiesneutralizing antibody titers remain at a similar level for an average of 98 days in longitudinal sampling of a cohort of 59 Hispanic/Latino patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that 100% of seroconverting patients make detectable neutralizing antibody responses which can be quantified by a surrogate viral neutralization test. Examination of sera from ten out of the 59 subjects which received mRNA-based vaccination revealed that both IgG titers and neutralizing activity of sera were higher after vaccination compared to a cohort of 21 SARS-CoV-2 na?ve subjects. One dose was sufficient for the induction of a neutralizing antibody, but two doses were necessary to reach 100% surrogate virus neutralization in subjects irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status. Like the pattern observed after natural infection, the total anti-S antibodies titers declined after the second vaccine dose; however, neutralizing activity remained relatively constant for more than 80 days after the first vaccine dose. Furthermore, our data indicates thatcompared with mRNA vaccinationnatural infection induces a more robust humoral immune response in unexposed subjects. This work is an important contribution to understanding the natural immune response to the novel coronavirus in a population severely impacted by SARS-CoV-2.

Gut dysbiosis leads to imbalance in circulating contents of microbiota-derived metabolites and disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), contributing to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The composition of gut microbiota may be influenced by various antibiotics. However, how perioperative use of antibiotics affects POCD needs more explorations. In the present study, we explored the effect of cefazolin, a common antibiotic used in perioperative period, on cognitive function, BBB integrity, gut bacteria and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a group of widely studied metabolites in aged mice, using 18-month-old male mice. Significant BBB disruptions and decreased levels of tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and Occludin (OCLN) were seen in the mice of POCD model. Cefazolin treatment attenuated these changes induced by anesthesia and surgery. Furthermore, cefazolin reversed the changes in several fecal bacteria (?-, ?3/?-, ?-Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) as determined by qPCR tests. Analysis of plasma SCFAs showed that almost all types of SCFAs were reduced in POCD and cefazolin administration reversed the changes in expression of the two most abundant SCFAs (acetic and propionic acids). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that cefazolin improved POCD.

Aim The main objectives of the study were to determine the impact of confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on the psychological distress of Moroccan adolescents and identify the risk and protective factors that could influence their mental health. Methods The participants in this study were Moroccan high school students who were recruited at two different timesbefore the COVID-19 pandemic (350 students, mean age: 16.55 years;53.71% female;data collected in 2014/2015) and after the announcement of the pandemic (457 students, mean age: 16.84;64.1% female;data collected in 2020). Students responded to an anonymous survey that included several validated instruments, such as the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionary, and elicited information about the students' psychosocial environment, gender, and age. The scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory dimensions from the pre-pandemic period and during 2020 were compared. A comparison between the scores of the two genders of the 2020 sample was also carried out. In addition, binary regression analysis was performed to predict the associations between gender, frequency of physical activity, the presence of the number of negative psychosocial factors, and those dimensions of the Brief Symptom Inventory that significantly changed between the samples. Results Female students reported higher psychological distress than male students in both data collection periods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students scored significantly (p < 0.001) higher in depression and paranoid ideation, and they scored significantly (p = 0.01) lower in hostility and anxiety compared with the pre-pandemic period.

While it is still uncertain how COVID-19 will reshape our society, the global pandemic is encouraging and accelerating innovation and advancement, especially in the digital sphere. This chapter focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education service, which is typically classified as a service industry in industrial classifications. Digital transformation in the education sector has attracted significant attention recently. The current education system in Japan is based on a structure that was institutionalized in the industrial age. Although education has seen innovation since then, it is one of the sectors wherein innovation occurs at a slow pace, and therefore, it does not meet the sectors expectations and demands. The COVID-19 pandemic is, however, accelerating digital transformation in education: Not only in Japan, but globally too, educators, students, policymakers, and other role players are now actively undertaking efforts to bring about digital transformation in this sector. This chapter reviews the rapid expansion of digital transformation in the education service and explores, in detail, the two main trends in digital transformation in the education service in Japan. These trends are the expanding of distance education and increasing innovation in educational technologies. The discussion further reflects on prior studies questioning the impact of digital transformation on education; it also anticipates and explores the effects of and concerns about the digital transformation in the education service. Finally, the chapter includes a discussion on how to address these concerns and maximize the digital impact. It indicates three concerns of the digital transformation in the education service: (1) poor motivation management, (2) negative effect of IT devices usage in education, (3) educational inequality by digital divide. They can be overcome by changing roles of instructors and further investment in ICT infrastructure in the education service. The discussions in this chapter give insight into how the education service might evolve after the COVID-19 pandemic. The distance education is becoming a new normal in the education service. However, the education community in general is not ready to maximize the merits of distance learning. We need to change the role of instructors from a knowledge teacher to a learning motivator and progress manager. In addition, we need more investment in ICT infrastructure in the education service to enhance educational effects.","output":"How the COVID-19 Pandemic Is Reshaping the Education Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Emotion-motivation models propose that behaviors, including compliance with safety behaviors, should be predicted by the same variables that also predict negative affect since emotional reactions should induce a motivation to avoid threatening situations. In contrast, social cognitive models propose that safety behaviors are predicted by a different set of variables that mainly reflect cognitive and socio-structural aspects. Methods: Here, we directly tested these opposing hypotheses in young adults (N = 4,134) in the context of COVID-19-related safety behaviors to prevent infections. In each participant, we collected measures of negative affect as well as cognitive and socio-structural variables during the lockdown in the first infection wave in Germany. Results: We found a negative effect of the pandemic on emotional responses. However, this was not the main predictor for young adults willingness to comply with COVID-19- related safety measures. Instead, individual differences in compliance were mainly predicted by cognitive and socio-structural variables. These results were confirmed in an independent data set. Conclusions: This study shows that individuals scoring high on negative affect during the pandemic are not necessarily more likely to comply with safety regulations. Instead, political measures should focus on cognitive interventions and the societal relevance of the health issue.

However the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined, and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong districts of Southern China, where we have identified a number of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk. A total of 1,596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017. Nine participants (0.6%) tested positive for bat coronaviruses. 265 (17%) participants reported severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and/or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past year, which were associated with poultry, carnivore, rodent/shrew, or bat contact, with variability by family income and district of residence. This study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in Southern China. The low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event.

It included the following types of daily employment: sleep, educational activities, housework, time at the computer for non-educational purposes, lying in a horizontal position, maintaining physical fitness, watching TV, other employment-its own version, which could include work, volunteer activities, etc. The students participating in the study were given instructions as subjects: Please remember what exactly you were usu-ally busy with during the day during the period of self-isolation and express it in % ratio, based on the total amount of 100%. In the line: Other employment C list what exactly you were doing. Mathematical and statistical data processing is carried out on the basis of the MS package Office Excel, IBM SPSS Statistics 23. The reliability of the differences in the indicators of the two student groups was determined by the Mann-Whitney U-criterion. Results. It is established that ill virus COVID-19 students differ from students without a history of them, the higher the overall level of meaningfulness of life;although the structure of the General level of meaningfulness of life in them is the same (in first place is the goal of life, followed by: locus of control life, the process of life, the result of life;this completes the hierarchy of locus of control, I), but the students had been ill with the virus COVID-19, live with a more pronounced sense of the efficiency of life and are more motivated people;they also have a relatively higher indicators of locus of control life, the process of life, locus of control I;ill with the virus COVID-19 students have similar levels of belief in the benevolence of the world and control the events in their life events without a history of them stu-dents. At the same time in their cognitive models of the world was formed more than a high, but not beyond the normative values, the level of basic beliefs C in their own luck and luck, the value and significance of their own I, there is justice;students who recover from the virus COVID-19, more varied structure of his employment during the day, compared to without a history of them students. Conclusion. The data obtained empirically confirm the presence of differences between the student samples: students who have had the COVID-19 virus infection differ from their peers who have not had it, both by the peculiarities of the semantic sphere of the individual and by the peculiarities of structuring the time of their own life. In order to scientifically explain these identified differences, additional research is required with a large coverage of students. ? 2021, Science and Innovation Center Publishing House.

The most comprehensive manifestation of a scientific model, including crucial assumptions and parameters that underpin its usability, is usually embedded in associated source code and documentation, which may employ a variety of (potentially outdated) programming practices and languages. Domain experts cannot gain a complete understanding of the implementation of a scientific model if they are not familiar with the code. Furthermore, rapid research and development iterations make it challenging to keep up with constantly evolving scientific model codebases. To address these challenges, we develop a system for the automated creation and human-assisted curation of a knowledge graph of computable scientific models that analyzes a model's code in the context of any associated inline comments and external documentation. Our system uses knowledge-driven as well as data-driven approaches to identify and extract relevant concepts from code and equations from textual documents to semantically annotate models using domain terminology. These models are converted into executable Python functions and then can further be composed into complex workflows to answer different forms of domain-driven questions.

We aimed to study whether using ACEIs or ARBs had protective effects for community acquired pneumonia. METHODS This database cohort study was conducted retrospectively in Taiwan. The hypertensive patients were the target population of this study. Patients with ARB use were defined as our first study cohort. The second study cohort comprised patients who used ACEI. Propensity-score matching at 1:1 was used between ARB users and non-ARB users. We recruited 67 944 participants for the ARB study and 58 062 participants for the ACEI study. The same matching was also performed between ACEI users and non-ACEI users. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to analyze the risk of the outcome of viral pneumonia. RESULTS The hazard ratio of community acquired pneumonia for ARB users relative to non-ARB users was 0.33. The hazard ratio of community acquired pneumonia was 0.71 times in ACEI users compared with ACEI nonusers. In stratification analysis, both ARB and ACEI both exhibited a protective effect for community acquired pneumonia in each age and sex group. In the analysis of the effects of therapy duration, patients using ARB for fewer than 100 days exhibited a greater reduction in the risk of community acquired pneumonia (adjusted HR = 0.58) compared with the non-ARB cohort. For the ACEI study, patients who used ACEI for 121 to 450 days were more likely to exhibit reduced risks of community acquired pneumonia (adjusted HR = 0.5).

As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. RESULTS By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.","output":"Detecting and Filtering Immune-Related Adverse Events Signal Based on Text Mining and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Common Data Model: Framework Development Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of us have watched scientists, health professionals and policy makers debate, and struggle on how to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.

It is practically impossible to implement this task manually due to the high volume of the relevant literature. Text mining has been considered to be a powerful approach to address this challenge, especially the topic modeling, a well-known unsupervised method that aims to reveal latent topics from the literature. However, in spite of its potential utility, the results generated from this approach are often investigated manually. Hence, its application to the COVID-19 literature is not straightforward and expert knowledge is needed to make meaningful interpretations. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical framework for estimating topic interactions and effective visualization for topic interpretation. Here we assumed that topics constituting a paper can be positioned on an interaction map, which belongs to a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Based on this assumption, after summarizing topics with their topic-word distributions using the biterm topic model, we mapped these latent topics on networks to visualize relationships among the topics. Moreover, in the proposed approach, we developed a score that is helpful to select meaningful words that characterize the topic. We interpret the relationships among topics by tracking the change of relationships among topics using a trajectory plot generated with different levels of word richness. These results together provide deeply mined and intuitive representation of relationships among topics related to a specific research area. The application of this proposed framework to the PubMed literature shows that our approach facilitates understanding of the topics constituting the COVID-19 knowledge.","output":"Network-based Trajectory Analysis of Topic Interaction Map for Text Mining of COVID-19 Biomedical Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stay-at-home orders have proven a controversial, while effective, method of SARS-CoV-2 containment. However objective measures of how the pandemic and stay-at-home orders are affecting the daily health of uninfected individuals have been lacking. METHODS We investigated the effect of pandemic-related events on 61 individuals in San Antonio, Texas whose daily activity and sleep data were recorded via wearable activity trackers from April 2019 to August 2020. We assessed changes in six fitness metrics (steps walked, resting heart rate, sedentary minutes, wake duration after sleep onset, rapid eye movement (REM) duration, total sleep duration). Cluster analysis and time-course analysis identified trends in activity before, after and during stay-at-home orders. Quantitative measures of activities were compared to survey responses. RESULTS Four behavior patterns during stay-at-home orders were identified. Most individuals suffered declines in healthy habits compared to their daily activity in 2019 and early 2020 (e.g., up to -60% steps walked). Inflection points corresponded with key dates relevant to SARS-CoV-2 including the first reported case in the U.S. (Feb 29) and city-wide stay-at-home orders (Mar 23). Pre-existing conditions (diabetes, asthma) were associated with a steeper than average decline in sleep quality during stay-at-home orders. Unexpectedly, we also identified a group of predominately male individuals who improved their daily fitness during stay-at-home orders.

PURPOSE: Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS) certification is endorsed to distinguish pharmacists for advanced practice areas, yet perceived value to stakeholders remains poorly described. This study characterized how board certification is integrated in hospital pharmacy departments across California. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in which a survey was administered to all hospital pharmacy directors in California between November 2019 and March 2020. Licensed institutions and corresponding pharmacy directors were identified from the California State Board of Pharmacy. The survey queried for institution and pharmacy director characteristics and if/how board certification was integrated. Multivariable logistic models identified predictors of institutions with at least 25% full-time board-certified pharmacists and those that reward board certification. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 29% of institutions. Most of these institutions were urban (81%) and nonteaching (57%), with fewer than 325 hospital beds (71%), and with fewer than 50 full-time pharmacist positions (86%). The majority reported that less than 25% of their pharmacists were board certified. Currently, 47% consider board certification during hiring and 38% reward board-certified employees. Predictors of institutions with 25% or more board-certified pharmacists included being a teaching institution (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-7.06), having 325 or more beds (OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 2.86-17.97), and having a pharmacy director who was previously or currently board certified (OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.46-9.35). Hospitals with 100 or more pharmacist positions predicted institutions that reward board certification (OR, 16.69; 95% CI, 1.78-156.86). CONCLUSION: Board certification was an employment preference for almost half of the hospital survey respondents in California.

Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide.

SETTING: The survey was embedded in the Stanford Wellness Living Laboratory-China (WELL China) study, an ongoing prospective community-based cohort study during 2018C2019. PARTICIPANTS: The survey was conducted by telephone interview among 4144 adult urban residents participating in the WELL China study at baseline. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, depressive symptoms and GP contact during the lockdown period (February to March 2020). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Depressive symptoms were measured using the WHO-Five Well-being Index, comprising five questionnaire items that briefly indicate psychological well-being. Logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between GP contact and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 3356 participants responded to the survey; 203 were excluded owing to missing data on depressive symptoms, leaving 3153 participants in the present study. During lockdown, 449 participants had GP contact. GP contact was significantly negatively associated with prevalent depressive symptoms (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89; p<0.01) and incident depressive symptoms (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93; p<0.05).

Laparoscopic TEP repair would be much easier to perform in such cases by transecting the hernia sac. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of transection of the hernia sac during laparoscopic TEP. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five hundred twenty laparoscopic TEP repairs were performed on 498 patients by a single surgeon from July 2003 to December 2008. The patients were classified into two groups: the transected sac (TS) group with 269 patients (275 cases) and the completely reduced sac (RS) group with 230 patients (245 cases). RESULTS Statistical analysis between the TS and RS groups showed no significant differences in postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and recurrence, except for postoperative seromas, which were more frequent in the TS group (24 of 275) than the RS group (6 of 245; P = .002). And the mean operative time was longer in the TS group (23.62  10.25 minutes) than the RS group (21.49  8.17 minutes; P = .010).

Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed us to detect the presence of spike protein with significantly low LoD ~4.2 fmol.","output":"Femtomolar-level detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using toroidal plasmonic metasensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has important effects on the onset and development of puberty. Although a number of studies have confirmed the relationship between obesity and precocious puberty, little is known about the pleiotropic genes of obesity and precocious puberty and the interaction between genes and environment. There are four objectives: (1) to analyze the incidence of precocious puberty in the general population in China; (2) to verify the direct effect of obesity on childrens precocious puberty using a variety of methods; (3) to verify the effect of obesity and its risk gene polymorphism on precocious puberty in a prospective cohort study; and (4) to analyze the interaction effect of genes and environment on pubertal development. METHODS: We will conduct a multi-center prospective cohort study in three cities, which are selected in southern, central, and northern China, respectively. Primary schools in these cities will be selected by a stratified cluster random sampling method. Primary school students from grade 1 to grade 3 (6 to 10 years old) will be selected for the cohort with extensive baseline data collection, including assessment of pubertal development, family demographic information, early development, sleep pattern, dietary pattern, and physical activity. Participants will be followed up for at least three years, and long-term follow-up will depend on future funding. DISCUSSION: The findings of this multicenter prospective population-based cohort study may expand previous related puberty development research as well as provide important information on the mechanism of early puberty. Targeted interventions can also be developed to improve adolescent health problems related to puberty development based on the available evidence.

Relatively little is known, however, about the organisation's evolving relationship with health-related personal beliefs, 'faith-based organisations' (FBOs), religious leaders and religious communities ('religious actors'). This article presents findings from a 4-year research project on the 'spiritual dimension' of health and WHO conducted at the University of Zrich. Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","output":"Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia del Covid-19 marc un hito en la historia del turismo debido a que los procesos de globalizacin y compresin espacio-temporal que se haban registrado en los ltimos 75 a?os, fueron suspendidos.

Further, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is utilized to prioritize the SCRs considering the epidemic situations to understand the criticality of SCRs and determine appropriate RMSs to mitigate the shock of SCRs during COVID-19. Findings: This study prioritized and ranked the SCRs within the Indian apparel industry based on their severity during the COVID-19 disruption. Results indicate that the demand uncertainty and pandemic disruption risks are the most critical. Based on the SCRs, the present work evaluated and suggested the flexibility and postponement mitigation strategies for the case under study. Research limitations/implications: This study has novel implications to the existing literature on supply chain risk management in the form of the FAHP framework. Supply chain practitioners from the other industrial sectors can extend the proposed FAHP framework to assess the SCRs and identify suitable mitigation strategies. The results aid the practitioners working in an apparel industry to benchmark and deploy the proposed RMSs in their firm.

The mission of symbolic learning is to provide algorithms and methodologies to extract logical information from data and express it in an interpretable way. In the context of temporal data, interval temporal logic has been recently proposed as a suitable tool for symbolic learning, specifically via the design of an interval temporal logic decision tree extraction algorithm. Building on it, we study here its natural generalization to interval temporal random forests, mimicking the corresponding schema at the propositional level. Interval temporal random forests turn out to be a very performing multivariate time series classification method, which, despite the introduction of a functional component, are still logically interpretable to some extent. We apply this method to the problem of diagnosing COVID-19 based on the time series that emerge from cough and breath recording of positive versus negative subjects. Our experiment show that our models achieve very high accuracies and sensitivities, often superior to those achieved by classical methods on the same data. Although other recent approaches to the same problem (based on different and more numerous data) show even better statistical results, our solution is the first logic-based, interpretable, and explainable one. ?

Methods: : A logistic-negative binomial (Logit-NB) hurdle model is employed to examine the determinants on the probability of death and the value of CFR with COVID-19, based on confirmed cases and deaths by 13 March 2020 and 25 January 2021 at the city level in China and related environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic data. Results: : We found that the probability of death from COVID-19 will increase by 1% with 1 newly increased confirmed case and increase by 4% in response to a rise of 1 unit in the air quality index. CFR will feebly increase with the number of confirmed cases, with the estimator being 2.81E-05. As the number of doctors increases by 10,000, CFR will decrease by 0.18%. Each 1% increase in the humidity leads to a 0.02% decrease in CFR, and each 1-unit increase in the population density causes a 0.09% decline in CFR. The comparison between the two research periods confirms the robustness of the results. Conclusions: : The number of confirmed cases and the air quality are closely associated with the death probability, while the number of confirmed cases, the medical resources, the humidity, and the population density significantly affect the CFR. Furthermore, the air quality and population density stand out in the first wave of epidemic outbreak, while they become non-significant in the second wave.","output":"Determinants on COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates of Cities in China: A Logit-NB Hurdle Model Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitals have established visiting restrictions to block coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) external transmission routes. This study investigated factors associated with nurses internal transfer intentions and changes in their workloads, burdens, and daily lives owing to pandemic-related family visiting restrictions.

Both practitioners and ethnographers have to be in specific spaces at particular times. This practical challenge illustrates that there are focal times and spaces, which are linked to the cyclical and sited character of global health governance. These focal times and spaces provide an important coordination mechanism and ease the general flow of knowledge C within IOs and between IOs and their environment. However, there is also the constant danger that they develop a self\\\\referential life of their own and become disconnected from other processes.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis was carried out at a granular spatial resolution of census tracts to explore the spatial patterns and contextual SDOH associated with COVID-19 incidence from a Hispanic population mostly consisting of a Mexican American population living in Cameron County, Texas on the border of the United States and Mexico. We performed age-stratified analysis to identify different contributing SDOH and quantify their effects by age groups. METHODS: We included all reported COVID-19Cpositive cases confirmed by reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction testing between March 18 (first case reported) and December 16, 2020, in Cameron County, Texas. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were aggregated to weekly counts by census tracts. We adopted a Bayesian spatiotemporal negative binomial model to investigate the COVID-19 incidence rate in relation to census tract demographics and SDOH obtained from the American Community Survey. Moreover, we investigated the impact of local mitigation policy on COVID-19 by creating the binary variable shelter-in-place. The analysis was performed on all COVID-19Cconfirmed cases and age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the relative incidence risk (RR) of COVID-19 was higher among census tracts with a higher percentage of single-parent households (RR=1.016, 95% posterior credible intervals [CIs] 1.005, 1.027) and a higher percentage of the population with limited English proficiency (RR=1.015, 95% CI 1.003, 1.028). Lower RR was associated with lower income (RR=0.972, 95% CI 0.953, 0.993) and the percentage of the population younger than 18 years (RR=0.976, 95% CI 0.959, 0.993). The most significant association was related to the shelter-in-place variable, where the incidence risk of COVID-19 was reduced by over 50%, comparing the time periods when the policy was present versus absent (RR=0.506, 95% CI 0.454, 0.563). Moreover, age-stratified analyses identified different significant contributing factors and a varying magnitude of the shelter-in-place effect. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, SDOH including social environment and local emergency measures were identified in relation to COVID-19 incidence risk at the census tract level in a highly disadvantaged population with limited health care access and a high prevalence of chronic conditions. Results from our analysis provide key knowledge to design efficient testing strategies and assist local public health departments in COVID-19 control, mitigation, and implementation of vaccine strategies.","output":"Census Tract Patterns and Contextual Social Determinants of Health Associated With COVID-19 in a Hispanic Population From South Texas: A Spatiotemporal Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical significance of respiratory viruses (RVs) as an etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis is usually underestimated.

CP has been in use for at least a century to provide passive immunity against a number of diseases, and was recently proposed by the World Health Organization for human Ebola virus infection. Only a few small studies have so far been published on patients with COVID-19 and concomitant hematological malignancies (HM). The Italian Hematology Alliance on HM and COVID-19 has found that HM patients with COVID-19 clinically perform more poorly than those with either HM or COVID-19 alone. A COVID-19 infection in patients with B-cell lymphoma is associated with impaired generation of neutralizing antibody titers and lowered clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Treatment with CP was seen to increase antibody titers in all patients and to improve clinical response in 80% of patients examined. However, a recent study has reported impaired production of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in an immunosuppressed individual treated with CP, possibly supporting the notion of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. This may limit the efficacy of CP treatment in at least some HM patients. More recently, it has been shown that CP may provide a neutralising effect against B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants, thus expanding its application in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales-the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7-for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation.

Preoperative assessments can be conducted on the internet to improve efficiency and reduce wait times for operations. MyPreOp is a cloud-based platform where patients can complete preoperative questionnaires. These are reviewed by a nurse who determines whether they need a subsequent face-to-face appointment. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to describe the potential impact of MyPreOp (Ultramed Ltd) on the number of face-to-face appointments. The secondary objectives are to examine the time spent on preoperative assessments completed using MyPreOp in NHS Trusts and user ratings of usability and acceptability. METHODS The study design was a case study service evaluation. Data were collected using the MyPreOp system from 2 NHS Trusts (Guy's and St Thomas' and Royal United Hospitals Bath) and the private BMI Bath Clinic during the 4-month period from September to December 2020. Participants were adults of any age and health status at the participating hospitals who used MyPreOp to complete a preoperative assessment before a scheduled surgery. The primary outcome was the number of face-to-face appointments avoided by patients who used MyPreOp. The investigated secondary outcomes included the length of time spent by nurses completing preoperative assessments, associated travel-related carbon dioxide emissions compared with standard care, and quantitative user feedback. User feedback was assessed at all 3 sites; however, the other outcomes could only be examined in the Royal United Hospitals Bath sample because of data limitations. RESULTS Data from 2500 participants were included. Half of the assessed patients did not need a further face-to-face appointment and required a median of only 5.3 minutes of nurses' time to review. The reduction in appointments was associated with a small saving of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (9.05 tons). Patient feedback was generally positive: 79.8% (317/397) of respondents rated MyPreOp as easy or very easy to use, and 85.2% (340/399) thought the overall experience was good or very good. CONCLUSIONS This evaluation demonstrates the potential benefits of MyPreOp. However, further research using rigorous scientific methodology and a larger sample of NHS Trusts and users is needed to provide strong evidence of MyPreOp's efficacy, usability, and cost-effectiveness.","output":"The Potential Impacts of a Digital Preoperative Assessment Service on Appointments, Travel-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and User Experience: Case Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review examines research on environmental impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a systems-oriented sustainability perspective, focusing on three areas: air quality and human health, climate change, and production and consumption.

We performed a joint study of gene expression and DNA methylation of brain tissue originating from the human prefrontal cortex of individuals across the lifespan to describe changes in cellular programs and their regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. The analysis considers previous knowledge in terms of functional gene signatures and chromatin states derived from independent studies, aging profiles of a battery of chromatin modifying enzymes, and data of gliomas and neuropsychological disorders for a holistic view on the development and aging of the brain. Expression and methylation changes from babies to elderly adults decompose into different modes associated with the serial activation of (brain) developmental, learning, metabolic and inflammatory functions, where methylation in gene promoters mostly represses transcription. Expression of genes encoding methylome modifying enzymes is very diverse reflecting complex regulations during lifetime which also associates with the marked remodeling of chromatin between permissive and restrictive states. Data of brain cancer and psychotic disorders reveal footprints of pathophysiologies related to brain development and aging. Comparison of aging brains with gliomas supports the view that glioblastoma-like and astrocytoma-like tumors exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while oligodendrogliomas have a more stable differentiation hierarchy more resembling the aged brain. The balance and specific shifts between volatile and stable and between more irreversible and more plastic epigenomic networks govern the development and aging of healthy and diseased brain.","output":"The Transcriptome and Methylome of the Developing and Aging Brain and Their Relations to Gliomas and Psychological Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a new disease associated with a recent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Several studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries before and during enforced isolation (ie, lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced in England, and compare the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we analysed data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study weighted to population proportions, which collects information on anxiety (using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment) and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire) weekly in the UK since March 21, 2020. We included data from adults living in England who had at least three repeated measures between March 23 and Aug 9, 2020. Analyses were done using latent growth models, which were fitted to account for sociodemographic and health covariates. FINDINGS: Between March 23, and Aug 9, data from over 70 000 adults were collected in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. When including participants living in England with three follow-up measures and no missing values, our analytic sample consisted of 36 520 participants. The average depression score was 66 (SD=60, range 0C27) and the average anxiety score 57 (SD=56, range 0C21) in week 1. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=C193, SE=026, p<00001 for anxiety; b=C252, SE=028, p<00001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

METHODS: The CRO-VAX HCP study is a multicentre, prospective, interventional study conducted in several sites in Belgium. The study included 231 health-care professional volunteers who received the two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 73 were previously infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 158 were uninfected and seronegative. In the first group, blood samples were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 days. In the second group, samples were obtained at baseline and after 14 and 28 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time-points. RESULTS: In uninfected individuals, 95.5% (95% CI 91.0%-98.2%) developed anti-spike antibodies after 14 days and a 24.9-fold rise (95% CI 21.4%-28.9%) in antibody titre was observed after the second dose.

In the exploratory genomic analysis, mRNA expression of location-dependent genes is highly influenced by ERG status and African American race. However, tumor location did not impact the expression of AR or the major canonical AR-target genes (KLK3, AMACR, and MYC). CONCLUSIONS: ERGnegative tumor status is the strongest predictor of anterior prostate tumors, regardless of race. Furthermore, AR expression and canonical AR signaling do not impact tumor location.","output":"TMPRSS2-ERG fusion impacts anterior tumor location in men with prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Homeless shelters are identified as places where humans are at high risk of acquiring respiratory disease. We previously reported the prevalence of the main respiratory diseases affecting a population of homeless in Marseille, France. Here, we investigated the prevalence of 10 respiratory viruses in a similar homeless population during 2 successive winter seasons. FINDINGS: Following a clinical examination, we collected nasal specimens from which the RT-PCR detection of 10 respiratory viruses was performed through snapshot investigations. Among the 265 patients included, 150 (56.6%) reported at least one respiratory symptom of which 13 (8.7%) had positive swabs for at least one respiratory virus, and 115 patients reported any respiratory symptom of which 10 (8.7%) had positive swabs for respiratory virus. Overall, 23 patients had positive swabs for at least one respiratory virus. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the predominant virus (13 isolates) followed by enteroviruses (3), human metapneumovirus (2), human coronavirus OC43 (2), 229E virus (2) and human respiratory syncytial virus subtype B (1). Among the patients infected with HRV, 10 were collected during the same snapshot. CONCLUSIONS: Although one half of the patients reported respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of respiratory viruses was within the range of that previously described in adult asymptomatic patients outside the homeless community. Most HRV-positive swabs were collected during the same snapshot suggesting a local outbreak. No influenza viruses were found despite the fact that one half of the patients were investigated during the peak of the seasonal influenza epidemic in Marseille.","output":"Respiratory viruses within homeless shelters in Marseille, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, the challenges faced by woven kenaf thermoset polymer composites in Malaysia were addressed with respect to three major aspects: woven kenaf reinforcement quality, Malaysian citizen awareness of woven kenaf thermoset composite products, and government supports.

Hydrogen peroxide is produced physiologically by oral bacteria and plays a significant role in the balance of oral microecology since it is an important antimicrobial agent.

The induced oxidative stress stimulates a local innate response via activation of the toll-like receptors and the NF-&#954;B. Those kinds of reactions are also activated by viral infections. Virus-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in the regulation of the host immune system and the specific oxidant-sensitive pathway is one of the effective strategies against viral infections. Therefore, nose/mouth/throat washing with hydrogen peroxide may enhance those local innate responses to viral infections and help protect against the current coronavirus pandemic.

Methods The RTI case definitions were developed using demographic, diagnostic coding and keywords in electronic medical record. Manual chart abstraction was performed to identify cases of acute otitis media. Remaining RTI definitions were validated using a random sample of 5,164 patients with encounters in 2019. The proportion of patients with an RTI treated with antibiotics was determined by provider, per patient, per episode and per patient encounter. Results Negative predictive value, positive predictive value and prevalence were as follows: 1.00 (0.99-1.00), 0.99 (0.96-0.99) and 4.14% (4.10-4.19) for common cold; 1.00 (0.99-1.00), 0.94 (0.88-0.98) and 1.09% (1.07-1.12) for acute otitis media; 0.98 (0.96-1.00), 0.93 (0.87-0.97) and 1.2% (1.18-1.22) for acute pharyngitis; 0.99 (0.99-1.00), 0.88 (0.81-0.93) and 1.99% (1.96-2.02) for sinusitis; 0.99 (0.97-0.99), 0.95 (0.89-0.98) and 4.01% (3.97-4.05) for acute bronchitis/asthma. By provider, median (interquartile range [IQR]) proportion treated with antibiotics (per patient) was 6.72 (14.92) for common cold, 64.29 (40.00) for acute otitis media, 20.00 (38.89) for pharyngitis, 54.17 (38.09) for sinusitis, 8.33 (20.00) for acute bronchitis/asthma and 21.10 (20.56) for overall RTI.

Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 among military personnel serve as biomarkers of infection and provide a basis for disease surveillance and recognition of work-related risk factors. METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG in serum obtained from N = 988 US National Guard soldiers between April-June 2020. Occupational information, e.g. military operating specialty (MOS) codes, and demographic data were obtained via questionnaire. Plaque assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were used to assess serum neutralizing capacity for limited subjects (N = 12). RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rate among the study population was 10.3% and significantly associated with occupation and demographics. Odds ratios were highest for those working in MOS 2T-Transportation (3.6; 95% CI 0.7C18) and 92F-Fuel specialist/ground and aircraft (6.8; 95% CI 1.5C30), as well as black race (2.2; 95% CI 1.2C4.1), household size 6 (2.5; 95% CI 1.3C4.6) and known COVID-19 exposure (2.0; 95% CI 1.2C3.3).

Although many viruses encode RNA helicases and chaperones, their in vitro activities and their roles in infected cells largely remain elusive. Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Caliciviridae and constitute a significant and potentially fatal threat to human health. Here, we report that the protein NS3 encoded by human norovirus has both ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices and ATP-independent RNA-chaperoning activity that can remodel structured RNAs and facilitate strand annealing. Moreover, NS3 can facilitate viral RNA synthesis in vitro by norovirus polymerase. NS3 may therefore play an important role in norovirus RNA replication. Lastly, we demonstrate that the RNA-remodeling activity of NS3 is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound, and, more importantly, that it reduces the replication of the norovirus replicon in cultured human cells. Altogether, these findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of RNA-remodeling activities encoded by Caliciviridae and highlight the functional significance of NS3 in the noroviral life cycle.IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses, which annually cause hundreds of millions of human infections and over 200,000 deaths worldwide. For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases and/or chaperones have long been considered to play pivotal roles in viral life cycles. However, neither RNA helicase nor chaperoning activity has been demonstrated to be associated with any norovirus-encoded proteins, and it is also unknown whether norovirus replication requires the participation of any viral or cellular RNA helicases/chaperones. We found that a norovirus protein, NS3, not only has ATP-dependent helicase activity, but also acts as an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. Also, NS3 can facilitate in vitro viral RNA synthesis, suggesting the important role of NS3 in norovirus replication. Moreover, NS3 activities can be inhibited by an FDA-approved compound, which also suppresses norovirus replicon replication in human cells, raising the possibility that NS3 could be a target for antinoroviral drug development.","output":"Human Norovirus NS3 Has RNA Helicase and Chaperoning Activities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mass immunization is the prioritised post-pandemic phase offering preventive countermeasure for COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we have discussed how Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities are genetically different from the native inhabitants of Britain and hence why BAME groups are affected more by the virus and being closely related to the human population origins and migrations. This work represents our view and understanding of the current situation and it has emphasised on population genetic analysis, that is vital to understand and control the novel coronavirus. Some important prevention strategies have also been recommended in this work including path to improved health and natural ways to boost body's immune system. ? 2021 Author(s).","output":"Analysis of why Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups in the UK are harder hit by COVID-19, and how to minimise the risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic management of a benign ovarian mass is regarded as the best surgical approach in many cases.

The situation is more difficult for people with disabilities (PWD), even more in the COVID-19 crisis, especially in terms of labour inclusion (due to the labour discrimination usually suffered by this collective). Thus, Special Employment Centres (SEC) have been created in Spain to spread protected employment of PWD. Although they are improving the situation in the short term, the long-term impact developing sustainable employment is not clear. The objective of this paper is to analyze the Spanish situation, the possible differences between sheltered employment and the ordinary labour market, how SEC could be improving (or not) their labour situation in the hotel sector in the long term, and the potential of incorporating Corporate Social Marketing to overcome the problem. Methods: A content bibliographic analysis has been carried out according to the latest research about this topic, using a ProKnow-C methodology. Results: There seems to be two different groups of papers (supply and demand sides), being the supply side one (focused on HR practices about PWD inclusion and managers perceptions of workers with disabilities) more related to our research objective. Furthermore, few articles were found about SEC and Corporate Social Marketing in relation to this topic, highlighting the originality of this research approach. Conclusions: According to our bibliographic portfolio, the presence of labour discrimination in the regular market is more evident;and, in the long term, two opposite situations could be happening simultaneously: (a) SEC would be reinforcing the social stigma, hindering the labour situation of PWD;(b) SEC could be changing the social perspectives of clients and all society in a positive manner. Therefore, it would be necessary to go in-depth into the present subject, from an academic but also practical perspective, incorporating an innovative Corporate Social Marketing approach in order to shed new light on this issue and improving effective sustainable employment of PWD.","output":"Special Employment Centres, Time Factor and Sustainable Human Resources Management in Spanish Hotel Industry: Can Corporate Social Marketing Improve the Labour Situation of People with Disabilities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research activities with infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are currently permitted only under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment. Here, we report the development of a single-cycle infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus replicon particle (VRP) system with a luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) dual reporter that can be safely handled in BSL2 laboratories to study SARS-CoV-2 biology. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the envelope glycoprotein, which is essential for mediating infection of new host cells. Through deletion and replacement of this essential S gene with a luciferase and GFP dual reporter, we have generated a conditional SARS-CoV-2 mutant (Delta S-VRP) that produces infectious particles only in cells expressing a viral envelope glycoprotein of choice. Interestingly, we observed more efficient production of infectious particles in cells expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein G [Delta S-VRP(G)] than in cells expressing other viral glycoproteins, including S. We confirmed that infection from Delta S-VRP(G) is limited to a single round and can be neutralized by anti-VSV serum. In our studies with Delta S-VRP(G), we observed robust expression of both luciferase and GFP reporters in various human and murine cell types, demonstrating that a broad variety of cells can support intracellular replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, treatment of Delta S-VRP(G)-infected cells with either of the anti-CoV drugs remdesivir (nucleoside analog) and GC376 (CoV 3CL protease inhibitor) resulted in a robust decrease in both luciferase and GFP expression in a drug dose-and cell-type-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings show that we have developed a single-cycle infectious SARS-CoV-2 VRP system that serves as a versatile platform to study SARS-CoV-2 intracellular biology and to perform high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs under BSL2 containment. IMPORTANCE Due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of immunity in the human population, research on SARS-CoV-2 has been restricted to biosafety level 3 laboratories. This has greatly limited participation of the broader scientific community in SARS-CoV-2 research and thus has hindered the development of vaccines and anti-viral drugs. By deleting the essential spike gene in the viral genome, we have developed a conditional mutant of SARS-CoV-2 with luciferase and fluorescent reporters, which can be safely used under biosafety level 2 conditions. Our single-cycle infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus replicon system can serve as a versatile platform to study SARS-CoV-2 intracellular biology and to perform high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs under BSL2 containment.","output":"Development of a Single-Cycle Infectious SARS-CoV-2 Virus Replicon Particle System for Use in Biosafety Level 2 Laboratories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of biologic agents represents a remarkable advance for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who have experienced an incomplete response to other therapeutic modalities. Decreased mortality and improved quality of life have been reported in patients undergoing treatment with these agents. Increased risk of bacterial, viral, granulomatous, and opportunistic infections also has been associated with the use of these medications. Enhanced patient education, watchful monitoring to promote early detection of infections, discontinuation of the medication when clinical symptoms are identified, and immediate availability of supportive care are advised to balance the benefit of treatment with biologic agents against the potential risk of infection. Herein, we discuss the risk of infection and the monitoring and vaccination guidelines in patients having psoriasis treated with biologic agents. OBSERVATIONS A woman with obesity and psoriasis that had previously been successfully treated with efalizumab (Raptiva) for 3 years was started on a regimen of infliximab (Remicade) to treat a flare.

Few studies of viral evolution account for variations of mutation rate across a single gene. This is especially true when considering evolution of segmented viruses where individual segments are short, encoding for few proteins. However, the structural and functional partitions of these proteins could provide valuable information for more accurate inference of viral evolution, due to the disparate immune selection pressure on different functional domains. Accurately reconstructed evolutionary features on specific functional domains can in turn provide biological information on viral protein and immune targets for vaccine design. In this study I developed and evaluated a structurally informed partitioning scheme that accounts for rate variation among immunogenic head and stalk domains of the surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses. I evaluated the model fit and performance of four different models - HKY, SRD06 codon, HKY with a structurally informed partitioning scheme, SRD06 with a structurally informed partitioning scheme on pandemic A/H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/H1N1postpdm, A/H3N2, B-Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages, and two highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses H5Nx and H7N9. Results showed that structurally informed partitioning with SRD06 performed better for all datasets with decisively statistical support. Significantly faster nucleotide substitution rates for head domain, compared to stalk domain was observed and may provide insight for stalk derived universal vaccine design.

Hence, microplastic pollution is globally flagged as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity in recent time as they are found nearly everywhere in the environment. While, the world confronts the plastic problem and transitions towards a circular system, turning the ubiquitous plastic loads around requires both momentum and careful navigation. So far, if the burning of plastics and the accumulation of the materials in oceans and landfill is to be reduced, the industry cannot continue to manufacture plastics at the current rate. Objectives: This paper explores public health knowledge and perception of microplastics pollution Methods: : Data analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 20.0) and a significance difference was established at 5% with p<0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Results: : The result reveals that out of the 102 respondents that participated in the study, 59 respondents representing 57.8% were aware of microplastic pollution. Nonetheless, a significant association between awareness of microplastic pollution and the category of workers (p =0.004, p<0.05) was observed. The mean score on knowledge of microplastic is less than the expected weighted mean of 3.00 for 5 points rating scale which implies that the respondents have poor knowledge of microplastic pollution though they show better knowledge of the serious global problem of microplastic pollution than other knowledge items. Result also indicates that the mean score on perception is greater than 3.00 (3.32) which indicates that the respondents have a good perception of microplastic pollution. Conclusion: There is a need to strengthen advocacy coalition framework (ACF) communication and learning for the determination towards improving the opportunities to protect public interests, including a thorough review of all policy processes, with policy change. This will help highlight the learning importance and involving citizen stakeholders participation through observing risk communication on environmental pollutants menace while advancing citizen risk perception, thus influencing risk perception on plastic pollution, as well as the citizens involvement in such environmental problems. Hence, research role as well as creating education awareness will help enlighten the development of policy on the dangers of plastic pollution.","output":"Public Health Knowledge and Perception of Microplastics Pollution: Lessons from the Lagos Lagoon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To improve communication and collaboration among health professionals, interprofessional education (IPE) experiences have been offered to students through the Utah Geriatric Education Consortium (UGEC) with the support of long-term care (LTC) partners since 2017.

The secondary aim was to analyze acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in COVID-19. Methods: A database of confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients who developed acute neurological symptoms and underwent any neuroimaging was retrospectively gathered from twelve institutions based in Lombardy from February 21st to July 10th. To assess the prevalence of CVD we conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA extension guidelines for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS and EMBASE databases for peer-reviewed in-press or published studies from December to January 2021 reporting CVD in COVID-19 patients. Results: Out of 90 COVID-19 patients who were referred to neuroimaging, 78 (87%) showed CVD, in particular 65 had acute ischemic strokes (AIS), 8 had intracerebral hemorrhages, 2 subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) and 3 showed clinical and imaging findings in keeping with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES);6 patients (7%) showed clinical and imaging findings highly suggestive of encephalitis;3 patients (3%) showed demyelinating diseases: 1 case of MS progression, 1 case of newly diagnosed MS and 1 case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM);2 cases (2%) acuity of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH);1 patient (1%) with Guillain Barr syndrome. In addiction two patients with CVD developed cauda polyradiculitis and tetraparesis. In our scoping review out of 3275 studies, 24 satisfied the inclusion criteria: in a pooled total population of 136198 patients, the pooled prevalence of CVD was 0.9%. In particular 0.8% of AIS and 0.1% of ICH and 0.003% of PRES. Conclusions: Our study shows a high prevalence of CVD among patients who developed acute neurological symptoms, which is in line with papers reporting data comparable to ours. The heterogeneity of clinical reports, however, constitutes a limitation when comparing our findings with those of the clinical papers. Nonetheless, CVD could be a frightening association with COVID-19, particularly in critically ill patients.

Despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates are still prevalent. The present study aimed to characterize mucoid-type S. pneumoniae isolated from IPD patients throughout Japan in 2017 (post-vaccination era). METHODS A total of 225 mucoid-type isolates were collected. The serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, and multilocus sequence type of these isolates were determined. RESULTS The prevalence of IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates was high in adults, especially in the elderly (65 years of age), and prognosis in these patients was significantly poor. Of the mucoid-type isolates, the predominant serotype was serotype 3 (84.4%), and the remaining were serotypes 37 (15.1%) and 8 (0.4%). Antimicrobial susceptibility showed that most mucoid isolates exhibited the penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPISP). However, the serotype 3 isolate exhibited the penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPRSP). This gPRSP isolate was classified into ST166, which is related to serotypes 9 V and 11 strains. Sequence analysis of the capsule-coding regions and its flanking regions indicated that recombination occurred upstream and downstream of the capsule-coding region, suggesting that gPRSP (serotype 9 V/ST166) obtaining the type-3 capsule gene cluster resulted in the emergence of gPRSP (serotype 3/ST166). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated that IPDs caused by mucoid-type S. pneumoniae are still a serious concern and mucoid-type S. pneumoniae with novel phenotype could emerge via capsular switching in response to environmental changes such as introduction of vaccines and improper use of antimicrobial agents.","output":"Molecular epidemiological characterization in mucoid-type Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from invasive pneumococcal disease patients in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viroporins, which are encoded by a wide range of animal viruses, oligomerize in host cell membranes and form hydrophilic pores that can disrupt a number of physiological properties of the cell. Little is known about the relationship between host cell proteins and viroporin activity. The human JC polyomavirus (JCV) is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The JCV-encoded agnoprotein, which is essential for viral replication, has been shown to act as a viroporin. Here we demonstrate that the JCV agnoprotein specifically interacts with adaptor protein complex 3 through its  subunit. This interaction interrupts adaptor protein complex 3-mediated vesicular trafficking with suppression of the targeting of the protein to the lysosomal degradation pathway and instead permits the transport of agnoprotein to the cell surface with resulting membrane permeabilization. The findings demonstrate a previously undescribed paradigm in virus-host interactions allowing the host to regulate viroporin activity and suggest that the viroporins of other viruses may also be highly regulated by specific interactions with host cell proteins.","output":"Viroporin activity of the JC polyomavirus is regulated by interactions with the adaptor protein complex 3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness that serious illness and injury are common and important shocks that result in food insecurity, the loss of livelihoods, and unsustainable coping strategies.

Clinical features and results of the immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 were collected and analyzed. Results: ACE2 expressed in alveolar macrophages (most obvious), alveolar epithelia and vascular endothelia, but not in small-airway epithelia.

Mean levels of vitamin D were significantly lower among British-Bangladeshis compared to Bangladeshi sedentees (50.9nmol/L +/- 13.3), presumably due to less exposure to sunlight following migration; levels were also lower than in white British women (55.3nmol/L +/- 20.9). Lower levels of vitamin D were associated with increased body mass index and low iron status. Conclusions and implications: Recommending supplements to Bangladeshi migrants could prevent potentially adverse health outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency.","output":"Mismatch: A comparative study of vitamin D status in British-Bangladeshi migrants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 Pandemic demonstrated the importance of rapid, accurate, point of care testing to control spread of the virus. The availability of this testing has been crucial to re-opening schools, keeping children safely in schools, and returning children to school quickly following illness. The Abbott ID Now molecular assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 was granted Emergency Use Authorization in March 2020. Reports of lower sensitivity compared with conventional PCR prompted some school districts to require confirmatory conventional PCR for negative rapid molecular results to return children to school. In this study we aim to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott ID NOW molecular SARS-CoV-2 test in a large pediatric primary care practice. Methods A retrospective observational study was performed using data from 25 pediatric primary care sites in the Boston Childrens Health Physicians network, a large multispecialty pediatric practice in New York and Connecticut. Data were extracted from the electronic health record for all patients 0-22 years of age who had an Abbott ID NOW rapid molecular COVID-19 assay from October 1, 2020 - February 28, 2021. For all patients with rapid tests, we identified patients who had a conventional PCR test sent within 1 day before or 1 day after the ID NOW test. The result of the conventional PCR test was considered the true result. All discrepant test results were identified. Results During the study period, 14993 patients had ID NOW testing performed. The percent positivity was 8.5%. The percent positivity in our practices paralleled that in the surrounding community throughout the winter surge of COVID-19. 500 patients had confirmatory testing sent within 1 day before or after the ID NOW test (15 positive and 485 negative results). Based on the conventional PCR test results, 2 of 15 positive results were false positive and only 1 of 485 negative results was a false negative, resulting in a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 99.6%. The false negative result was in a patient with nasal congestion whose mother was COVID positive. Conclusion Rapid, molecular, point of care testing is an important tool to identify SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients and limit school absences. The ID NOW assay is highly sensitive and specific in a real-world pediatric setting.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore healthcare workers, parents and childcare providers' perceptions of the pandemic's influence on how they engage with infants to promote physical activity, muscle strength and communication. METHODS: 37 subjects (12 = parents; 12 = childcare providers, 13 = healthcare workers) participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analyzed via an inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of caregivers identified concerns related to: limitations in social interactions (especially masks impacting communication), lack of access to peer modeling, fewer opportunities for physical exploration, and a need for creative activities in diverse environments (e.g., home/childcare) for infant development during and after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are concerned about the role COVID-19 is having on infant development.

To identify the causal effects of the school closure, we exploited the discontinuity in the probability of not going to school at a certain threshold of age in months and conducted fuzzy regression discontinuity analyses. The data are from a large-scale online survey of mothers whose firstborn children were aged 4 to 10 years. The results revealed a large increase in childrens weight and in mothers anxiety over how to raise their children.

However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. Methods: : C57Bl/6J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50mg/kg IP every 2 nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7 days. After 21 days, i n situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. Results: : CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. Conclusion: Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","output":"Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia, and can be modulated by chloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking gut dysbiosis and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are poorly understood, although gut microbiota disorders are related to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. The roles of the gut microbiota in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those in respiratory viral infection, which is an easily understood and enlightening analogy. Secondary bacterial infections caused by immune disorders and antibiotic abuse can lead to dysregulation of the gut microbiota in patients with respiratory viral infections. The gut microbiota can influence the progression of respiratory viral infections through metabolites and the immune response, which is known as the gutClung axis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is expressed in both the lungs and the small intestine, which may be a bridge between the lung and the gut. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to disturb the gut microbiota, which may be the cause of cytokine storms. Bacteria in the gut, lung, and other tissues and respiratory viruses can be considered microecosystems and may exert overall effects on the host.

METHODS: A retrospective case control study was performed to analyze the clinical data of 35 patients with FFP who were treated and followed up between January 2016 and December 2019. There were 12 males and 23 females, aged from 65 to 99 years with an average of(75.47.8) years old. There were 13 cases of type a ?b, 7 cases of type a ?c, 8 cases of type a a, 2 cases of type a b, 2 cases of type a c, 1 case of type a b, and 2 cases of type a c according to Rommens FFP comprehensive classification. All patients received the treatment of minimally invasive technology with trajectory screws fixation. According to the different methods of anterior pelvic ring fixation, FFP patients were divided into two groups:12 cases were fixed with the pedicle screw rod system in the anterior pelvic subcutaneous internal fixator (INFIX) group;23 cases were fixed with hollow screws of the pubic symphysis, superior ramus of pubis or acetabular anterior column in the screw group. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, length of hospital stay, cost of internal fixation, pre- and post-operative visual analogue scale(VAS) were compared between the two groups. The fracture reduction quality was evaluated according to the Matta criteria, and the clinical function was evaluated by the Majeed functional scoring system respectively. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12 to 39(16.55.4) months after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, and length of hospital stay between the two groups(P>0.05). As for the cost of internal fixation, the cost of internal fixation in the screw group [2 914 (2 914, 4 371) yuan] was significantly lower than that of the INFIX group [6 205 (6 205, 6 205) yuan] (P<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS assessment at admission, 1 week, and 3 months after surgery between the two groups(P>0.05). However, the VAS assessment at 1 week and 3 months after surgery of the two groups were significantly better than those at admission(P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the quality of fracture reduction after the operation and the efficacy evaluation at the last follow-up between the two groups(P>0.05).

Elevation of their plasmatic level has been reported in a variety of infectious and cardiovascular disorders, but the clinical use of this potential biomarker is hampered by methodological issues. Although flow cytometry (FCM) is currently used to detect NDEVs in the plasma of patients, an extensive characterization of NDEVs has never been done. Moreover, their detection remains challenging because of their small size and low antigen density. Therefore, the objective of the present study was first to establish a surface antigenic signature of NDEVs detectable by FCM and therefore to improve their detection in biological fluids by developing a strategy allowing to overcome their low fluorescent signal and reduce the background noise. By testing a large panel of 54 antibody specificities already reported to be positive on PMNs, we identified a profile of 15 membrane protein markers, including 4 (CD157, CD24, CD65 and CD66c) never described on NDEVs. Among them, CD15, CD66b and CD66c were identified as the most sensitive and specific markers to detect NDEVs by FCM. Using this antigenic signature, we developed a new strategy combining the three best antibodies in a cocktail and reducing the background noise by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This strategy allowed a significant improvement in NDEVs enumeration in plasma from sepsis patients and made it feasible to efficiently sort NDEVs from COVID\\\\19 patients. Altogether, this work opens the door to a more valuable measurement of NDEVs as a potential biomarker in clinical practice.

To curb the spread of the virus many institutions restricted non-emergent clinic appointments, resulting in an increase in telemedicine use. We examined the value of telemedicine for patients presenting to a pediatric surgery clinic before and after COVID-19 METHODS: Perspectives and the potential value of telemedicine were assessed by surveying patients or caregivers of patients being evaluated by a general pediatric surgeon in-person prior to COVID-19 and by patients or caregivers of patients who completed a telemedicine appointment with a pediatric surgical provider during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The pre-COVID survey was completed by 57 respondents and the post-COVID survey by 123. Most respondents were white and were caregivers 31-40 years of age. Prior to COVID-19, only 26% were familiar with telemedicine, 25% reported traveling more than 100 miles and >50% traveled more than 40 miles for their appointment. More than 25% estimated additional travel costs of at least $30 and in 43% of households, at least one adult had to miss time from work. Following a telemedicine appointment during the COVID-19 period, 76% reported the care received as excellent, 86% were very satisfied with their care, 87% reported the appointment was less stressful for their child than an in-person appointment, and 57% would choose a telemedicine appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: For families seeking an alternative to the in-person encounter, telemedicine can provide added value over the traditional in-person encounter by reducing the burden of travel without compromising the quality of care.

Currently, four vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany, and vaccination campaigns have been started nationwide. In this respect, it is of utmost importance to give recommendations on possible immunological interactions and potential risks of immunomodulatory substances (monoclonal antibodies, biologicals) during concurrent vaccination with the approved vaccines. Methods: This position paper provides specific recommendations on the use of immunomodulatory drugs in the context of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations based on current literature. Results: The recommendations are covering the following conditions in which biologicals are indicated and approved: i) chronic inflammatory skin diseases (atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria), ii) bronchial asthma, and iii) chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Patients with atopic dermatitis or chronic spontaneous urticaria are not at increased risk for allergic reactions after COVID-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, vaccination may result in transient eczema exacerbation due to general immune stimulation. Vaccination in patients receiving systemic therapy with biologicals can be performed. Patients with severe asthma and concomitant treatment with biologicals also do not have an increased risk of allergic reaction following COVID-19 vaccination which is recommended in these patients. Patients with CRSwNP are also not known to be at increased risk for allergic vaccine reactions, and continuation or initiation of a treatment with biologicals is also recommended with concurrent COVID-19 vaccination. In general, COVID-19 vaccination should be given within the interval between two applications of the respective biological, that is, with a time-lag of at least 1 week after the previous or at least 1 week before the next biological treatment planned. Conclusion: Biologicals for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, bronchial asthma, and CRSwNP should be continued during the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

The catalyst for the development of the network was the underrepresentation of female participants in sport and exercise medicine research (Costello, Bieuzen, & Bleakley, 2014). Due to this underrepresentation, research evidence based on men is often inappropriately generalized and applied to women (Sims & Heather, 2018). Gender bias is also apparent in conference speakers and academic panel members (Bekker et al., 2018) as well as in leadership positions in sport (Pape, 2020), where males consistently outnumber females. The network, therefore, exists to help minimize gender inequalities in research and academia, through promoting female-focused research as part of the annual conference and by supporting female researchers through its mentoring scheme. Further activities of WiSEAN can be found on the website: https://www.wisean.net/. Introduction to the 2020 Conference: Getting Back on Their Feet Owing to COVID-19, which in many countries led to restrictions regarding travel and public gatherings, the planned 2020 face-to-face conference was replaced with a free virtual event, hosted by Staffordshire University, UK. With early research evidence suggesting that COVID-19 had heightened gender inequalities in sport, employment, and academia (Bowes, Lomax, & Piasecki, 2020;Collins, Landivar, Ruppanner, & Scarborough, 2020;Oleschuk, 2020), the focus of the conference, getting back on their feet, aimed to virtually connect individuals from a range of disciplines to ensure that sport and exercise research had a focus on women during COVID-19 and beyond. The conference also provided networking opportunities to connect with others in sport and exercise, as well as providing training and motivation through knowledge gained via others research and experience. The Conference Scientific Committee comprised Dr. Jacky Forsyth (Staffordshire University), Dr. Rachael Bullingham (University of Gloucestershire), Dr. Nicola Brown (St Marys University), and Dr. Claire-Marie Roberts (Premier League, UK), with technical direction from Mr. Matthew Coombe-Boxall (Staffordshire University). Conference Review A total of 474 delegates registered for the event from 37 different countries. Most delegates were from the United Kingdom, with high numbers also joining from the United States, Qatar, and Australia. The virtual conference was specifically designed to allow delegates the flexibility to join sessions ad hoc, with sessions running over an extended time period to accommodate international time zones. Consequently, the number of delegates viewing each session varied throughout the course of the conference, reaching a peak of 126. Given this was WiSEANs first online event, the Conference Committee were keen to obtain feedback from delegates to feedforward for future virtual events. Conference evaluations were overwhelmingly positive, with the breadth, quality, and style of presentations rated highly. All those who completed the survey said that they would recommend the event to others. Some examples of the comments left by delegates are as follows: Brilliant online conference with a great variety of speakers and topics. Ill be taking away lots of learning and potential contacts to follow up with! The ability to have some of the worlds leading experts because of the virtual nature of the event was a strength of the conference. Having people from all different backgrounds/disciplines but all working towards increasing the presence of women in research was inspiring. I found the conference inspirational and stimulating and has fired me up to be an advocate for more research on females and ensure research on females is better represented in our curriculum. Suggested areas for improvement included more opportunities for collaborative and face-to-face (online) communication via the chat facility, which was difficult to negotiate for some delegates. Additionally, comments were received about the duration of the conference days, lasting all day and into the evening;however, in order to accommodate international speakers and delegates, this was unavoidable. Looking Ahead The fourth WiSEAN conference will take place on April 19C22, 2021 and will be hosted virtually by the University of Worcester, UK. This conference will maintain the multidisciplinary approach of previous years and will cover all aspects of womens involvement in sport. The conference will have an international focus and aim to bring together practitioners and academics from a range of disciplines to allow discussion and debate surrounding womens participation in sport, exercise, and physical activity. The conference has been titled Redressing the Balance and the purpose of the conference is to raise awareness and address inequalities from both an academics and practitioners perspective, in addition to assessing impact and sharing areas of good practice. On day four, there will be a parallel virtual conference, as part of a European CommissionCfunded Erasmus+ project which the University of Worcester is leading with six other international partners. The project is entitled the Gender Equity Toolkit for Generation Z (an educational online resource via a MOOC [massive open online course]) and aims to educate Generation Z in issues of equity in sport with the purpose of increasing the number of women and girls in all forms of sport leadership and management. The impact and implications for practice from this three-year project will be shared along with key research studies focusing on gender perceptions, communication, and Generation Z.
