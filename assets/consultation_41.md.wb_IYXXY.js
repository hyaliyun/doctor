The disease is highly contagious, and it may lead to acute respiratory distress (ARD). Medical imaging can play an important role in classifying, detecting, and measuring the severity of the virus. This study aims to provide a novel auto-detection tool that can detect abnormal changes in conventional X-ray images for confirmed COVID-19 cases. X-ray images from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were converted into 19 different colored layers. Each layer represented objects with similar contrast that could be defined as a specific color. The objects with similar contrasts were formed in a single layer. All the objects from all the layers were extracted as a single-color image. Based on the differentiation of colors, the prototype model was able to recognize a wide spectrum of abnormal changes in the image texture. This was true even if there was minimal variation of the contrast values of the detected uncleared abnormalities. The results indicate that the proposed novel method can detect and determine the degree of lung infection from COVID-19 with an accuracy of 91%, compared to the opinions of three experienced radiologists. The method can also efficiently determine the sites of infection and the severity of the disease by classifying the X-rays into five levels of severity. Thus, the proposed COVID-19 autodetection method can identify locations and indicate the degree of severity of the disease by comparing affected tissue with healthy tissue, and it can predict where the disease may spread.","output":"A Novel Computational Model for Detecting the Severity of Inflammation in Confirmed COVID-19 Patients Using Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the relation between COVID-19 vaccine coverage and COVID-19-related mortality by age groups in Brazil in 2021. METHODS Secondary data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination coverage were retrieved to investigate COVID-19 mortality rate (MR) evolution as the vaccination against COVID-19 advanced in Brazil in 2021. Poisson regression with adjustment for age and Brazilian states was used to calculate the MR. RESULTS By mid-April 2021, MR increased 2 - 3 times compared with the already high level in January for people aged 60 years or older, reaching the highest epidemic level of 5 - 15 per 100,000 inhabitants in this age group. Despite the following decline trend, by the end of May, the MR level was still about 50% and 80% higher for the age groups of 40 - 79 years and 80 years or older. The coverage concerning the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine reached 80% for people aged 60 - 69 years and exceeded 95% for those aged 70 years or older, but the second dose was only given to 26, 76 and 64% of the age groups of 60 - 69, 70 - 79, and 80 years or older, respectively. The age-standardized average MR over the study period was the highest in northern Brazilian states of Rond?nia, Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima (range 6-8.4 per 100,000 inhabitants). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 vaccination coverage was below the level necessary to protect Brazilians from rising MR between January and May 2021.

COVID-19 and other vaccines, however, are only licenced for intramuscular application. AIMS: To assess the safety of intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination in patients living with haemophilia. METHODS: Part A of this prospective observational study enrolled consecutive patients with haemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) of all ages and severities and assessed injection site bleeding and other complications within 30 days of vaccination. Part B enrolled patients providing informed consent for detailed data collection including medication and prophylaxis around the time of vaccination. Logistic regression was performed to assess potential risk factors for bleeding. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-one patients were enrolled into part A. The primary endpoint injection site bleeding occurred in seven patients (1.5%, 95% confidence interval .7-3.1%). Comprehensive analysis of 214 patients (404 vaccinations, part B) revealed that 97% of patients with severe haemophilia had prophylaxis before vaccination, either as part of their routine prophylaxis or using additional doses. 56% and 30% of patients with moderate and mild haemophilia, respectively, received prophylaxis before vaccination. Among the seven bleeds recorded, three occurred when intramuscular vaccination was done without prophylaxis (odds ratio 12).

A general awareness of COVID-19 infection is addressed, and it is compared with the Spanish flu pandemic. Based on the successes, failures and lessons learned in the past, governmental efforts must be undertaken to empower citizens by providing accurate information and implementing post-COVID-19 precautions that need to be taken now to stop the spread and recurrence of the virus locally, and to restore health and economic normalcy. Methods: A detailed literature survey of past pandemics is undertaken in order to extract the successes, failures and lessons learned from previous breakouts. The comparison of past pandemics will enable us to determine post-COVID-19 precautions that should be followed. Separate tables are prepared to highlight the lessons learned and measures to be taken. Both general precautions and preventive measures for pregnant women are compiled. Results: The literature shows a continuous struggle of humans with disease outbreaks, with the most adverse impact of the Spanish flu killing 20-50 million people. Precautions need to be taken including social distancing, compulsory mask-wearing, avoiding public gatherings and washing hands regularly. The lessons from earlier pandemics show that they were equally devastating, and vaccines were not available at the time of outbreaks. Vaccines developed for polio, H1N1, measles, and other viral diseases have proven to save countless lives. Living with COVID-19 and evolving the work culture of protecting oneself and protecting others also has to be adopted. Conclusions: COVID-19 has become an everyday topic of discussion throughout the world, indicating the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. The lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding public gatherings and adherence to guidelines, along with personal hygiene, are the key measures that must be taken in order to live with COVID-19. Precautions for the elderly and pregnant women advised by medical authorities are to be strictly adhered to. These will help in reducing COVID-19 cases and in turn will reduce the pressure on hospitals to serve those in need.

We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both M(pro) and PL(pro) proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the M(pro) protease and no viable hits for the PL(pro) protease. Of the M(pro) hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead M(pro) inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of M(pro) inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsins L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Our results highlight the challenges of targeting M(pro) and PL(pro) proteases and demonstrate the need to carefully assess selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to prevent clinical advancement of compounds that function through inhibition of a redundant viral entry pathway.","output":"Challenges for Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Proteases as a Therapeutic Strategy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions worldwide, therefore there is an urgent need to increase our diagnostic capacity to identify infected cases. Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several groups have recently reported the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes. Incorporation of RT-LAMP with fluorescent detection further increases the detection sensitivity to as little as 100 RNA copies. We also note the shortcomings of some LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions and clinical saliva samples. Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have faster kinetics for detection but varying degrees of false positives detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30 min reaction time, which highlights the importance of optimal primer design to minimise false-positives in RT-LAMP.

As a devastating event in the world, many people suffer the PTSD from this severe disease. The aim of study is to explore the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and discuss the possible factors among the general public in China after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. We used the self-designed demographic questionnaire and the Posttraumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) of Chinese version as our screening tools to investigate 4872 subjects living in the communities in China from Nov. 8th, 2020 to Dec. 8th, 2020. Results Finally, we received 3705 effective respondents. The response rates of the questionnaire can reach 76.97 percentage. Peculiarly, the prevalence of PTSD mild and severe symptoms after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak was 53.2%. Mild PTSD symptoms accounted for 24.9%, and severe PTSD symptoms (scores above 38) accounted for 28.3%. PCL-C mean scores were 41.414.7. The females accounted for 67.7% of the total samples. Participants mean age was 30.511.2 years old. The PCL-C gross scores of females were all higher than males in four subject groups. Meantime, gender and age made differences not only in total PCL-C points but also in the four aspects of PCL-C (P<0.001). The middle-aged group (ages from 45 to 60) got the lowest scores among the four groups. Conclusion COVID-19 brought tremendous psychological pressure on the public in many ways, including peoples work, social contact, study, and daily life. Results of our research discover that symptoms of the PTSD are severe, including the re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, flashbacks, and hyper-arousal. Actions should be taken at society level to prevent and protect individuals from PTSD suffering. Special attention should be paid to females and young people.

We examined the impact of Covid-19 on the lived experience of systemic sclerosis with regards to other aspects of daily living including occupation and emotional well-being. Method Individuals with systemic sclerosis or relatives/carers participated in an online survey, disseminated through international patient associations and social media pages, designed to examine the impact of Covid-19 on living with a rare disease. Results Responses from 121 individuals (98% were patients with systemic sclerosis) from 14 countries were evaluable. Covid-19 was considered a probable/definite personal threat (93%) or threat for the individual they care for (100%). Approximately two-thirds of responders reported either cancellation or postponement/delay to appointments, diagnostic tests, medical therapies at home (e.g. infusions), surgery or transplant, psychiatry follow-up or rehabilitation services. Twenty-six percent reported at least one systemic sclerosis medicine/treatment had been unavailable, and 6% had to either stop taking usual medications or use an alternative. Most reported online consultations/telemedicine via phone (88%) and online (96%) as being 'fairly' or 'very' useful.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first and exhaustive review of kurarinone. The literature was obtained from different search engine platforms including PubMed. Kurarinone possesses anticancer potential against cervical, lung (non-small and small), hepatic, esophageal, breast, gastric, cervical, and prostate cancer cells. In vivo anticancer potential of kurarinone has been extensively studied in lungs (non-small and small) using experimental xenograft models. In in vitro anticancer studies, kurarinone showed IC(50) in the range of 2C62 M while in vivo efficacy was studied in the range of 20C500 mg/kg body weight of the experimental organism. The phytochemical showed higher selectivity toward cancer cells in comparison to respective normal cells. kurarinone inhibits cell cycle progression in G2/M and Sub-G1 phase in a cancer-specific context. It induces apoptosis in cancer cells by modulating molecular players involved in apoptosis/anti-apoptotic processes such as NF-B, caspase 3/8/9/12, Bcl2, Bcl-XL, etc. The phytochemical inhibits metastasis in cancer cells by modulating the protein expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9. It produces a cytostatic effect by modulating p21, p27, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin A proteins in cancer cells. Kurarinone possesses stress-mediated anticancer activity and modulates STAT3 and Akt pathways. Besides, the literature showed that kurarinone possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-drug resistance, anti-microbial (fungal, yeast, bacteria, and Coronavirus), channel and transporter modulation, neuroprotection, and estrogenic activities as well as tyrosinase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase/glucosidase/aldose reductase/human carboxylesterases 2 inhibitory potential.

A modified Delphi exercise was used to build the structural report and to assess the level of agreement for all the report sections. The Cronbachs alpha (C) correlation coefficient was used to assess internal consistency for each section and to perform a quality analysis according to the average inter-item correlation. Results: The final SR version was built by including 16 items in the Patient Clinical Data section, 4 items in the Clinical Evaluation section, 8 items in the Exam Technique section, 22 items in the Report section, and 5 items in the Conclusion section. Overall, 55 items were included in the final version of the SR. The overall mean of the scores of the experts and the sum of scores for the structured report were 4.5 (range 1C5) and 631 (mean value 67.54, STD 7.53), respectively, in the first round. The items of the structured report with higher accordance in the first round were primary lesion features, lymph nodes, metastasis and conclusions.

This proposal is in line with the OSG/WLCG strategy for addressing computing for HL-LHC and is aligned with European and other international strategies in computing for large scale science. The European Strategy for Particle Physics in 2020 agreed to the principles laid out above, in its final report.","output":"HEP computing collaborations for the challenges of the next decade"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a routine clinical procedure performed to treat patients with haematological malignancies, primary immune deficiencies or metabolic disorders. Infections during lymphopenia after allogeneic HSCT are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Typical infectious agents are EpsteinCBarr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella\\\\zoster virus and fungi. The study aim was to evaluate whether measurement of the responses of antigen\\\\specific T\\\\cells, recognizing infectious pathogens would correlate to protective functions in the stem cell recipient post\\\\transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty\\\\one grafts were analysed by flow cytometry and cells were stimulated in vitro with relevant infectious antigens, followed by evaluation of T\\\\cell proliferation and cytokine production. Results were compared to the recipients clinical records 1\\\\year post\\\\transplantation. RESULTS: We show that an extensive repertoire of transferred antigen\\\\specific T\\\\cells from allogeneic donor grafts against infectious agents, involved in post\\\\transplant infections, are linked to an absence of infectious complications for the recipient up\\\\to 1\\\\year post\\\\transplant. The protective effect was associated with antigen\\\\specific T\\\\cell proliferation and IL\\\\1 secretion. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that assaying T\\\\cell function before HSCT could determine individual risks for infectious complications and thus aid in clinical decision\\\\making regarding prophylactic and pre\\\\emptive anti\\\\infective therapy.","output":"Functionality testing of stem cell grafts to predict infectious complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nod\\\\like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome drives inflammation in response to mitochondrial dysfunction.

This study aimed to (1) assemble C. virginica mitochondrial genomes from Texas with pooled restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (ezRAD), (2) evaluate the validity of the mitochondrial genome assemblies including comparison with Sanger sequencing data, and (3) evaluate genetic differentiation both between the Delaware and Texas genomes, as well as among three bays in Texas. The pooled-genome-assembled-genomes (PAGs) from Texas exhibited several characteristics indicating that they were valid, including elevated nucleotide diversity in non-coding and the third position of codons, placement as the sister haplotype of the genome from Delaware in a phylogenetic reconstruction of Crassostrea mitochondrial genomes, and a lack of genetic structure in the ND4 gene among the three Texas bays as was found with Sanger amplicons in samples from the same bays several years prior. In the comparison between the Delaware and Texas genome, 27 of 38 coding regions exhibited variability between the two populations, which were differentiated by 273 mutations, versus 1-13 mutations among the Texas samples. Using the full PAGs, there was no additional evidence for population structure among the three Texas bays. While population genetics is rapidly moving towards larger high-density datasets, studies of mitochondrial DNA (and genomes) can be particularly useful for comparing historic data prior to the modern era of genomics. As such, being able to reliably compile mitochondrial genomes from genomic data can improve the ability to compare results across studies.","output":"Genetic diversity across the mitochondrial genome of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in the northern Gulf of Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The oleaginous microorganism Schizochytrium sp. is widely used in scientific research and commercial lipid production processes. However, low glucose-to-lipid conversion rate (GLCR) and low lipid productivity of Schizochytrium sp. restrict the feasibility of its use. RESULTS: Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor, which avoids triacylglycerols (TAGs) from hydrolysis by lipase. TAGs are the main storage forms of fatty acids in Schizochytrium sp. In this study, the usage of orlistat increased the GLCR by 21.88% in the middle stage of fermentation. Whereas the productivity of lipid increased 1.34 times reaching 0.73 g/L/h, the saturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid yield increased from 21.2 and 39.1 to 34.9 and 48.5 g/L, respectively, indicating the advantages of using a lipase inhibitor in microbial lipids fermentation. Similarly, the system was also successful in Thraustochytrid Aurantiochytrium. The metabolic regulatory mechanisms stimulated by orlistat in Schizochytrium sp. were further investigated using transcriptomics and metabolomics. The results showed that orlistat redistributed carbon allocation and enhanced the energy supply when inhibiting the TAGs degradation pathway. Therefore, lipase in Schizochytrium sp. prefers to hydrolyze saturated fatty acid TAGs into the -oxidation pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a simple and effective approach to improve lipid production, and makes us understand the mechanism of lipid accumulation and decomposition in Schizochytrium sp., offering new guidance for the exploitation of oleaginous microorganisms.

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalised patients that had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (HCQ/Az) or no targeted therapy. The primary end point was clinical improvement on day 7 defined as either hospital discharge or an improvement of two points on a six-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included mortality at day 28, intensive care (ICU) admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS Data from a total of 134 patients was evaluated, 82 patients received HCQ/Az and 52 patients received no targeted therapy. Clinical improvement was seen in 26.8% of patients who received HCQ/Az but this was not significant. The rates of ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation were higher in the treatment group, these differences were not significant. Mortality at day 28 was significantly higher in the treatment group (p 0.03). Hypoglycaemia elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and QT prolongation were monitored in both groups. The risk of QT prolongation was significantly higher in the treatment group. Treatment was stopped early in 6 (7.3%) patients due AEs.

Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafs, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Caf debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Caf for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

METHODS: We use a novel combination of a chronic and hidden hunger DALY estimation procedure and food system projections from quantitative foresight modeling to assess DALYs under alternative agricultural sector scenarios to midcentury. RESULTS: Total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs are projected to increase globally out to 2050by over 30 million compared with 2010even without climate change. Climate change increases total DALY change between 2010 and 2050 by nearly 10% compared with no climate change. Agricultural sector investments show promise for offsetting these impacts. With investments, DALY incidence due to chronic and hidden hunger is projected to decrease globally in 2050 by 0.24 and 0.56 per 1000 capita, respectively. Total global DALYs will still rise because projected population growth will outpace the rate reduction, especially in Africa south of the Sahara. However, projections also show important regional reductions in total DALYs due to chronic (13.9 million in South Asia, 4.3 million in East Asia and the Pacific) and hidden hunger (7.5 million in East Asia and the Pacific) with investments. CONCLUSIONS: Food system projections to 2050 show a decreasing DALY incidence from both chronic and hidden hunger. Population growth is projected to outpace these improvements and lead to increasing total chronic and hidden hunger DALYs globally, concentrated in Africa south of the Sahara. Climate change increases per-capita chronic and hidden hunger DALY incidence compared with no climate change.

Critically, successful adaptation helps to reduce such symptoms to baseline, preventing long-term psychiatric disorders. It is thus important to understand whether and which psychiatric symptoms show transient elevations, and which persist long-term and become chronically heightened. At particular risk for the latter trajectory are symptom dimensions directly affected by the pandemic, such as obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. In this longitudinal large-scale study (N = 406), we assessed how OC, anxiety and depression symptoms changed throughout the first pandemic wave in a sample of the general UK public. We further examined how these symptoms affected pandemic-related information seeking and adherence to governmental guidelines. We show that scores in all psychiatric domains were initially elevated, but showed distinct longitudinal change patterns. Depression scores decreased, and anxiety plateaued during the first pandemic wave, while OC symptoms further increased, even after the ease of Covid-19 restrictions. These OC symptoms were directly linked to Covid-related information seeking, which gave rise to higher adherence to government guidelines. This increase of OC symptoms in this non-clinical sample shows that the domain is disproportionately affected by the pandemic. We discuss the long-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on public mental health, which calls for continued close observation of symptom development.","output":"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and information seeking during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Artemisia is one of the most widely distributed genera of the family Astraceae with more than 500 diverse species growing mainly in the temperate zones of Europe, Asia and North America. The plant is used in Chinese and Ayurvedic systems of medicine for its antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, insecticidal, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties. Research based studies point to Artemisias role in addressing an entire gamut of physiological imbalances through a unique combination of pharmacological actions. Terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, caffeoylquinic acids, sterols and acetylenes are some of the major phytochemicals of the genus. Notable among the phytochemicals is artemisinin and its derivatives (ARTs) that represent a new class of recommended drugs due to the emergence of bacteria and parasites that are resistant to quinoline drugs. This manuscript aims to systematically review recent studies that have investigated artemisinin and its derivatives not only for their potent antiviral actions but also their utility against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Materials and Methods: PubMed Central, Scopus and Google scholar databases of published articles were collected and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. Conclusions: The unprecedented impact that artemisinin had on public health and drug discovery research led the Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 to the discoverers of artemisinin. Thus, it is clear that Artemisias importance in indigenous medicinal systems and drug discovery systems holds great potential for further investigation into its biological activities, especially its role in viral infection and inflammation.","output":"Antiviral and Immunomodulation Effects of Artemisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In modern bioinformatics, finding an efficient way to allocate sequence fragments with biological functions is an important issue.

However, the optimal number of cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy has not been determined. OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with advanced UC who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and investigate the association between the number of cycles of the treatment and the patients' overall survival. METHODS A total of 124 patients with advanced UC who were treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy at Osaka City University Hospital between April 2009 and January 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Of the 124 patients, clinical information regarding overall survival was available for 115 patients. The median age was 72 years (range, 43-95 years). Only 59 patients (51.3 %) were treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin, and 52 patients (45.2 %) were treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin. The median number of cycles was three (1-8), and the percentage of patients who discontinued chemotherapy due to progressive disease was 80.3%, 64.0%, and 86.4% in those receiving one to three, four, and five or more cycles, respectively. Moreover, no difference in overall survival was observed between patients who received four cycles and those who received five or more cycles at both univariate and multivariate levels.

Such methods are particularly called for in contexts where reliable data to a large extent are missing and where the chosen policy would impact a variety of sectors. In this paper, we present an application of an integrated decision-making framework under ambiguity on how to contain the COVID-19 virus spread from a national policy point of view. The framework was applied in Jordan and considered both local epidemiologic and socioeconomic estimates in a multistakeholder multicriteria context. In particular, the cocreation process for eliciting attitudes, perceptions, and preferences amongst relevant stakeholder groups has often been missing from policy response to the pandemic, even though the containment measuresefficiency largely depends on their acceptance by the impacted groups. For this, there exist several methods attempting to elicit criteria weights, values, and probabilities ranging from direct rating and point allocation methods to more elaborated ones. To facilitate the elicitation, some of the approaches utilise elicitation methods whereby prospects are ranked using ordinal importance information, while others use cardinal information. Methods are sometimes assessed in case studies or more formally by utilising systematic simulations. Furthermore, the treatment of corresponding methods for the handling of the alternatives values has sometimes been neglected. We demonstrate in our paper an approach for cardinal ranking in policy decision making in combination with imprecise or incomplete information concerning probabilities, weights, and consequences or alternative values.

The aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of the temporal course of the acute effects of furosemide in the inner ear, including the protein localization of Fetuin-A and PEDF in guinea pig cochleae. Material and Method: Adult guinea pigs were given an intravenous injection of furosemide in a dose of 100 mg per kg of body weight. The cochleae were studied using immunohistochemistry in controls and at four intervals: 3 min, 30 min, 60 min and 120 min. Also, cochleae of untreated guinea pigs were tested for Fetuin-A and PEDF mRNA using RNAscope? technology. Results: At 3 min, NKCC1 staining was abolished in the type II fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, followed by a recovery period of up to 120 min. In the stria vascularis, the lowest staining intensity of NKCC1 presented after 30 min. The spiral ganglion showed a stable staining intensity for the full 120 min. Fetuin-A protein and mRNA were detected in the spiral ganglion type I neurons, inner and outer hair cells, pillar cells, Deiters cells and the stria vascularis. Furosemide induced an increased staining intensity of Fetuin-A at 120 min. PEDF protein and mRNA were found in the spiral ganglia type I neurons, the stria vascularis, and in type I and type II fibrocytes of the spiral ligament.

ABSTRACT: Organ-like cell clusters, so-called organoids, which exhibit self-organized and similar organ functionality as the tissue of origin, have provided a whole new level of bioinspiration for ex vivo systems. Microfluidic organoid or organs-on-a-chip platforms are a new group of micro-engineered promising models that recapitulate 3D tissue structure and physiology and combines several advantages of current in vivo and in vitro models. Microfluidics technology is used in numerous applications since it allows us to control and manipulate fluid flows with a high degree of accuracy. This system is an emerging tool for understanding disease development and progression, especially for personalized therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment, which provide well-grounded, cost-effective, powerful, fast, and reproducible results. In this review, we highlight how the organoid-on-a-chip models have improved the potential of efficiency and reproducibility of organoid cultures. More widely, we discuss current challenges and development on organoid culture systems together with microfluidic approaches and their limitations. Finally, we describe the recent progress and potential utilization in the organs-on-a-chip practice.","output":"Microfluidic Organoids-on-a-Chip: Quantum Leap in Cancer Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely spread and caused tens of thousands of deaths, especially in patients with severe COVID-19. This analysis aimed to explore risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19, and establish a scoring system to predict in-hospital deaths. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed and clinical characteristics were compared. LASSO regression as well as multivariable analysis were used to screen variables and establish prediction model. FINDINGS: A total of 2529 patients with COVID-19 was retrospectively analyzed, and 452 eligible severe COVID-19 were used for finally analysis. In training cohort, the median age was 66?0 years while it was 73?0 years in non-survivors. Patients aged 60C75 years accounted for the largest proportion of infected populations and mortality toll. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were monitored up to 54 days, and IgG levels reached the highest during 20C30 days. No differences were observed of antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients. About 60.2% of severe patients had complications. Among acute myocardial injury (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute liver injury (ALI), the heart was the earliest injured organ, whereas the time from AKI to death was the shortest. Age, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), procalcitonin (PCT), serum urea, C reactive protein and D-dimer (), were identified associated with mortality by LASSO binary logistic regression. Then multivariable analysis was performed to conclude that old age, CHD, LYM%, PCT and  remained independent risk factors for mortality. Based on the above variables, a scoring system of COVID-19 (CSS) was established to divide patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. This model displayed good discrimination (AUC=0919) and calibration (P=0264). Complications in low-risk and high-risk groups were significantly different (P<005). Use of corticosteroids in low-risk groups increased hospital stays by 45 days (P=0036) and durations of disease by 75 days (P=0012) compared with no corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Old age, CHD, LYM%, PCT and  were independently related to mortality. CSS was useful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications, and it could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients with poor prognosis.

By performing comparative genome analysis of nidovirales that contain the family of coronaviruses, we traced the origin of proofreading, surprisingly to the eukaryotic antiviral component ZNFX1. This common recent ancestor contributes two zinc finger (ZnF) motifs that are unique to viral exonuclease, segregating them from DNA proof-readers. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that following acquisition, genomes of coronaviruses retained and further fine-tuned proofreading exonuclease, whereas related families harbor substitution of key residues in ZnF1 motif concomitant to a reduction in their genome sizes. Structural modelling followed by simulation suggests the role of ZnF in RNA binding. Key ZnF residues strongly coevolve with replicase, and the helicase involved in duplex RNA unwinding. Hence, fidelity of replication in coronaviruses is a result of convergent evolution, that enables maintenance of genome stability akin to cellular proofreading systems.","output":"Adaptive convergent evolution of genome proofreading in SARS-CoV2: insights into the Eigens paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microorganisms have long been suspected of causing Crohn's disease (CD); however, an etiologic agent has yet to be identified.

METHODS: A systematic review was used to identify papers from the National Library of Medicine, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Library, Defense Technical Information Center, WorldCat, and reference lists of included publications. Two authors reviewed selected papers for smallpox outbreaks. RESULTS: 51 relevant outbreaks were identified from 1,389 publications. The median for the effective first generation reproduction rate (initial R) was 2 (range 0C38). The majority outbreaks were small (less than 5 cases) and contained within one generation. Outbreaks with few hospitalized patients had low initial R values (median of 1) and were prolonged if not initially recognized (median of 3 generations); outbreaks with mostly hospitalized patients had higher initial R values (median 12) and were shorter (median of 3 generations). Index cases with an atypical presentation of smallpox were less likely to have been diagnosed with smallpox; outbreaks in which the index case was not correctly diagnosed were larger (median of 27.5 cases) and longer (median of 3 generations) compared to outbreaks in which the index case was correctly diagnosed (median of 3 cases and 1 generation). CONCLUSION: Patterns of spread during Smallpox outbreaks varied with circumstances, but early detection and implementation of control measures is a most important influence on the magnitude of outbreaks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative analysis of the treatment of 72 patients with allergic rhinitis, divided into groups: I (main, n=21), which included immunocompromised patients who received sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollin and inhaled immunotherapy with cycloferon (every other day, a course of 10 procedures, the total dose of Cycloferon per course is 1250 mg); II (comparison, n=22) - immunocompromised patients who received monotherapy with antipollinum and III (control, n=29) - patients with allergic rhinitis without signs of immunocompromise, who also received antipollinum. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the quality of life (RQLQ questionnaire), the severity of nasal symptoms (the patient's self-observation diary) and the need for drugs after a course of intranasal immunotherapy. RESULTS: The inclusion of cycloferon in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis increased its effectiveness - the severity of nasal symptoms decreased: in terms of sneezing, a decrease of 53.5 times versus 1.82 - in the control, ?nasal congestion? - 6.3 times versus 2.6 - in the control, ?itching in the nose? - 4.9 and 4.2 times, respectively (p<0.05).

The Indian government also issued an order for complete lockdown of the country, with all the nonessential services, including most of the services for nonemergency health issues, being temporarily suspended. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the effect of pandemic lockdown on medical advice-seeking behavior and the medication practices of the non-COVID Indian patients confined to homes, who would have normally visited the outpatient departments (OPDs) for medical advice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study conducted online during the lockdown period. The questions dealt with medical advice-related practices, self-medication, the sources of medical advice, and the need to visit emergency department. Evaluation of data was done as for descriptive studies. RESULTS: A total of 106 people (34%) out of the 312 participants had either old or new health problems. Ninety-six of such people (90.5%) tried to manage their sufferings by either continuing the drugs prescribed earlier or by making phone calls to doctors along with taking the help of home remedies, if needed. Ten (9.5%) of the symptomatic participants did not consult any doctor waiting for natural course of relief. None of the participants practiced self-medication of modern medicine therapy. Only one participant (of the total 312) took hydroxychloroquine as self-medication for assumed prophylactic therapy against the COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Most of the people with medical conditions, confined at home due to national lockdown, are coping with their problems without any irrational self-medication with modern medicines or any misuse of prophylactic therapy against the COVID infection.

This study was performed to evaluate viruses associated with croup in children, with an emphasis on HCoV-NL63. METHODS Nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from 182 children hospitalized with croup at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from January 2005 to June 2009. Multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was conducted for detection of 11 respiratory viruses, and medical records were reviewed. RESULTS Viruses were identified in 147 (80.8%) of the 182 croup patients. The 3 most commonly detected viruses were parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) in 44 (24.2%) patients, HCoV-NL63 in 30 (16.5%) patients, and influenza A virus in 25 (13.7%) patients. Other detected viruses were rhinovirus in 22 (12.1%) patients, PIV type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus in 15 (8.2%) patients, human bocavirus in 8 (4.4%) patients, and several others in a few patients.

However, most cases are mild to moderate in disease severity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine cognitive outcomes in cases of non-critical, mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 72 adults aged 22 to 65 years in Central Texas who had non-critical, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection between 13 January 2021 and 20 April 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We remotely administered cognitive-behavioral testing to determine the frequency of cognitive impairment and examine demographic, clinical, and psychosocial contributors to impairment. RESULTS: The frequency of objective cognitive impairment was 40%. The largest number of participants (24%) showed impairment on a measure of executive functioning. Attention and processing speed was more impaired in males (OR = 1.5, 95%CI = 0.23C2.9). Males endorsed lower adherence to social distancing guidelines (U = 590, p = 0.01), which was in turn associated with cognitive impairment across participants (r = ?0.30, p = 0.01). Younger age was correlated with impairment (r = ?0.26, p = 0.03) but was also associated with racial/ethnic minority status (r = ?0.31, p = 0.01) and increased psychological symptoms (p < 0.04). Greater number of COVID-19 symptoms was correlated with lower subjective cognitive function (r = ?0.38, p = 0.001) as well as psychosocial function (r > 0.24, p < 0.05). Moderate COVID-19 severity was associated with attention/processing speed impairment (r = 0.27, p = 0.03), increased pain (r = 0.31, p = 0.01), and higher number of COVID-19 symptoms (r = 0.32, p = 0.01).

Yet, considering the beneficial results reported for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, we used an MECC system in aortic valve replacement (AVR) and analysed the effects on intraoperative microvascular perfusion in comparison with conventional open extracorporeal circulation (CECC). METHODS In the current study, we analysed alterations in microvascular perfusion at 4 predefined time points (T1-T4) during surgical AVR utilizing orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging. Twenty patients were randomized for being operated on utilizing either MECC or CECC. Changes in functional capillary density (FCD, cm/cm(2)), mircovascular blood flow velocity (mm/s) and vessel diameter (m) were analysed by a blinded investigator. RESULTS After the start of extracorporeal circulation and aortic cross-clamping (T2), both groups showed a significant drop in FCD, but with a significantly higher FCD in the MECC group (153.1  15.0 cm/cm2 in the CECC group vs 160.8  12.2 cm/cm2 in the MECC group, P = 0.034). During the late phase of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (T3), the FCD was still significantly depressed in both treatment groups (153.5  14.6 cm/cm2 in the CECC group, P <0.05 vs 'T1'; 159.5  12.4 cm/cm2 in the MECC group, P <0.05 versus 'T1'). After termination of CPB (T4), the FCD recovered in both groups to baseline values. Microvascular blood flow velocity tended to remain at a higher level in the MECC group, whereas haemodilution during CPB was significantly reduced in the MECC group. CONCLUSIONS The use of MECC in AVR did not affect procedural safety and, resulted in beneficial preservation of microvascular blood flow velocity and significantly reduced haemodilution during CPB. In contrast to CABG surgery, the use of MECC did not improve FCD during surgical AVR.

The purpose was to assess the ability of DFA to detect syphilis during acute infection and to determine if non-serologic testing could yield an increased number of syphilis diagnoses. We reviewed charts of patients of our local sexual health clinic for whom syphilis was suspected. A total of 69 clinical encounters were recorded for 67 unique patients, most of whom were male. The most common symptom was a painless genital lesion. Of the 67 patients, 29 were found to have a new syphilis diagnosis, among whom, 52% had positive syphilis serology and positive DFA, 34% had a positive syphilis serology and negative DFA, and 14% had negative syphilis serology and positive DFA. While DFA testing did not yield an abundance of new cases, it was useful to support findings from syphilis serology or confirm diagnosis where serology was negative. Where available, alternate non-serologic tests, such as nucleic acid amplification tests, should be considered above DFA due to its higher sensitivity for detecting syphilis in primary lesions; however, in clinical situations, when new syphilis infection is suspected, empiric treatment should not be delayed.","output":"Direct fluorescence antibody testing augments syphilis diagnosis, compared to serology alone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to challenge the way the world has viewed and managed public health, everyday bringing new solutions and challenges.

There is an immediate need for a simple, rapid, early and sensitive point-of-care testing for COVID-19 disease. However, current testing approaches do not meet such need. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based detection methods have received substantial attention for nucleic acid-based molecular testing due to their simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity. This review explores the various CRISPR-based COVID-19 detection methods and related diagnostic devices. As with any emerging technology, CRISPR/Cas-based nucleic acid testing methods have several challenges that must be overcome for practical applications in clinics and hospitals. More importantly, these detection methods are not limited to COVID-19 but can be applied to detect any type of pathogen, virus, and fungi that may threaten humans, agriculture, and food industries in resource-limited settings. CRISPR/Cas-based detection methods have the potential to become simpler, more reliable, more affordable, and faster in the near future, which is highly important for achieving point-of-care diagnostics.","output":"CRISPR-Based COVID-19 Testing: Toward Next-Generation Point-of-Care Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common childhood muscular dystrophy.

The rapidly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants could increase the transmissibility, aggravate the severity, and even fade the vaccine protection. Although the coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory pathogens have been reported, whether multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants coinfection exists remains controversial. This study collected 12,986 and 4,113 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database on May 11, 2020 (GISAID20May11) and April 1, 2021 (GISAID21Apr1), respectively. With the single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and network clique analysis, we constructed the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coexistence networks and noted the SNP number of the maximal clique as the coinfection index. The coinfection indices of GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were 16 and 34, respectively. Simulating the transmission routes and the mutation accumulations, we discovered the linear relationship between the coinfection index and the coinfected variant number. Based on the linear relationship, we deduced that the COVID-19 cases in the GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets were coinfected with 2.20 and 3.42 SARS-CoV-2 variants on average. Additionally, we performed Nanopore sequencing on 42 COVID-19 patients to explore the virus mutational characteristics. We found the heterozygous SNPs in 41 COVID-19 cases, which support the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and challenge the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis. In conclusion, our findings reported the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in COVID-19 patients, demonstrated the increased coinfected variants number in the epidemic, and provided clues for the prolonged viral shedding and severe symptoms in some cases.","output":"Both Simulation and Sequencing Data Reveal Multiple SARS-CoV-2 Variants Coinfection in COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In an ideal world, everyone would receive medical resources in accordance with their needs. In reality, resources are often scarce and have an alternative use. Thus, we are forced to prioritize. Although Norway is one of the leading countries in normative priority setting work, few descriptive studies have been conducted in the country. To increase legitimacy in priority setting, knowledge about laypeoples attitudes is central. The aim of the study is therefore to assess the general populations attitudes towards a broad spectrum of issues pertinent to priority setting in the Norwegian publicly financed health care system. METHODS: We developed an electronic questionnaire that was distributed to a representative sample of 2 540 Norwegians regarding their attitudes towards priority setting in Norway. A total of 1 035 responded (response rate 40.7%). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A majority (73.0%) of respondents preferred increased funding of publicly financed health services at the expense of other sectors in society. Moreover, a larger share of the respondents suggested either increased taxes (37.0%) or drawing from the Government Pension Fund Global (31.0%) as sources of funding. However, the respondents were divided on whether it was acceptable to say no to new cancer drugs when the effect is low and the price is high: 38.6% somewhat or fully disagreed that this was acceptable, while 46.5% somewhat or fully agreed. Lastly, 84.0% of the respondents did not find it acceptable that the Norwegian municipalities have different standards for providing care services. CONCLUSION: Although the survey suggests support for priority setting among Norwegian laypeople, it has also revealed that a significant minority are reluctant to accept it.

Compared with the conventional technique, the \\"no-touch\\" technique, wherein the saphenous veins are harvested with the surrounding tissue, may improve SVG patency; however, there are concerns regarding wound complications. To address this issue, we describe our novel no-touch technique with separate skin incisions using a long-shafted ultrasonic scalpel and report the clinical outcomes. METHODS We enrolled 66 male patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between April 2016 and April 2021. There were 30 and 36 patients treated using our no-touch technique and the conventional technique, respectively. The participants underwent coronary angiography before discharge and were followed clinically. SVG samples were taken for pathological examination. RESULTS SVGs harvested using our no-touch technique displayed preservation of the vessel wall structure and surrounding tissues. Our no-touch technique demonstrated no inferiority in patency compared with the conventional technique, and there was no SVG occlusion in the no-touch group. The frequency of leg wound complications was higher in the no-touch group than the conventional group, but no surgical site infections and severe complications occurred in the no-touch group. CONCLUSIONS SVGs harvested using our novel no-touch technique had similar pathological characteristics to those harvested using the original no-touch technique reported previously. Our no-touch technique maintained SVG patency and caused no severe wound complications.

In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, an enhanced surveillance system of hospitalised COVID-19 patients was established by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System Coordinating Centre. The system aimed to reduce workforce capacity constraints and increase situational awareness on the status of hospitalised patients. Methods: The system was evaluated, using guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, against eight attributes: acceptability; data quality; flexibility; representativeness; simplicity; stability; timeliness; and usefulness. Evidence was generated from stakeholder consultation, participant observation, document review, systems review, issues log review and audits. Data were collected and analysed over a period of up to three months, covering pre- and post-implementation from March to June 2020. Results: This system was rapidly established by leveraging established relationships and infrastructure. Stakeholders agreed that the system was important but was limited by a reliance on daily manual labour (including weekends), which impeded scalability. The ability of the system to perform well in each attribute was expected to shift with the severity of the pandemic; however, at the time of this evaluation, when there were an average 23 new cases per day (0.3 cases per 100,000 population per day), the system performed well.

While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., \\"COVID toes\\", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries.

All adult patients with paramyxovirus were retrospectively reviewed over a 2-year period. Patients who received oral ribavirin were compared to those who received supportive care without ribavirin therapy. A propensity-matched case-control study and a logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to reduce the effect of selection bias in assignment for oral ribavirin therapy. A total of 145 patients, including 64 (44%) with PIV, 60 (41%) with RSV, and 21 (15%) with hMPV, were analyzed. Of these 145 patients, 114 (78%) received oral ribavirin and the remaining 31 (21%) constituted the nonribavirin group.

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients' perspectives on COVID-19 and understand the associated implications for treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of RCC patients was conducted from March 22 to March 25, 2020, disseminated through social media and patient networking platforms. The survey comprised 45 items, including baseline demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment-related information. Patients were additionally queried regarding their anxiety level related to COVID-19 and associated implications for their cancer diagnosis. INTERVENTION: An online survey study. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics with graphical outputs were used to characterize survey results. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 539 patients (male:female 39%:58%) from 14 countries responded. Of them, 71% felt that their risk of COVID-19 infection was higher than the general population, and 27% contacted their physician to establish this. Among patients with localized disease (40%), most (42%) had scheduled surveillance scans within 6 wk-65% were unwilling to delay scans. Among patients with metastatic disease, 76% were receiving active therapy. While most patients preferred not to defer therapy (51%), patients receiving immune therapy regimens were less amenable to deferring therapy than those receiving targeted treatment (20% vs 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high levels of anxiety surrounding COVID-19, many patients with RCC were inclined to adhere to existing schedules of surveillance (localized disease) and systemic treatment (metastatic disease).

Continuing to deliver time-critical surgical care is important to avoid excess morbidity and mortality from pathologies unrelated to COVID-19. We describe the implementation and short-term surgical outcomes from a system to deliver time-critical elective surgical care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A protocol for the prioritisation and safe delivery of time-critical surgery at a COVID-19 'clean' site was implemented at the Nuffield Health Exeter Hospital, an independent sector hospital in the southwest of England. Outcomes to 30 days postoperatively were recorded, including unplanned admissions after daycase surgery, readmissions and complications, as well as the incidence of perioperative COVID-19 infection in patients and staff. RESULTS A total of 128 surgical procedures were performed during a 31-day period by a range of specialties including breast, plastics, urology, gynaecology, vascular and cardiology. There was one unplanned admission and and two readmissions. Six complications were identified, and all were Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2. All 128 patients had preoperative COVID-19 swabs, one of which was positive and the patient had their surgery delayed. Ten patients were tested for COVID-19 postoperatively, with none testing positive. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated the implementation of a safe system for delivery of time-critical elective surgical care at a COVID-19 clean site. Other healthcare providers may benefit from implementation of similar methodology as hospitals plan to restart elective surgery.","output":"The provision of a time-critical elective surgical service during the COVID-19 Crisis: a UK experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to examine the predictive power of the daily newspaper-based index uncertainty related to infectious diseases (EMVID) for the US Treasury securities' realized volatility (RV) using the heterogonous autoregressive volatility (HAV-RV) model.

High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL/METHODS: Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS: The mean anxiety score was 44.288.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.","output":"Factors Influencing Anxiety of Health Care Workers in the Radiology Department with High Exposure Risk to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose and investigate a biosensor based on a transparent dielectric-modulated dual-trench gate-engineered metalCoxideCsemiconductor field-effect transistor (DM DT GE-MOSFET) for label-free detection of biomolecules with enhanced sensitivity and efficiency.

Models with nonconstant population have been studied in the past only in particular cases, two of which we review and combine. Our main result shows that for simple \\"matrix epidemic models\\" introduced in [1], an explicit general formula for the reproduction number and the corresponding \\"weak stability alternative\\" still holds, under small modifications, for models with nonconstant population size, and even when the model allows for vaccination and loss of immunity. The importance of this result is clear once we note that the models of [1] include a large number of viral and bacterial models of epidemic propagation, including for example the totality of homogeneous COVID-19 models. To better understand the nature of the result, we emphasize that the models proposed in [1] and considered here are extensions of the SIR-PH model, which is essentially characterized by a phase-type distribution that models transitions between the \\"disease/infectious compartments\\". In these cases, the reproduction number and a certain Lyapunov function for the disease free equilibrium are explicitly expressible. Not surprisingly, accounting for varying demography, loss of immunity, and vaccinations lead to several challenges. One of the most important is that a varying population size leads to multiple endemic equilibrium points: this is in contrast with \\"classic models\\" which in general admit unique disease-free and endemic equilibria. As a special case of our analysis, we consider a \\"first approximation\\" (FA) of our model, which coincides with the constant-demography model often studied in the literature, and for which more explicit results are available.

These drugs have been used in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated inflammatory sequelae or cytokine storm of infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the population-level interest in anti-rheumatic drugs during the COVID-19 era, by analyzing changes in Google search frequency data. METHOD: To obtain the relative search volume (RSV) of anti-rheumatic drugs, we queried Google Trends for 78 search terms representing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, antigout agents, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), immunosuppressants, biologics, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors within the USA. Three 8-week periods in 2020 (March 15-May 9), (May 10-July 4), and (July 5-August 29) representing the initial- and short-term periods were compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years (2017-2019). RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in RSV for colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab (and its brand name-Actemra), and anakinra, and statistically significant decreases among brand names of immunosuppressive agents (i.e., mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) during both the initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods as compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years. CONCLUSION: There were significant increases in RSV of colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and anakinra during both initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods when compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years reflecting a heightened level of information-seeking on these drugs during the pandemic.

In traditional optimizers in CNNs, the momentum is usually weighted by a constant. However, tuning hyperparameters for momentum can be computationally complex. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive momentum for fast and stable convergence. METHOD: Applying adaptive momentum rate proposes increasing or decreasing based on every epoch's error changes, and it eliminates the need for momentum hyperparameter optimization. We tested the proposed method with 3 different datasets: REMBRANDT Brain Cancer, NIH Chest X-ray, COVID-19 CT scan. We compared the performance of a novel adaptive momentum optimizer with Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and other adaptive optimizers such as Adam and RMSprop. RESULTS: Proposed method improves SGD performance by reducing classification error from 6.12 to 5.44%, and it achieved the lowest error and highest accuracy compared with other optimizers. To strengthen the outcomes of this study, we investigated the performance comparison for the state-of-the-art CNN architectures with adaptive momentum. The results shows that the proposed method achieved the highest with 95% compared to state-of-the-art CNN architectures while using the same dataset.

However, community health centers have played a critical role in addressing the COVID-19 testing needs of historically disadvantaged communities. The aim of this paper is to explore the perceptions of COVID-19 testing barriers in six Massachusetts communities that are predominantly low income and describe how these findings were used to build tailored clinical-community strategies to addressing testing inequities. METHODS: Between November 2020 and February 2021, we conducted 84 semi-structured qualitative interviews with 107 community health center staff, community partners, and residents. Resident interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Arabic. We used a 2-phase framework analysis to analyze the data, including deductive coding to facilitate rapid analysis for action and an in-depth thematic analysis applying the Social Ecological Model. RESULTS: Through the rapid needs assessment, we developed cross-site suggestions to improve testing implementation and communications, as well as community-specific recommendations (e.g., locations for mobile testing sites and local communication channels). Upstream barriers identified in the thematic analysis included accessibility of state-run testing sites, weak social safety nets, and lack of testing supplies and staffing that contributed to long wait times. These factors hindered residents' abilities to get tested, which was further exacerbated by individual fears surrounding the testing process and limited knowledge on testing availability. DISCUSSION: Our rapid, qualitative approach created the foundation for implementing strategies that reached underserved populations at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2021. We explored perceptions of testing barriers and created actionable summaries within 1C2 months of data collection. Partnering community health centers in Massachusetts were able to use these data to respond to the local needs of each community. This study underscores the substantial impact of upstream, structural disparities on the individual experience of COVID-19 and demonstrates the utility of shifting from a typical years' long research translation process to a rapid approach of using data for action.","output":"Addressing COVID-19 Testing Inequities Among Underserved Populations in Massachusetts: A Rapid Qualitative Exploration of Health Center Staff, Partner, and Resident Perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines short-term birth sequelae of the influenza pandemic of 1918C1920 in the United States using monthly data on births and all-cause deaths for 19 US states in conjunction with data on maternal deaths, stillbirths, and premature births.

Notable findings include: 1) a drop in births in the 3 months following peak mortality; 2) a reversion in births to normal levels occurring 5C7 months after peak mortality; and 3) a steep drop in births occurring 9C10 months after peak mortality. Interpreted in the context of parallel data showing elevated premature births, stillbirths, and maternal mortality during times of peak influenza mortality, these findings suggest that the main impacts of the 1918C1920 influenza on reproduction occurred through: 1) impaired conceptions, possibly due to effects on fertility and behavioral changes; 2) an increase in the preterm delivery rate during the peak of the pandemic; and 3) elevated maternal and fetal mortality, resulting in late-term losses in pregnancy.","output":"Short-Term Birth Sequelae of the 1918C1920 Influenza Pandemic in the United States: State-Level Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a new technique for rapid modeling and construction of scientifically accurate mesoscale biological models.

This article examines the intra-community dynamics and conflicts in Chinese San Franciscans' pursuit of education rights and racial equality in the 1980s and 1990s by reconstructing their various claims to education equality. These divergent yet analogous struggles for equal educational opportunities reflected varied racial attitudes and conceptions of Chinese American racial identity. What these disparate racial perceptions and identity conceptions embodied fundamentally was a range of arguments for racial inclusion and equality. The contrast and contradictions between these distinct views persisted, reemerging in Chinese Americans' continued apprehension of their racial identity in the wake of the renewed debate about racebased education policies that was juxtaposed with the rising racial hatred toward Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022 University of Illinois Press.

The United States has played a central role in coordinating responses to previous global health challenges, and its policy choices in the current pandemic will have a far-reaching impact on the rest of the world. Yet little is known about domestic support for international recovery efforts. We use a series of conjoint and persuasive messaging experiments, fielded on two national surveys of the U.S. adult population (N = 5,965), to study mass support for international redistribution. We find clear evidence that the general population strongly supports allocating vaccines to own-country recipients before others. Despite this vaccine nationalism, Americans are willing to support the government playing a major role in global pandemic recovery efforts, provided policymakers forge international agreements that ensure moderate domestic costs, burden-sharing with other countries, and priority for certain types of resources, such as domestically manufactured vaccines and patent buyouts. Finally, we test five different persuasive messaging strategies and find that emphasizing the relatively low costs and large economic benefits of global vaccination is the most promising means of increasing domestic support for international redistribution. Overall, our results demonstrate that policymakers can secure broad public support for costly international cooperation by crafting responses that are clearly aligned with U.S. economic interests.","output":"Building mass support for global pandemic recovery efforts in the United States (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2007, various urological procedures have been performed with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS surgery), including nephrectomy, pyeloplasty, simple prostatectomy and, with the refinement of laparoscopic instrumentation, radical prostatectomy.

The dangerousness of ECT has been mainly attributed to its claimed ability to cause brain damage. This narrative review aims to provide an update of the evidence with regard to whether the practice of ECT is associated with damage to the brain. An accepted definition of brain damage remains elusive. There are also ethical and technical problems in designing studies that look at this question specifically. Thus, even though there are newer technological tools and innovations, any review attempting to answer this question would have to take recourse to indirect methods. These include structural, functional, and metabolic neuroimaging; body fluid biochemical marker studies; and follow-up studies of cognitive impairment and incidence of dementia in people who have received ECT among others. The review of literature and present evidence suggests that ECT has a demonstrable impact on the structure and function of the brain.

DATA SOURCE A 2011-2019 versions of the American Community Survey developed by the University of Minnesota Integrated Public Use Microdata Series program. RESEARCH DESIGN We use difference-in-difference-in-differences (ie, triple difference) regressions to compare changes in the short-run impacts of local unemployment rates before and after the ACA. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Before the ACA, rises in local unemployment were associated with uninsurance due to losses in private coverage (ie, both nongroup and employer sponsored).Following the ACA's full implementation, the link between employment and coverage was attenuated by access to publicly subsidized qualified health plans on the ACA's nongroup market, and enhanced access to Medicaid in states that expanded. Our findings suggest protections from unemployment-linked uninsured spells are largest in states that expanded Medicaid. CONCLUSIONS Expanded access to coverage under the ACA could mitigate the adverse effects on insurance status and access to care historically linked to job loss. However, should the ACA be repealed, many households stand to lose their ability to turn to Medicaid or subsidized nongroup coverage as safety-net resources to offset the burdens of job loss.","output":"The Relationship Between Unemployment and Health Insurance Coverage: Before and After the Affordable Care Act's Coverage Expansions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Machine learning in computer-assisted diagnostics improves sensitivity of image analysis and reduces time and effort for interpretation. Compared to standard mammograms, a thermal scan is easily scalable and is a safer screening tool. We evaluate the performance of Thermalytix (an automated thermographic screening algorithm) compared with other standard breast cancer screening modalities. METHODS: A prospective multicentre study was conducted to assess the non-inferiority of sensitivity of Thermalytix (test device) to that of standard modalities in detecting malignancy in subjects who show possible symptoms of suspected breast cancer. Standard screening modalities and Thermalytix were obtained and interpreted independently in a blinded fashion. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to identify the best cut-off point, non-inferiority margin of 10% to demonstrate the non-inferiority. RESULTS: We recruited 258 symptomatic women who first underwent a thermal scan, followed by mammogram and/or ultrasound. At Youdens Index of ROC curve, the test device had a sensitivity of 82.5% (95% CI 73.2 to 91.9) and specificity of 80.5% (95% CI 75.0 to 86.1) as compared with diagnostic mammogram, which had sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 80.7 to 97.8) and specificity of 45.9% (95% CI 34.3 to 57.9) when BI-RADS 3 (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) was considered as test-positive. The overall area under the curve (AUC) was 0.845. For women aged <45 years, the test device had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0% (95% CI 66.4 to 97.2) and 80.6% (95% CI 72.9 to 86.9), respectively. For women aged 45 years, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.5% (95% CI 65.1 to 91.2) and 86.5% (95% CI 78.0 to 92.6, respectively). CONCLUSION: We evaluated Thermalytix, a new AI-based modality for detecting breast cancer. The high AUC in both women under 45 years and above 45 years shows the potential of Thermalytix to be a supplemental diagnostic modality for all ages.

This has created a challenge of unimaginable magnitude, not only affecting human health and life but also potentially generating a long-lasting socioeconomic impact. Both medical sciences and biomedical research have also been challenged, consequently leading to a large number of clinical trials and vaccine initiatives. While known proteins of pathobiological importance are targets for these therapeutic approaches, it is imperative to explore other factors of viral significance. Accessory proteins are one such trait that have diverse roles in coronavirus pathobiology. Here, we analyze certain genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF8 and predict its protein features. We have further reviewed current available literature regarding its function and comparatively evaluated these and other features of ORF8 and ORF8ab, its homolog from SARS-CoV. Because coronaviruses have been infecting humans repeatedly and might continue to do so, we therefore expect this study to aid in the development of holistic understanding of these proteins. Despite low nucleotide and protein identity and differentiating genome level characteristics, there appears to be significant structural integrity and functional proximity between these proteins pointing towards their high significance. There is further need for comprehensive genomics and structural-functional studies to lead towards definitive conclusions regarding their criticality and that can eventually define their relevance to therapeutics development.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and SARS-CoV ORF8ab: Genomic Divergence and Functional Convergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of crises, culminating with COVID-19, shows that going Beyond GDP is urgently necessary.

Specifically, neo-humanism suggests that prioritizing well-being by, for instance, promoting social relations, would benefit the environment, enable collective action to address public issues, which in turn positively affects productivity and health, among other behavioral outcomes, and thereby instills a virtuous cycle. Arguably, such a society would have been better endowed to cope with COVID-19, and possibly even prevented the pandemic.

CoVs primarily infect lung and gut epithelial cells, besides monocytes and macrophages. CoVs have high mutation rates causing changes in host specificity, tissue tropism, and mode of virus excretion and transmissions. The recent CoV zoonoses are SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 that are caused by the transmission of beta-CoVs of bats to humans. Recently, reverse zoonoses of the COVID-19 virus have been detected in dogs, tigers, and minks. Beta-CoV strains also infect bovine (BCoV) and canine species (CRCoV);both these beta-CoVs might have originated from a common ancestor. Despite the high genetic similarity between BCoV, CRCoV, and HCoV-OC43, these differ in species specificity. Alpha-CoV strains infect canine (CCoV), feline (FIPV), swine (TGEV and PEDV), and humans (HCoV229E and NL63). Six coronavirus species are known to infect and cause disease in pigs, seven in human beings, and two in dogs. The high mutation rate in CoVs is attributed to error-prone 3-5 exoribonuclease (NSP 14), and genetic recombination to template shift by the polymerase.

We describe a dynamic response to exposures of HCWs at the Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, to minimize the need for suspension from work. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological investigation following each exposure to a newly diagnosed COVID-19 patient or HCW; close contacts were suspended from work. During the course of the epidemic, we adjusted our isolation criteria according to the timing of exposure related to symptoms onset, use of personal protective equipment and duration of exposure. In parallel, we introduced universal masking and performed periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening for all hospital personnel. We analyzed the number of HCWs suspended weekly from work and those who subsequently acquired infection. RESULTS: In the 51 investigations conducted during March-May 2020, we interviewed 1095 HCWs and suspended 400 (37%) from work, most of them, 251 (63%), during the first two weeks of the outbreak. The median duration of exposure was 30 minutes (IQR, 15-120). Only 5/400 (1.3%) developed infection, all in the first two weeks of the epidemic. After introduction of universal masking and despite loosening the isolation criteria, none of the exposed HCWs developed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively short exposures of HCWs, even if only either the worker or the patient wore a mask, probably poses a very low risk for infection. This allows us to perform strict follow-up of exposed HCWs in these exposures, combined with repeated testing, instead of suspension from work.","output":"A dynamic response to exposures of healthcare workers to newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients or hospital personnel, in order to minimize cross transmission and need for suspension from work during the outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a wide number of compounds are under scrutiny regarding their antiviral activity, one of them being hydroxychloroquine Cardiac aspects of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are reviewed in this manuscript A non-systematic review of the medical literature was performed Information about their safety and efficacy as antimalarials, antivirals, as well as in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases was collected We found an anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of longterm cardiovascular events, a very infrequent heart disease due to a lysosomal effect of the drug, and at the hemodynamic level hypotension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation, exacerbated when combined with azithromycin However, the rate of adverse cardiac events of hydroxychloroquine (and chloroquine) was low","output":"[Hydroxychloroquine.

The presence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus can potentially impact therapeutic and diagnostic test performances. We design and develop here a unique set of DNA probes i.e., antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) which can interact with genetic sequences of the virus irrespective of its ongoing mutations. The probes, developed herein, target a specific segment of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 with high binding efficiency which do not mutate among the known variants. Further probing into the interaction profile of the ASOs reveals that the ASO-RNA hybridization remains unaltered even for a hypothetical single point mutation at the target RNA site and diminished only in case of the hypothetical double or triple point mutations. The mechanism of interaction among the ASOs and SARS-CoV-2 RNA is then explored with a combination of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and machine learning techniques.

Fertility control is designed to create a level of population growth appropriate to the resources available and to ensure a good life. Receiving information and education is one of the basic strategies to change the attitude toward fertility and awareness in most people in society. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of education on knowledge of fertility counseling and attitudes toward fertility control in health workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was a randomized clinical trial with a control group that was conducted in the presence of 107 health workers of health centers and community health centers working in Mashhad in 2017. The research units were randomly divided into three groups (webinar training, group discussion training, and control). Research tools were researcher-made questionnaires on attitudes toward fertility and measuring healthy reproductive awareness that all study participants completed at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks after the intervention. Data analysis was performed by the Chi-square, one-way analysis of variance, and independent t-test using the SPSS software version 16. RESULTS The results of this study showed that at the beginning of the study, all three groups were homogeneous in terms of quantitative and qualitative demographic variables including age, education, work experience, type of employment, and number of family members. The results of Kruskal-Wallis test showed that before the intervention, the three groups did not have a statistically significant difference in terms of mean scores of awareness about fertility counseling (P = 0.77) and attitude toward fertility control (P = 0.523), but this relationship was significant after the interventions. Furthermore, the results of Mann-Whitney intragroup test showed that the scores before and after the intervention were significant in both educational groups (P = 0.001).

However, no studies comprehensively investigated their mental status. Thus, this study investigated the prevalence, comparisons and risk factors of mental problems among three groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 1300 participants including 137 PCs, 159 HCWs and 1003 GP were enrolled. The anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) were assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Findings: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSS were 21.7%, 76.1% and 19.5% in PCs, 9.3%, 25.3% and 9.5% in HCWs, and 12.7%, 25.8% and 6.9% in GP, respectively. The SAS, SDS and PCL-C total scores differed among three groups after controlling for covariates (all, p<0.01). The SAS, SDS and PCL-C total scores were significantly higher in PCs than HCWs and GP (all, p<0.01). Moreover, the distribution of age grouped differed between HCWs with and without depression (p<0.05). The frequency of having friend or relative infected was higher in PCs with than without PTSS as well as the higher married frequency in GP with than without PTSS (both, p<0.01).

When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. DESIGN: This retrospective chart review, followed by a descriptive survey design study, was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24  16.99 yrs were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared with the preinfectious and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and limbs during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain.

Circulating through Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, dystopian photos and videos of abandoned streets, plazas, and malls resonated with harrowing scenes of attacking hordes of zombies in the Netflix series Kingdeom (2019-2020), whose second season premiered when most Southeast Asian cities experienced lockdowns. Global news agencies reported on the unsettling anxiety about contagion from foreign migrants and tourists, from which, despite intensifying social tensions, many developing or emerging economies in Southeast Asia derive their vitality. If the scholarship about zombie narratives tends to focus on the docile, subjugated bodies of mass labour, critiques of neoliberal capitalism highlight their insatiable, irrational consumerism. In contrast, this article explores how the steep downturns from travel restrictions and citywide lockdowns to fight the outbreak have exposed the dependency of developmental state capitalism for its rapid pace of material growth not only on the flexibility of migrant labour but also on the contingency of speculative investment from overseas. Whereas state capitalism is typically understood to deploy its resources in protected industries and state-owned enterprises to consolidate its political rule, its use of authority now appears to centre on reducing market risk. The resilient temporality of the novel coronavirus has led to a new cyclical capitalist normalcy of surging, declining, and resurging infections, which governments have struggled to manage through varied forms of lockdown and quarantine such as Circuit Breakers (CB) in Singapore, Movement Control Orders (MCO) in Kuala Lumpur, and Enhanced Community Quarantines (ECQ) in Manila, with the failed aspiration of economic stability.","output":"Zombie capitalism and coronavirus time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the applicability of contingent behavior (hereafter, CB) method for analyzing dynamic processes and efficient policies in tourism demand recovery.

After the lockdown, the French strategy to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 relied partly on investigations of all confirmed cases. Monitoring collective settings is particularly important since SARS-CoV-2 seems prone to superspreading events (SSEs). Methods Our study is based on data gathered in Paris from May 11 to December 31, 2020, by the Ile-de-France Regional Health Agency (RHA) to investigate cases occurring in collective and high-risk settings. Specific events in high-risk settings were systematically transmitted to the RHA, and screenings were organized by the facilities, while other settings were reported when three cases were identified within a short period. These settings were more difficult to identify through the surveillance system since no systematic screening was organized by the facility, leaving screenings to rely on the national contact-tracing programme. No official superspreading threshold has been set for SARS-CoV-2. We defined a SSE as an event involving ten cases. Results We analysed 15,706 events associated with 38,670 cases, representing an average of 2.70 cases per event. Most clusters occurred in educational facilities, workplace environments, social care settings, and healthcare facilities. SSEs represented 3.4% but accounted for 28% of all cases reported. The highest number of SSEs occurred in college settings (12.6%), followed by hospitals and retirement homes. Educational facilities had the lowest number of SSEs, with around 1% in preschools and elementary schools. Conclusions We observed different SSE rates in each setting. Preschools and primary schools represented the majority of events but experiencing very few SSEs. Colleges were prone to SSEs and were associated with a high number of secondary cases. These findings provide some insights on contact tracing activities and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different settings.","output":"Superspreading events of SARS-CoV-2 in Paris: A retrospective analysis of data from the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombophilia, as well as multiple organ dysfunction, are typical manifestations of the severe new coronavirus infection that closely resemble the clinical signs of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) The objective: to assess whether catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is an essential manifestation of severe forms of COVID-19 Subjects and methods 45 patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2) and a severe course of viral pneumonia (more than 3 points on the NEWS score by the admission, CT 3-4, oxygenation index below 100, the need for at least high-flow oxygen therapy) They were assessed for the development of CAPS due to signs of progressing organ dysfunction despite the ongoing intensive therapy, suspected pulmonary embolism and progressing venous thrombosis of a lower extremity or subclavian vein It was an essential provision that they should have no signs of bacterial infection (blood procalcitonin should be below 0 5 g/l) The antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed based on the detection of antibodies to -2-glycoprotein in the blood (A/t -2-GP1 IgGAM, A/t -2-GP1 IgM, A/t -2-GP1 IgG) and to cardiolipin (A/t CL IgM, A/t CL IgG) by ELISA tests The course of the disease was monitored using other routine clinical (temperature, complete blood and urine counts) tests and blood panel tests reflecting the severity of the systemic inflammatory response (ferritin, CRP, interleukins 6 and 18), and the state of the hemostatic, respiratory, circulatory, liver and kidney systems Results Antiphospholipid antibodies (aAPL) moderately exceeding the reference values were detected in 9 out of 45 patients (20%), mainly due to IgA and IgM isotypes to -2-glycoprotein and IgM isotype to cardiolipin The assessment of the antibody titer in 5 patients over time (after 7 days) revealed a decrease, but it did not affect the outcome (four of them died) In 36 patients, some traces of aAPL were found that did not reach the lower limit of the norm, despite the uniformity of the clinical signs and similarity of biochemical parameters reflecting the severity of organ disorders The absence of antibodies did not prevent the development of thrombotic complications (thrombosis of large vessels and pulmonary embolism in 5 patients) There were no other manifestations often associated with CAPS (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, decreased fibrinogen concentration in the blood) Conclusion Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome is not inevitable in severe COVID-19 cases, however, it can develop as one of the manifestations of thrombophilia that occurs in such patients ? 2021 New Terra Publishing House All rights reserved","output":"Catastrophic antiphospholipid COVID-19 syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic requires motivating the vast majority of Americans to get vaccinated.

These effects were statistically mediated by participants reports of how much they thought Republican politicians would want them to get vaccinated. We also found evidence of backlash effects against Democratic elites: Republicans who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement reported they would be significantly less likely to encourage others to vaccinate and had more negative attitudes towards the vaccine, compared with those who viewed the Republican elite endorsement or the neutral control.

On the other hand, hospital employees suffer significant gaps in emergency preparedness knowledge and skills when it comes to treating mass casualties. The objective of this study was to assess the nurses and physicians familiarity with emergency preparedness and identify the associated factors. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by census utilizing a self-administered questionnaire among all nurses and physicians working in emergency departments in East Gojjam zone public hospitals. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS 25.0 for further analysis. Frequency, mean, and standard deviation were computed to describe individual and other characteristics of the sample. A simple and multiple linear regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with familiarity with emergency preparedness. An unstandardized adjusted beta () coefficient with a 95 % confidence level was used to report the result of the association at a p-value of 0.05 statistical significance.

Responding to this, we assessed barriers to TB case finding from the perspective, experiences and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in rural and urban health facilities in the Volta region, Ghana. METHODS: We conducted structured clinic observations and in-depth interviews with 12 HCWs (including five trained in TB case detection) in four rural health facilities and a municipal hospital. Interview transcripts and clinic observation data were manually organised, triangulated and analysed into health system-related and HCW-related barriers. RESULTS: The key health system barriers identified included lack of TB diagnostic laboratories in rural health facilities and no standard referral system to the municipal hospital for further assessment and TB testing. In addition, missed opportunities for early diagnosis of TB were driven by suboptimal screening practices of HCWs whose application of the national standard operating procedures (SOP) for TB case detection was inconsistent. Further, infection prevention and control measures in health facilities were not implemented as recommended by the SOP. HCW-related barriers were mainly lack of training on case detection guidelines, fear of infection (exacerbated by lack of appropriate personal protective equipment [PPE]) and lack of motivation among HCWs for TB work. Solutions to these barriers suggested by HCWs included provision of at least one diagnostic facility in each sub-municipality, provision of transport subsidies to enable patients travel for testing, training of newly-recruited staff on case detection guidelines, and provision of appropriate PPE. CONCLUSION: TB case finding was undermined by few diagnostic facilities; inconsistent referral mechanisms; poor implementation, training and quality control of a screening tool and guidelines; and HCWs fearing infection and not being motivated. We recommend training for and quality monitoring of TB diagnosis and treatment with a focus on patient-centred care, an effective sputum transport system, provision of the TB symptom screening tool and consistent referral pathways from peripheral health facilities.

A refined classification based on evaluation the limitations of intrinsic capacity, environment and social interaction, could provide a basis to predict the future disability and identify individuals with increased risk of adverse outcomes. METHODS: A new functional classification among older adults aged 60 and over was conducted by latent class analysis and compared with the traditional classifications, based on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. To further investigate the scientific validity of this new classification, associations with 7-year mortality and ADLs impairments among categories were tested by using Survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models. This was followed by the confirmatory analysis related to the prospective data. Competing risk analysis was also performed to analysis the sensitivity to further support our conclusions. RESULTS: Five categories were identified among 5,992 older adults which gave the best fitting, yielding a significant Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (p < 0.001) and Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (p < 0.001), with an entropy over 0.80. The presence of five categories: health (34.0%), sub-disorder status (36.6%), acute diseases (10.3%), somatic functional disorder (7.7%), and viability disorder (11.4%), which matched well with the functional independence rates by the international classifications. Among them, those in sub-disorder status were considered as an intermediate status between disability and health. The findings also revealed that those who were in acute disease, somatic functional disorders, health and sub-disorder status had a significant lower risk of mortality and ADLs limitations than viability disorder. And the risks gradually increased towards the less functionally independent end of the classification. However, the distribution of characteristics among five categories were in a synchronous change, indicating a stable classification. CONCLUSIONS: A new classification representing the functional heterogeneity of older adults could effectively stratify the risk of mortality and ADLs limitations. Identifying the clusters of functional decline might be useful in predicting subsequent ageing trends, designing personalized intervention, and delaying the progression of disability and preventing its occurrence.

Inflammation activates platelets. Since treatment of inflammatory arthritis is associated with reduced mortality, and decreased platelet reactivity reduces cardiovascular events, we hypothesised that platelet reactivity as measured by dynamic platelet function (DPF) would be increased in patients with inflammatory arthritis and that reactivity could be reduced with therapeutic intervention. OBJECTIVES: To characterise platelet function using a validated physiological assay in patients with inflammatory arthritis before and after disease improvement. METHODS: 22 patients were recruited and treated as per local protocol. DPF was measured at baseline and after clinical improvement. Video microscopy was utilised to measure dynamic platelet behaviour in microliters of blood perfused over von Willebrand factor (VWF) at arterial shear rates (1500 s-1). Motion-analysis software measured the number of platelets interacting with VWF, translocating across VWF, the speed and distance platelets travelled across VWF, and stably adhering to the surface. Platelet parameters at baseline and following improvement were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired student t-test. Changes in platelet function were correlated to inflammatory disease markers by Pearson Correlation. RESULTS: 18 patients completed the study. Platelet adhesion decreased and platelet motion increased following treatment. Tender joint count correlated with platelet adhesion (Pearson r = 0.616, p0.01) while CRP correlated with velocity of platelet movement (Pearson r = 0.563, p0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in clinical markers of inflammation is associated with a corresponding change in platelet function.

Here, a panel of reporter strains of Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli was developed to provide live biosensors for precise monitoring of antimicrobial activity. We optimized cell morphology, fluorescent protein, and selected the most efficient promoters for stable, homogeneous, high-level production of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in E. coli. Two alternative strategies based on highly efficient constitutive promoter pJ23119 or T7 promoter leakage enabled sensitive fluorescent detection of bacterial growth and killing. The developed live biosensors were applied for isolating potent E. coli-killing Paenibacillus polymyxa P4 strain by the ultrahigh-throughput screening of soil microbiome. The multi-omics approach revealed antibiotic colistin (polymyxin E) and its biosynthetic gene cluster, mediating antibiotic activity. Live biosensors may be efficiently implemented for antibiotic/probiotic discovery, environmental monitoring, and synthetic biology.","output":"Live Biosensors for Ultrahigh-Throughput Screening of Antimicrobial Activity against Gram-Negative Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything by George Bernard Shaw.

We used data from a randomized controlled trial of 87 participants with PTSD aged 14-21 years. The discriminative ability was evaluated by comparing participants scores on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L with general population scores. Furthermore, the discriminative ability between subgroups of participants with different disease severity levels was estimated. Correlations between the EQ-5D index and clinical parameters were used to measure construct validity. Test-retest reliability was measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between baseline, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up scores of participants with stable symptoms. Finally, the responsiveness of the EQ-5D was calculated by mean differences, effect sizes and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for participants with improved symptoms. Participants reported significantly more problems on the dimensions \\"mobility\\", \\"usual activities\\", \\"pain/discomfort\\" and \\"anxiety/depression\\" than the general population. The EQ-5D-5L was able to discriminate between different disease severity levels. The EQ-5D index and clinical scales were significantly correlated with absolute values of correlation coefficients varying between 0.21 and 0.59. Furthermore, ICCs between 0.65 and 0.91 indicated good test-retest reliability for the EQ-5D index. The ICCs for the EQ-VAS between baseline and 3-month follow-up, and posttreatment and 3-month follow-up were statistically significant with 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, whereas the ICC between baseline and posttreatment was 0.08 and not statistically significant. Effect sizes to measure the responsiveness ranged between -0.008 and 0.40 for the EQ-5D index and - 0.32 and 0.40 for the EQ-VAS. Furthermore, the area under the curve in ROC analyses was between 0.40 and 0.64 for the EQ-5D index and 0.60 and 0.70 for the EQ-VAS.

In 2008, a total of 36,450 drug overdose deaths (i.e., unintentional, intentional [suicide or homicide], or undetermined intent) were reported, with prescription opioid analgesics (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone), cocaine, and heroin the drugs most commonly involved . Since the mid-1990s, community-based programs have offered opioid overdose prevention services to persons who use drugs, their families and friends, and service providers. Since 1996, an increasing number of these programs have provided the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, the treatment of choice to reverse the potentially fatal respiratory depression caused by overdose of heroin and other opioids. Naloxone has no effect on non-opioid overdoses (e.g., cocaine, benzodiazepines, or alcohol) . In October 2010, the Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy and capacity-building organization, surveyed 50 programs known to distribute naloxone in the United States, to collect data on local program locations, naloxone distribution, and overdose reversals. This report summarizes the findings for the 48 programs that completed the survey and the 188 local programs represented by the responses. Since the first opioid overdose prevention program began distributing naloxone in 1996, the respondent programs reported training and distributing naloxone to 53,032 persons and receiving reports of 10,171 overdose reversals.

The structural analyses of these variants reveal a high population of more unstable beta-domain and distorted hydrophobic core compared to the wild-type human lysozyme, particularly for the two natural amyloidogenic variants D67H and I56T. For the D67H variant, the distance between the mass centers of residues 54 and 67 was found to elongate as a result of the destruction of the hydrogen-bonding network stabilizing the two long loops in the beta-domain. It further accelerates the unfolding of this variant, starting from the hydrophobic core between the alpha- and beta-domains. For the I56T variant, the introduction of a hydrophilic residue in the hydrophobic core directly destroys the native contacts in the alpha-beta interface, leading to fast unfolding.

Reducing inequalities is particularly pertinent in light of the Covid-19 outbreak which has exacerbated already widening inequalities in health. This study aimed to explore understandings of inequality, the anticipated pathways for reducing inequalities among CYP and key factors affecting the development and implementation of policy to reduce inequalities among CYP at a local level. METHODS: We carried out a qualitative case study of one local government region in the North of England (UK), comprising semi structured interviews (n = 16) with service providers with a responsibility for child health, non-participant observations of key meetings (n = 6 with 43 participants) where decisions around child health are made, and a local policy documentation review (n = 11). We employed a novel theoretical framework, drawing together different approaches to understanding policy, to guide our design and analysis. RESULTS: Participants in our study understood inequalities in CYP health almost exclusively as socioeconomically patterned inequalities in health practices and outcomes. Strategies which participants perceived to reduce inequalities included: preventive support and early intervention, an early years/whole family focus, targeted working in local areas of high deprivation, organisational integration and whole system/place-based approaches. Despite demonstrating a commitment to a social determinants of health approach, efforts to reduce inequalities were described as thwarted by the prevalence of poverty and budget cuts which hindered the ability of local organisations to work together. Participants critiqued national policy which aimed to reduce inequalities in CYP health for failing to recognise local economic disparities and the interrelated nature of the determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased calls for a 'whole systems' approach to reducing inequalities in health, significant barriers to implementation remain. National governments need to work towards more joined up policy making, which takes into consideration regional disparities, allows for flexibility in interpretation and addresses the different and interrelated social determinants of health. Our findings have particular significance in light of Covid-19 and indicate the need for systems level policy responses and a health in all policies approach.","output":"Exploring the local policy context for reducing health inequalities in children and young people: an in depth qualitative case study of one local authority in the North of England, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 36 papers.

Here we tested Remdesivir-TP as a substrate for a panel of human hydrolases and found that NUDIX hydrolase 18 (NUDT18) catalyzes the hydrolysis of Remdesivir-TP. NUDT18 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells suggesting that NUDT18 may limit the antiviral efficacy of Remdesivir by decreasing the intracellular concentration of its active metabolite at its intended site of action. The kcat of NUDT18 for Remdesivir-TP was determined to 2.6 s-1 and the Km value was 156 M, suggesting that NUDT18 catalyzed hydrolysis occurs in cells. In addition, we found that the triphosphate of the antiviral Ribavirin, with broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, was hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit with a lower efficiency compared to Remdesivir-TP. NUDT18 activity was also tested with the triphosphates of the antivirals Sofosbuvir and Aciclovir for which low activity, in comparison to activities with Remdesivir-TP and Ribavirin-TP, was detected.

Results: A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan , Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 9998% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness.

Although vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare, how the placenta defends against SARS-CoV-2, and whether there is a sex bias in the risk of vertical transmission, is not well understood. We sought to investigate whether placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression vary by fetal sex in the presence of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study Design: This is a cohort study of 66 pregnant women (37 SARS-CoV-2 exposed, 29 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed) enrolled on admission to Massachusetts General Hospital from April-June 2020, coincident with universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 exposure status was determined by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Groups were balanced for fetal sex and maternal disease severity. RNA was isolated from placental homogenates and RTqPCR was performed to quantify expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 relative to the reference gene YWHAZ, using the 2-(DELTADELTACt) method. The impact of fetal sex and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. Previously determined placental viral loads showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any placentas. Result(s): While there were no fetal sex or SARS-CoV-2 exposure-mediated differences in ACE2 expression (1A), we observed 1.73-fold increased TMPRSS2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 exposed placentas of female offspring compared to female controls (P=0.04, 1B), and 1.84 -fold reduced TMPRSS2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 exposed placentas of male offspring compared to male controls (P=0.0003, 1B). TMPRSS2 expression was significantly higher in placentas of male compared to female offspring in controls (P<0.0001). Conclusion(s): Sexually dimorphic patterns of TMPRSS2 placental gene expression were observed in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, driven by sex differences in TMPRSS2 expression in controls.

This approach reveals that the OE of patients with persistent smell loss harbors a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-gamma; gene expression in sustentacular cells appears to reflect a response to inflammatory signaling, which is accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to support cells. These data identify a persistent epithelial inflammatory process associated with PASC, and suggests mechanisms through which this T cell-mediated inflammation alters the sense of smell.","output":"Persistent post-COVID-19 smell loss is associated with inflammatory infiltration and altered olfactory epithelial gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a CASE of minimal change disease (MCD) with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) following the first injection of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca).

Refractory hyperkalemia and hypervolemia with oligoanuria prompted initiation of hemodialysis. His serum albumin was 2.6 g/dL and his urinary protein-creatinine ratio was 2321 mg/mmol. Given a high suspicion for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, empirical glucocorticoid treatment was initiated (3 methylprednisolone pulses followed by high-dose prednisone). A kidney biopsy showed minimal change disease (MCD) and acute tubular injury. Kidney function and proteinuria subsequently improved, and hemodialysis was discontinued 38 days after the start of therapy. This case describes de novo MCD after the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It adds to the few published case reports of MCD after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effects of extracts of peel and seed of mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivated in Sicily (Italy) in 3T3-L1 cells. Mango Peel (MPE) and Mango Seed (MSE) extracts at a 100 g/mL concentration significantly reduced lipid accumulation and triacylglycerol contents during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation without toxicity. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed that both the extracts contain some polyphenolic compounds that can account for the observed biological effects. The anti-adipogenic effect of MPE and MSE was the result of down-regulation of the key adipogenic transcription factor PPAR and its downstream targets FABP4/aP2, GLUT4 and Adipsin, as well SREBP-1c, a transcription factor which promotes lipogenesis. In addition, both MPE and MSE significantly activated AMPK with the consequent inhibition of Acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) and up-regulated PPAR. The addition of compound C, a specific AMPK inhibitor, reduced the effects of MPE and MSE on AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, suggesting a role of AMPK in mediating MPE and MSE anti-lipogenic effects. Notably, MPE and MSE possess an elevated radical scavenging activity, as demonstrated by DPPH radical scavenging assay, and reduced ROS content produced during adipocyte differentiation. This last effect could be a consequence of the increase in the antioxidant factors Nrf2, MnSOD and HO-1. In conclusion, MPE and MSE possesses both anti-adipogenic and antioxidant potential, thus suggesting that the bio-waste products of mango are promising anti-obesity natural compounds.","output":"Bio-Waste Products of Mangifera indica L.

The main control measures are physical distancing, use of specific protective devices, hand hygiene and disinfection of environments and tools. During this health emergency, telemedicine and telerehabilitation guaranteed patients to receive continuity of care through a virtual support while maintaining physical distance. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of telerehabilitation on gross motor skills in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) during Covid-19 lockdown. DESIGN: observational study. SETTING: Pediatric Outpatient Neurorehabilitation Service. POPULATION: 53 children with Cerebral Palsy aged between 6 months and 12 years classified according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). METHODS: variation on the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) score calculated before and after the telerehabilitation period was analyzed. RESULTS: after telerehabilitation there was a statistically significant increase in the median value of GMFM scores both on the total sample (from 54.82% to 63.18%, p-value 0.000005) and in the subgroups. Specifically, in children classified as level I and II at the GMFCS, this value increased more after the telerehabilitation period. Only the GMFCS level V group did not show statistically significant changes and only in two cases a decrease in the GMFM score after the telerehabilitation phase occurred. CONCLUSIONS: telerehabilitation can be considered an efficient tool that can temporarily replace the in person therapy. It can allow the patient or caregiver to acquire skills in performing home exercises and to integrate and implement activity carried out at the rehabilitation center.

This study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios. Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard or a powered respirator. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. In the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility. All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events. Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq&#8482;; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively. Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used. Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group. We conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.","output":"The impact of respiratory protective equipment on difficult airway management: a randomised, crossover, simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This survey study examines knowledge, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions among survey respondents exposed to different types of COVID-19 prevalence maps.","output":"Exposure to Common Geographic COVID-19 Prevalence Maps and Public Knowledge, Risk Perceptions, and Behavioral Intentions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We are reporting 3 patients who presented acute zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), an activation of varicella-zoster virus, after mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seen directly or referred to our center.

A 69-year-old woman presented HZO in her V1 left dermatome, occurring 10 days after her first dose of Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. A 72-year-old woman with no history of autoimmune pathology, candidate for cataract surgery, presented 13 days after the first dose of a Moderna mRNA vaccine with an eruption in the left V1 dermatome.

CONCLUSION: Vaccines have been reported in the past to trigger different types of side effects such as viral or flu-like symptoms. It is only logical to note many different side effects for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as the population vaccinated is exceeding any other number in history. VZV is one of the more severe side effects that can, however, be treated.

Previous studies indicate that clinical samples collected from individuals infected with the Delta variant may contain higher levels of RNA than previous variants, but the relationship between viral RNA and infectious virus for individual variants is unknown. METHODS: We measured infectious viral titer (using a micro-focus forming assay) as well as total and subgenomic viral RNA levels (using RT-PCR) in a set of 165 clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Delta and Epsilon variants that were processed within two days of collection from the patient. RESULTS: We observed a high degree of variation in the relationship between viral titers and RNA levels. Despite the variability we observed for individual samples the overall infectivity differed among the three variants. Both Delta and Epsilon had significantly higher infectivity than Alpha, as measured by the number of infectious units per quantity of viral E gene RNA (6 and 4 times as much, p=0.0002 and 0.009 respectively) or subgenomic E RNA (11 and 7 times as much, p<0.0001 and 0.006 respectively). CONCLUSION: In addition to higher viral RNA levels reported for the Delta variant, the infectivity (amount of replication competent virus per viral genome copy) may also be increased compared to Alpha. Measuring the relationship between live virus and viral RNA is an important step in assessing the infectivity of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. An increase in the infectivity of the Delta variant may further explain increased spread and suggests a need for increased measures to prevent viral transmission.","output":"Quantitative measurement of infectious virus in SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Delta and Epsilon variants reveals higher infectivity (viral titer:RNA ratio) in clinical samples containing the Delta and Epsilon variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 2019) pandemic has presented myriad challenges to an underprepared health care system.

We, thus, anticipate that neighborhoods would be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 if they are of present-day economic and racial disadvantage and were redlined historically. To test this expectation, we examined the change of both confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from April to July, 2020, in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the New York City using multilevel regression analysis. The results indicate that ZCTAs with a higher proportion of black and Hispanic populations are associated with a higher percentage of COVID-19 infection. Historically low-graded neighborhoods show a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, even for ZCTAs with present-day economic and racial privilege. These associations change over time as the pandemic unfolds. Racial/ethnic minorities are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemics health impact.

Methods: We conducted a mixed-method longitudinal study, involving an online survey of 1003 adults in the West Midlands, UK, 494 of whom were surveyed at two different points in time. Our first time point (T0: May 2020) was during stringent COVID-19 lockdown and the second (T1: September 2020) during a period of more relaxed restrictions. The survey included detailed quantitative questions about fruit and vegetable consumption; questions on physical activity, socio-demographic characteristics, BMI and wellbeing; and qualitative data collection about the reasons behind reported changes. Results: We find no evidence for respondents decreasing their fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown compared to afterwards. If anything, consumption of fruit and vegetables increased by about half a portion daily among women, particularly among those who normally have a long commute. These findings combined with a significant increase in physical activity, suggest that behaviours were healthier during lockdown, consistent with higher self-reported health compared with afterwards. However, there was a marked deterioration in wellbeing during lockdown, and on average participants self-reported being heavier during this period as well. Our qualitative data suggested that an abundance of resources supported higher fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown, for instance, participants had more time, while access issues were one barrier to consumption. Conclusions: Our results are reassuring for those concerned that lockdowns may have adversely affect diets. They may point to the impact of commuting on diet, particularly for women, and intervening to reduce commuting times may be one way to improve population diets.

Ceramide is the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism. In addition to being the precursor of complex sphingolipids, ceramides induce cell cycle arrest and promote cell death and inflammation. At least some of the enzymes involved in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism are altered in carcinogenesis, and some are targets for anticancer drugs. A number of scientific reports have shown how alterations in sphingolipid pools can affect cell proliferation, survival and migration. Determination of sphingolipid levels and the regulation of the enzymes that are implicated in their metabolism is a key factor for developing novel therapeutic strategies or improving conventional therapies. The present review highlights the importance of bioactive sphingolipids and their regulatory enzymes as targets for therapeutic interventions with especial emphasis in carcinogenesis and cancer dissemination.","output":"Ceramide Metabolism EnzymesTherapeutic Targets against Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secondary bacterial lung infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) poses a serious health concern, especially in developing countries. We posit that the emergence of multiantibiotic-resistant strains will jeopardize current treatments in these regions. Deaths arising from secondary infections are more often associated with acute lung injury, a common consequence of hypercytokinemia, than with the infection per se. Given that secondary bacterial pneumonia often has a poor prognosis, newer approaches to improve treatment outcomes are urgently needed to reduce the high levels of morbidity and mortality. Using a sequential dual-infection mouse model of secondary bacterial lung infection, we show that host-directed therapy via immunoneutralization of the angiopoietin-like 4 c-isoform (cANGPTL4) reduced pulmonary edema and damage in infected mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that anti-cANGPTL4 treatment improved immune and coagulation functions and reduced internal bleeding and edema. Importantly, anti-cANGPTL4 antibody, when used concurrently with either conventional antibiotics or antipneumolysin antibody, prolonged the median survival of mice compared to monotherapy. Anti-cANGPTL4 treatment enhanced immune cell phagocytosis of bacteria while restricting excessive inflammation. This modification of immune responses improved the disease outcomes of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. Taken together, our study emphasizes that host-directed therapeutic strategies are viable adjuncts to standard antimicrobial treatments.","output":"Antibody Treatment against Angiopoietin-Like 4 Reduces Pulmonary Edema and Injury in Secondary Pneumococcal Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients' data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naive T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.","output":"Model-based cellular kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection: different immune response modes and treatment strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological well-being was assessed by affect balance (a function of negative and positive affect) during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 among 4449 clergy and laity in the Church of England.

However, the mechanisms of injury are not fully understood. We sought to determine the significance of race on cardiopulmonary outcomes and in-hospital mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AKI. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized in Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia between February and July 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. We evaluated the primary composite outcome of in-hospital cardiac events, and mortality in blacks with AKI versus non-blacks with AKI. In a subgroup analysis, we evaluated the impact of AKI in all blacks and in all non-blacks. Of 293 patients, effective sample size was 267 after all exclusion criteria were applied. The mean age was 61.4  16.7, 39% were female, and 75 (28.1%) had IH-AKI. In multivariable analyses, blacks with IH-AKI were not more likely to have in-hospital cardiac events (aOR 0.3, 95% Confidence interval (CI) 0.04-1.86, p = 0.18), require ICU stay (aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.20-3.25, p = 0.75), acute respiratory distress syndrome (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.16-3.65, p = 0.74), require mechanical ventilation (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.12-2.10, p = 0.35), and in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 0.26-7.50, p = 0.70) when compared to non-blacks with IH-AKI.

Objective: This study aimed to examine the effects of PAHs on the human health risks associated with long-term exposure both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: PM10 sampling for 24 h was conducted at six sampling sites (Al-Haram, Aziziyah, Al Nuzhah, Muzdalifah, Arafat, and Al Awali). On-site measurements were conducted from March 2020 to February 2021. PAHs were analyzed using Perkin Elmer GC/MS, which was adjusted with standard reagents for identifying 16 PAH mixtures. Results: The 24 h average PM10 concentration showed considerable inconsistencies, exceeding the WHO standards used for median exposure (25.0 gm(?3)). The PAH intensities fluctuated from 7.67 to 34.7 ng/m(3) in a suburban area, near a rush-hour traffic road, and from 6.34 to 37.4 ng/m(3) close to business and light manufacturing areas. The highest carcinogenic compound levels were found in the Al-Azizia, Al Muzdalifah, and Al Nuzah areas because of the high traffic density, and the lowest concentrations were found in the Al-Haram and Arafat areas throughout the year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic health precautions that were undertaken by the government of Saudi Arabia involving border entry limits and limitations of the Umrah and Hajj seasons.

RESULTS A total of 261 individuals completed the survey. Most (76%) reported delivering in-person testing in some capacity at the time of our survey. Relatively more private practitioners identified concerns with privacy/confidentiality (45.2% vs. 17.9%;  2(2) = 6.99, p < 0.05), legal issues (47.6% vs. 17.9%;  2(2) = 8.06, p < 0.05), and an undesirable precedent for legal/forensic cases (59.5% vs. 15.4%;  2(2) = 17.54, p < 0.001) compared to hospital or other medical (non-VA) practitioners. Multiple resources informed teleNP protocols, such as organization guidelines (87.6%), literature review (75.9%), webinars (72.4%), and consultation (68%). Several factors influenced test selection, including availability of normative data (70.1%), test familiarity (66.4%), administration time (63.5%), and evidence base (60.6%).

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that when appropriate strategies are adopted autopsy is a safe procedure with a minimal infection risk for all subjects involved (pathologists, technical personnel, and others) when proper strategies are adopted. We performed 16 autopsies on cadavers of persons who had died with confirmed COVID-19 with different post-mortem intervals (PMI). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, for each autopsy, 2 swabs were sampled from lungs, while to evaluate environmental contamination, 11 swabs were taken at three different times: T0 (before autopsy), T1 (at the end of the autopsy, without removing the corpse), and T2 (after cleaning and disinfecting the autopsy room). Specifically, 2 swabs were sampled on face shields used by each pathologist, and 4 swabs were collected on the autopsy table; 4 swabs were also collected from walls and 1 from floor. Lung swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases. Environmental swabs, collected at T0 and T2 were all negative, while swabs sampled at T1 were shown to be positive.

Suspected cases of COVID-19 need rapid, early and accurate detection to prevent the spread on a large scale. Existing tests for COVID-19 diagnosis are slow and need a few hours to generate the results. The situation is even worsened in developing countries such as Pakistan due to the lack/limited facilities of reliable COVID detection test. Moreover, existing tests like PCR are not highly reliable and often result in an incorrect diagnosis. Early and reliable COVID-19 diagnosis is vital to reduce the complications in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different deep learning-based feature extraction models for COVID-19 detection. Towards this end, we have employed twelve pretrained deep learning models, i.e., Mobilnetv2, Darknet19, Densenet201, Squeeznet, Alexnet, Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Inceptionresnetv2, Resnet50, Resnet18, Resnet101 and Shufflenet for features extraction from the chest radiograph images. The support vector machine (SVM) was then trained using these features for classification of chest radiograph images into COVID or non-COVID/normal. We evaluated the performance of each deep learning model on a standard COVID-19 Radiography Database that consists of 13808 Chest X-Ray images including 3616 COVID-19 positive images and 10192 X-ray COVID-19 negative images.

Entamoeba histolytica is a major cause of amebic diarrhea in developing countries. It colonizes the colon lumen in close proximity to the gut microbiota. Interestingly, not all individuals are equally susceptible to E. histolytica infection. Therefore, as the microbiota is highly variable within individuals, we sought to determine if a component of the microbiota could regulate susceptibility to infection. In studies utilizing a murine model, we demonstrated that colonization of the gut with the commensal Clostridia-related bacteria known as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) is protective during E. histolytica infection. SFB colonization in this model was associated with elevated cecal levels of interleukin 17A (IL-17A), dendritic cells, and neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from SFB-colonized mice had higher levels of IL-23 production in response to stimulation with trophozoites. Adoptive transfer of BMDCs from an SFB(+) to an SFB(?) mouse was sufficient to provide protection against E. histolytica. IL-17A induction during BMDC transfer was necessary for this protection. This work demonstrates that intestinal colonization with a specific commensal bacterium can provide protection during amebiasis in a murine model. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the microbiome can mediate protection against an enteric infection via extraintestinal effects on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.","output":"Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells from Mice with an Altered Microbiota Provide Interleukin 17A-Dependent Protection against Entamoeba histolytica Colitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease is a respiratory infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known colloquially as COVID-19 virus.

Whereas the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in IPF remains uncertain and needs to be further elucidated. Methods: The FerrDb database and the previous studies were screened to explore the FRGs. The data of patients with IPF were obtained from the GSE70866 dataset. Wilcoxon's test and univariate Cox regression analysis were applied to identify the FRGs that are differentially expressed between normal and patients with IPF and associated with prognosis. Next, a multigene signature was constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox model in the training cohort and evaluated by using calibration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Then, 30% of the dataset samples were randomly selected for internal validation. Finally, the potential function and pathways that might be affected by the risk score-related differently expressed genes (DEGs) were further explored. Results: A total of 183 FRGs were identified by the FerrDb database and the previous studies, and 19 of them were differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) between IPF and healthy controls and associated with prognosis (p < 0.05).

Several approaches such as psycho-emotional care and an increase in spirituality have been suggested to diminish these complications. However, the knowledge about the effects of family-based dignity intervention and expressive writing on anticipatory grief in family caregivers of dying cancer patients is limited. This is a study protocol describing a hospital-based mixed-methods study on the effects of family-based dignity intervention and expressive writing on anticipatory grief in family caregivers of dying cancer patients. METHODS: This mixed-methods study will be done in an embedded explanatory design with two quantitative and qualitative phases. In the first phase (quantitative), a randomized clinical trial will be done, in which 200 family caregivers of dying cancer patients will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups: family-based single dignity intervention (group 1), expressive writing intervention (group 2), combined family-based single dignity intervention and expressive writing (group 3), and control (group 4). At baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks after the interventions, anticipatory grief will be assessed by a 13-item anticipatory grief scale. After the quantitative phase, the qualitative phase will be conducted through the conventional content analysis approach of Granheim and Lundman, in which an individual semi-structured interview will be taken from participants in the first phase to collect data on their experiences on interventions. Finally, data from the quantitative and qualitative phases will be analyzed and discussed. DISCUSSION: Family caregivers of dying cancer patients usually experience depression, anxiety, and psychological distress due to isolation and inadequate social support. Psychological interventions such as dignity and expressive writing interventions may help caregivers to obtain a better understanding of themselves and to increase their abilities to cope with caregiving difficulties.

Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe's emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration. The contribution of resistant microbes from various sources seems to be the major base of resistance in the environment.

To increase political legitimacy and accountability, public support is important. This study examines what criteria beyond medical need are deemed important to be perceived of priority COVID-19 healthcare access. METHOD: Two conjoint experiments about priority over ICU treatment and early COVID-19 vaccination were implemented in a probability-based sample of 1461 respondents representative of the Netherlands. Respondents were asked who should receive treatment out of two fictitious healthcare claimants that differed in in age, weight, complying with corona policy measures, and occupation, all randomly assigned. Average marginal coefficient effects are estimated to assess the relative importance of the attributes; attributes were interacted with relevant respondent characteristics to find whether consensus exists in this relative ranking. RESULTS: The Dutch penalize those not complying with coronavirus policy measures, and the obese, but prioritize those employed in 'crucial' sectors. For these conditions, there is consensus among the population. For age, young people are prioritized for ICU treatment, while the middle-aged are given priority over a vaccine, with younger respondents favoring healthcare for elderly claimants, while older respondents favor support for young cohorts. CONCLUSION: People who have no control over their social risk and are able to reciprocate to society are considered as more deserving of priority of COVID-19 healthcare.

Data were analyzed from COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a single hospital in Wuhan, China, collected retrospectively from Jan 24th to Mar 27th. Clinical, demographic, treatment and laboratory data were collected from patients' medical records. Uni- and multivariable analysis using logistic regression and random forest, with the latter allowing the study of non-linear influences, were performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of a severe disease course. A total of 762 young patients (median age 47 years, interquartile range [IQR] 38-55, range 18-60; 55.9% female) were included, as well as 714 elderly patients as a comparison group. Among the young patients, 362 (47.5%) had a severe/critical disease course and the mean age was statistically significantly higher in the severe subgroup than in the mild subgroup (59.3 vs. 56.0, Student's t-test: p < 0.001). The uni- and multivariable analysis suggested that several covariates such as elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased lymphocyte counts influence disease severity independently of age.

The first entry of the virus might have occurred around very late 2019/early 2020, as suggested by the time to the most recent common ancestor, followed by a rapid community transmission that led to dominancy of B.4 lineage in early epidemic till the end of June. Gradually, reduction in dominancy of B.4 occurred possibly as a result of other entries of the virus, followed by surge of B.1* lineages, as of mid-May. Remarkably, variation tracking of the virus indicated the increase in frequency of D614G mutation, along with B.1* lineages, which showed continuity till October 2020. The increase in frequency of D614G mutation and B.1* lineages from mid-May onwards predicts a rapid viral transmission that may push the country into a critical health situation followed by a considerable change in composition of viral lineages circulating in the country.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran: The dynamics of the epidemic and evidence on two independent introductions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world continues to grapple with the reality of coronavirus disease, global research communities are racing to develop practical solutions to adjust to the new challenges. One such challenge is the control of indoor air quality in the COVID-19 era and beyond. Since COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the super spread of the virus has continued to amaze policymakers despite measures put in place by public health officials to sensitize the general public on the need for social distancing, personal hygiene, etc. In this work, we have reviewed the literature to demonstrate, by investigating the historical and present circumstances, that indoor spread of infectious diseases may be assisted by the conditions of the HVAC systems. While little consideration has been given to the possibility of indoor airborne transmission of the virus, the available reports have demonstrated that the virus, with average aerodynamic diameter up to 80C120 nm, is viable as aerosol in indoor atmosphere for more than 3 h, and its spread may be assisted by the HVAC systems. Having reviewed the vulnerability of the conventional ventilation systems, we recommend innovative air circulation concept supported by the use of UVGI in combination with nanoporous air filter to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other harmful microbes in enclosed spaces.","output":"Addressing COVID-19 contagion through the HVAC systems by reviewing indoor airborne nature of infectious microbes: Will an innovative air recirculation concept provide a practical solution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To supplement preexisting wellness programming for the surgery clerkship, a faculty surgeon at Vanderbilt initiated Fireside Chats (FC) in 2015.

The purpose of the study is to establish the patterns of implementation of interest lobbying policy in Europe and assessing the reliability of lobbying activities in European countries and EU institutions to check the effectiveness of lobbying interests' modern experience in Europe and mechanisms in ensuring transparency and its integrity in the EU. Research methods: comparative analysis;regression analysis;systematization, generalization. Results. Availability has established the relationship between disclosure by lobbyists and oversight of compliance with the rules of the register and transparency in lobbying. Lobby transparency has been identified as too weak across Europe, as the implementation of the Transparency Register, which aims to regulate lobbying, has not protected against its excessive influence. The largest expenditure on EU lobbying for the period 2017-2018 falls on countries such as Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The current expenditure of EU member states is 91%, more than 2 billion. It was found that lobbying in Europe helps to solve current problems by further improving the legislation that will ensure the implementation of effective EU policy, where the main topics on the agenda are the implementation of the Law on Digital Services and overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.

As sleep disturbances in school children are common, prevention of chronification is essential. The aim of this study was to adapt an established age-oriented cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) group training for 5C10-year-old children with insomnia and their parents to an online version (group iCBT-I). METHODS: The adaptation procedure and structure of the iCBT?I are described. To assess acceptance the Online Sleep Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were implemented. In addition, trainers filled in the Adherence and Feasibility Questionnaire for Online Sleep Treatment (AFOST). Sleep problems were assessed using a structured interview for sleep disorders in children and clinical interview, and the Childrens Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ-DE). Emotional problems were evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 4-18). RESULTS: This pilot study included 12 parents and 6 children fulfilling insomnia criteria prior to online training. The adapted online version consisted of three parental sessions, whereas child-oriented sessions were transferred into videoclips. The new group iCBT?I was well accepted by parents. Parents scored the online version as helpful and time saving based on the OSTA and trainers estimated the adapted version to be feasible and effective. According to AFOST, adherence was given.

We examined the infection rates among a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW) in South India during the second wave driven mainly by the delta variant and examined the protective effect of prior COVID-19 disease and vaccination. Methods: Symptomatic HCWs were routinely tested by RT-PCR per institutional policy. Vaccination was offered to all HCWs between January and June 2021, and the details were documented. We set up a non-concurrent cohort to estimate infection rates and estimated efficacy of prior infection and vaccination between 16th Apr to 30th May, 2021, using a cox-proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates adjusting for daily incidence. Findings: Between June 2020 and May 2021, 2735 (23.9%) of 11,405 HCWs were infected, with 1412, including 32 re-infections, reported during the second wave. 6863 HCWs received two doses of vaccine and 1905 one dose. The protective efficacy of prior infection against symptomatic infection was 86.0% (95%CI 76.7% - 91.6%). Vaccination combined with prior infection provided 91.1% (95%CI 84.1% - 94.9%) efficacy. In the absence of prior infection, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection during the second wave was 31.8% (95%CI 23.5% C 39.1%).

Patients with severe COVID-19 commonly present with viral pneumonia that may progress to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with COVID-19 are also predisposed to venous and arterial thromboses that are associated with a poorer prognosis.

These cells demonstrated proinflammatory gene signatures, activated platelets, spontaneously formed neutrophil extracellular traps, and enhanced phagocytic capacity and cytokine production. Strikingly, CD16(Int) neutrophils were also the major immune cells within the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, exhibiting increased CXCR3 but loss of CD44 and CD38 expression.

These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed. Purpose: This study investigated changes in COVID-19 prevention behaviours from April-July 2020, and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours. Methods: 1,843 participants in Australia completed a national COVID-19 survey in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Principal components analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours. Multivariable regression models explored baseline (April) correlates of behaviour in June (a period of low community transmission) and July (a period of increasing community transmission). Results: On average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). PCA identified two behaviour types:'distancing' (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and 'hygiene' (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing declined each month (p's<.001), whereas hygiene remained relatively stable. For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated with adherence in June and July (p's<0.05). For hygiene, the only significant correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that one's actions could prevent infection of family members (p<.001).

The results show that the optimized LPCL-NP2 formulation (composed of low molecular weight polycaprolactone, 500 mg of Kolliphor P188, 0.25% chitosan hydrochloride, and 50 mg ofloxacin) displayed a sphere shape with EE%, PS, PDI, and ZP values of 89.73  0.04%, 195.4  13.17 nm, 0.323  0.01, and 55.4  0.66 mV, respectively. DSC study confirmed the amorphous nature of the drug. The optimized nanoparticle formulation was then further incorporated into the following two ocular formulations: gel (LPCL-NP2-G4) and in situ forming gel (LPCL-NP2-ISG4). The penetration of optimized ocular formulations was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The antimicrobial study was conducted for the following three ocular formulations: LPCL-NP2 presented as eye drops, LPCL-NP2-G4, and LPCL-NP2-ISG4 as well as the market product using rabbits which were infected in their eyes with Escherichia coli. Results revealed that rabbits treated with LPCL-NP2-ISG4 demonstrated a remarkable antibacterial efficacy and evident low bacterial growth which was additionally assured by the histopathological examination of eye biopsies compared with the other investigated groups. Thus, a novel ofloxacin-loaded nanoparticle formulation based on polycaprolactone is presented in the form of mucoadhesive non-irritating in situ forming ocular gel possessing a superior antibacterial activity.

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called \\"knowns\\", and there are more we do not know called \\"unknowns\\". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently, it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype-based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to \\"open\\" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category.

Starting from the dietary ingredients traditionally used, soybean was totally replaced by pea bean. The experimental diets were also compared from an environmental point of view simulating the annual global warming potential of the diets. Neither genotype nor dietary treatment affected feed consumption and growth performance, suggesting that the total replacement of soybean with pea bean can be a valuable feeding strategy, also from the economic point of view. A diet containing pea slightly reduced the total greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emitted on a yearly basis. The results of the present study suggest that replacing soybean with pea bean can be a sustainable feeding strategy in broiler chicken production of inner Mediterranean areas, from both economic and environmental perspectives. ABSTRACT: The effects of Glycine max L. (SOY) vs. Pisum sativum L. (PEA) in the diet were investigated on in vivo performance of two medium-growing broiler genotypes and on environmental impact. Sixty Kabir Red Plus and sixty New Red chickens were randomly allocated in 20 pens (n = 6 birds per pen). Each pen, i.e., experimental unit, received 1.18 kg dry matter (DM) including soybean (3.39%) in SOY, or pea bean (6.78%) in PEA groups. DM intake, DM refusals and bodyweight (BW) were recorded on pen basis, and average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion rate (FCR) were calculated. Data on in vivo performance were processed by ANOVA General Linear Model followed by StudentCNewmanCKeuls post hoc test. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were evaluated on a year basis by GLEAM-i software. The diet did not affect (p > 0.05) DM intake and DM refusals, BW, ADG and FCR. Diet x genotypes affected (p < 0.05) DM intake and DM refusals. PEA diet, cheaper than SOY diet, allowed the reduction in total GHG and CO(2), and of meat emission intensity. However, an increase in total CH(4) and N(2)O emissions was observed. The replacement of soybean with pea bean can represent a possible management strategy to reach trade-off between good farming practices and environmental protection on small-scale poultry farms of inner Mediterranean areas.","output":"Soybean vs. Pea Bean in the Diet of Medium-Growing Broiler Chickens Raised under Semi-Intensive Conditions of Inner Mediterranean Areas: Growth Performance and Environmental Impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chiral surfaces are critical components of enantioselective heterogeneous processes such as those used to prepare enantiomerically pure pharmaceuticals.

FINDINGS: 15,586 individuals tested for COVID-19 at the Cleveland Clinic between March 8, 2020 and May 13, 2020 met our inclusion criteria. 12.4% of COPD patients (164/1319) tested positive for COVID-19 compared to 16.6% (2363/14,267) of the non-COPD population. 48.2% (79/164) of COVID-19 positive COPD patients required hospitalization and 45.6% (36/79) required ICU admission. After adjustment for covariates, rates of COVID-19 infection were not significantly different than the non-COPD population (adj OR 0.97; CI: 0.89C1.05), but COPD patients had increased healthcare utilization as demonstrated by risk for hospitalization (adj OR 1.36; CI: 1.15C1.60), ICU admission (OR 1.20; CI: 1.02C1.40), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (adj OR 1.49; CI: 1.28C1.73).

Vaccination induced robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers that were maintained at high levels for at least one year after two doses (Pseudovirus nAb GMT: 2207, Live-virus nAb GMT: 1964) against the ancestral strain, but not against Omicron. However, a booster dose at 6-12 months with RBD-Wu or RBD-{beta} (RBD from the Beta variant) displayed on I53-50 elicited equivalent and remarkably high neutralizing titers against the ancestral as well as the Omicron variant.

Wound healing in horses is distinct to that documented in other species, and often results in delayed healing and extensive scarring, with compromised functional and aesthetic outcomes. To date, there is no conventional method objectively proven to accelerate healing or to successfully prevent complications associated with second intention healing. Several effects of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) may be particularly useful to the management of wounds in horses. However, cumbersome designs of classic NPWT devices render them unsuitable for equine practice. A new lightweight, portable and disposable unit of NPWT (PICO?), should facilitate the use of this modality by equine practitioners. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using this canister-free system to treat experimental open wounds in horses. RESULTS No difficulties were encountered with the application or maintenance of the PICO? system during the ex vivo experiment or during the preliminary in vivo experiment conducted on intact skin. All horses readily tolerated the PICO? but difficulties with adhesion and seal prevented the completion of the experimental wound study despite the use of many adjunctive adhesives. CONCLUSION The current PICO? dressing design is not suitable to be used as a dressing for open wounds in horses though the device is well tolerated by equine patients.

Transport authorities have implemented several strategies to reduce traffic jams with varying degrees of success. The use of reversible lanes is a common approach to improve traffic congestion during rush hours. A reversible lane can change its direction during a time interval to the more congested direction. This strategy can improve traffic congestion in specific scenarios. Most reversible lanes in urban roads are fixed in time and number; however, traffic patterns in cities are highly variable and unpredictable due to this phenomenon's complex nature. Therefore, reversible lanes may not improve traffic flow under certain circumstances; moreover, they could worsen it because of traffic fluctuations. In this paper, we use cellular automata to model adaptive reversible lanes(aka dynamic reversible lanes). Adaptive reversible lanes can change their direction using real-time information to respond to traffic demand fluctuations. Using real traffic data, our model shows that adaptive reversible lanes can improve traffic flow up to 40% compared to conventional reversible lanes.

This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of acute pulmonary hypertension (aPH) as per established trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) criteria in Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care and to explore whether short-term outcomes are affected by the presence of aPH. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patients treated in the intensive care units at a tertiary university hospital over a month. The presence of aPH on the TTE was noted, and plasma NTproBNP and troponin were measured as markers of cardiac failure and myocardial injury, respectively. Follow-up data were collected 21 d after the performance of TTE. RESULTS: In total, 26 of 67 patients (39%) had an assessed systolic pulmonary artery pressure of > 35 mmHg (group aPH), meeting the TTE definition of aPH.

RESULTS Six of the eleven patients completing the study responded to RGRN-305 with a PASI improvement between 71% and 94%, whereas five patients were considered nonresponders with a PASI response < 50%. No severe adverse events were reported. Four of seven patients treated with 500 mg RGRN-305 daily experienced a mild to moderate exanthematous drug induced eruption due to study treatment. Two patients chose to discontinue the study due to this exanthematous eruption. RGRN-305 treatment resulted in pronounced inhibition of the IL-23, TNF, and IL-17A signaling pathways and normalization of both histological changes and psoriatic lesion gene expression profiles in patients responding to treatment. CONCLUSION Treatment with RGRN-305 showed an acceptable safety, especially in the low-dose group, and was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in a subset of patients with plaque psoriasis, indicating that HSP90 may serve as a novel future target in psoriasis treatment.","output":"HSP90 inhibitor RGRN-305 for oral treatment of plaque type psoriasis: efficacy, safety and biomarker results in an open-label proof-of-concept study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by an inflammatory response and lung injury that can evolve into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that needs support treatment in intensive care unit. Nutritional treatment is an important component of the management of critically ill patients and should be started in the first 48 h of ICU admission to avoid malnutrition. This study describes the characteristics of the patients treated in a tertiary hospital in Madrid during the months of MarchCMay 2020 (first wave), the medical nutrition treatment employed and its influence in the clinical outcome of these patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU that needed medical nutrition treatment (MNT). Collected variables included sex, age, BMI, underlying diseases, time from hospitalisation to ICU admission, type of respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (non-IMV)), caloric and protein requirements (25 kcal/kg adjusted body weight (ABW), 1.3 g/kg ABW/day), MNT type (enteral nutrition (EN), parenteral nutrition (PN), mixed EN + PN), total calories (including propofol) and proteins administered, percentage of caloric and protein goal in ICU day 4th and 7th, metabolic complications, acute kidney failure (AKF), length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data are expressed as mean  SD, median (IQR) or frequencies. Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included (72.7% male), 60.1  13.5 years, BMI 29.9  5.4 kg/m(2). Underlying diseases included 47.4% overweight, 39.8% obesity, 49.1% hypertension, 41.4% dyslipidaemia. 88.6% of patients needed IMV, 89.1% prone position, 2.9% ECMO. Time to ICU admission: 2 (4.75) days. Estimated caloric and protein requirements were 1775  202 kcal and 92.4  10.3 g. Calories and proteins administered at days 4th and 7th were 1425  577 kcal and 66  26 g and 1574  555 and 74  37, respectively. Most of the patients received PN (alone or complementary to EN) to cover nutritional requirements (82.4% at day 4th and 77.9% at day 7th). IVM patients received more calories and proteins during the first week of ICU admission. Complications included 77.8% hyperglycaemia, 13.2% hypoglycaemia, 83.8% hypertriglyceridemia, and 35.1% AKF. ICU LOS was 20.5 (26) days. The mortality rate was 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the majority of patients reached energy and protein requirements in the first week of ICU admission due to the use of PN (total or complementary to EN). Patients with HFNC or non-IMV may be at risk of malnutrition if total or complementary PN to oral diet/ONS/tube feeding is not used to cover nutritional requirements. Therefore, if EN is not possible or insufficient, PN can be safely used in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a close monitoring of metabolic complications.","output":"Nutritional management and clinical outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19: A retrospective study in a tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the effects of home-and center-based exercise training programs on functional capacity, inspiratory muscle strength, daily physical activity level, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) over a 12-week period. METHODS: This study included 23 patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 316%) randomized to a home-based (n=11) or center-based (n=12) program. Patients underwent 12 weeks of aerobic training (60%-70% heart rate reserve): walking for the home-based and supervised cycling for the center-based group, both combined with resistance training (50% of 1 maximum repetition). At baseline and after 12 weeks of training, we assessed cardiopulmonary test variables, 6-min walk test distance (6 MWD), steps/day with accelerometry, and QoL (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire). Maximal inspiratory pressure and handgrip strength were measured at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of training. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03615157. RESULTS: There were no adverse events during training in either group. The home- and center-based training groups obtained similar improvements in peak oxygen uptake, maximal ventilation, and 6 MWD. However, there were significant between-group differences: center-based training was more effective in improving maximal inspiratory pressure (p=0.042), number of steps/day (p=0.001), and QoL (p=0.039).

In this nationwide registry, we compared treatment delays and outcomes of patients with acute MI in Covid-19 pandemic period with a recent pre-pandemic registry conducted at the same centres. Methods: A recent nationwide registry (TURKMI-1) enrolled consecutive patients with acute MI in November 1-15, 2018 in Turkey, and assessed time delay at each step from symptom-onset to treatment and outcomes. Fifty centres were selected using probability sampling. In the present study (TURKMI-2), the same information was obtained from 48 of the same 50 centres during the pandemic between April 17 and May 2, 2020. Findings: In a 2-week period, 991 patients (511% NSTEMI, 489% STEMI) were admitted to the study centres within the 48-hour of symptom-onset. Compared with the TURKMI-1, admissions decreased by 312% in ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), and 564% in non-STEMI (NSTEMI). Median time from symptom-onset to hospital-arrival increased from 295 min to 419 min in NSTEMI, and from 150 min to 185 min in STEMI (p-values <0001). Door-to-balloon time was similar in the two periods (37 vs. 40 min, p=0448), however, total ischaemic time increased significantly (195 min vs 245 min, p=0001) mainly due to patient-related delay. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was decreased especially in the NSTEMI group (603% vs 474% in NSTEMI, p<0001;948% vs 911% in STEMI, p=0013). Major cardiac adverse events (MACE) defined as in-hospital death, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock were significantly higher in the pandemic period compared to non-pandemic (48% vs 89%;p <0001). Age and sex adjusted risk of MACE was two times higher during pandemic (Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] was 196 [120-322] for NSTEMI, p=0007;and 208 [138-313] for STEMI, p<0001). Interpretation: Besides the overall 471% reduction in acute MI admissions, there was a significant patient related treatment delay during the pandemic. Although PCI was performed in a timely fashion, increase in total ischaemic time and decrease in PCI might be responsible for the increased risk of MACE in acute MI.

The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between COPD and abundant microaspiration in intubated critically ill patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, provided by 3 randomized controlled trials on microaspiration in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. Abundant microaspiration was defined as the presence of pepsin and or alpha-amylase at significant levels in tracheal aspirates. In all study patients, pepsin and alpha-amylase were quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates collected during a 48-h period. COPD was defined using spirometry criteria. RESULTS: Among the 515 included patients, 70 (14%) had proven COPD. Pepsin and alpha-amylase were quantitatively measured in 3873 and 3764 tracheal aspirates, respectively. No significant difference was found in abundant microaspiration rate between COPD and non-COPD patients (62 of 70 patients (89%) vs 366 of 445 (82%) patients, p = 0.25).

Existing data are largely drawn from small case series at IBD referral centers or national registries lacking granular longitudinal outpatient data. Our aim was to determine whether there are racial or socioeconomic disparities in acute care utilization as measured by hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits within a large national cohort of IBD patients. METHODS National Veterans Heath Administration (VHA) data were used to examine baseline disease characteristics and two years of utilization following an index outpatient gastroenterology visit for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in 2017. To account for patients more likely to access care outside the VHA, we excluded those with less than four unique VHA encounters per year. We compared differences in comorbidity burden [Charlson comorbidity index, (CCI)], disease duration, surgical history and modifiable IBD severity risk factors (opioid use, tobacco use, biologic agent use, anemia, malnutrition) based on race and area deprivation index (ADI), a multidimensional marker for regional socioeconomic status (SES). Negative binomial regression was used to model demographic and clinical risk factors associated with hospitalization and ED visits. RESULTS 19,442 patients (47.4% with CD and 52.6% with UC) were included: 14% Black, 5% Hispanic and 76% White. Compared to White patients, Black patients were younger, more likely to have anemia, perianal disease, and be in the bottom quartile of ADI; they were less likely to have a history of intestinal resection. IBD type, disease duration, CCI, and rates of tobacco use, opioid use, and malnutrition were not different between Black and White patients. On bivariate analysis, Black patients had increased mean and median ED visits compared to White patients (mean 4.48 vs 3.32; p < 0.001) though no differences were seen in hospitalizations (mean 0.96 vs 0.92; p=NS). On stepwise multivariable modeling, hospitalization and ED utilization were significantly higher among Black patients when controlling for age, sex, type of IBD, and disease duration [OR for hospitalization: 1.114 (95% CI: 1.046-1.199); OR for ED visit: 1.191 (95% CI: 1.125-1.261)]. After sequential adjustment for CCI and modifiable IBD severity risk factors, no differences in hospitalizations were seen between Black and White patients. In the full model for ED visits including adjustments for modifiable IBD severity risk factors (all significant), Black race was significantly associated with increased frequency of ED access [OR: 1.261 (95% CI: 1.19-1.336)], while ADI was not. CONCLUSION In this analysis of a large national outpatient cohort of patients with IBD, we identified significant racial differences in IBD disease behavior, anemia and subsequent acute care utilization. Racial differences in hospitalization were not significant after controlling for modifiable IBD risk factors suggesting actionable targets to mitigate the observed disparities. However, Black race was independently associated with ED utilization even in a healthcare system where access to care is theoretically similar. Future studies should investigate factors underlying increased ED utilization among Black IBD patients in further detail.","output":"P068 Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Acute Care Utilization in a National Cohort of Veterans With IBD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by dysregulation of effector T cells and accumulation of exhausted T cells.

Severe SARS-CoV-2-associated disease (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and is characterized by cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some cases by systemic inflammation-related pathology. Currently, our knowledge of the determinants of severe COVID-19 is primarily observational.

Several methods tend to overestimate the basic (R_0) and effective (R_t) reproduction numbers during the initial phases of an epidemic. The reasons driving the observed bias are unknown. In this work we explore the impact of incomplete observations and underreporting of the first generations of infections during the initial epidemic phase. Methods We propose a debiasing procedure which utilises a linear exponential growth model to infer unobserved initial generations of infections and apply it to EpiEstim. We assess the performance of our adjustment using simulated data, considering different levels of transmissibility and reporting rates. We also apply the proposed correction to reported SARS-CoV-2 incidence data reported in Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Results In all simulation scenarios, our adjustment outperforms the original EpiEstim method. The proposed correction reduces the systematic bias and the quantification of uncertainty is more precise, as better coverage of the true R_0 values is achieved with tighter credible intervals. When applied to real world data, the proposed adjustment produces basic reproduction number estimates which closely match the estimates obtained in other studies while making use of a minimal amount of data. Conclusions The proposed adjustment refines the reproduction number estimates obtained with the current EpiEstim implementation by producing improved, more precise estimates earlier than with the original method.

Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed.

The results showed a growth of some pathogenic bacteria in pregnant women, including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the selective growth of the Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella species, probably due to the fact that these bacteria use progesterone as a source of nutrition.

Raw wastewater consists of small particles, or solids, suspended in liquid. Methods have been developed to measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the liquid and the solid fraction of wastewater, with some studies reporting higher concentrations in the solid fraction. To investigate this relationship further, six laboratories collaborated to conduct a study across five publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) where both primary settled solids obtained from primary clarifiers and raw wastewater influent samples were collected and quantified for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Settled solids and influent samples were processed by participating laboratories using their respective methods and retrospectively paired based on date of collection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, on a mass equivalent basis, were higher in settled solids than in influent by approximately three orders of magnitude. Concentrations in matched settled solids and influent were positively and significantly correlated at all five POTWs. RNA concentrations in both settled solids and influent were correlated to COVID-19 incidence rates in the sewersheds and thus representative of disease occurrence; the settled solids methods appeared to produce a comparable relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration measurements and incidence rates across all POTWs. Settled solids and influent methods showed comparable sensitivity, N gene detection frequency, and calculated empirical incidence rate lower limits. Analysis of settled solids for SARS-CoV-2 RNA has the advantage of using less sample volume to achieve similar sensitivity to influent methods.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA is enriched by orders of magnitude in primary settled solids relative to liquid wastewater at publicly owned treatment works"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus, which began to be called SARS-CoV-2, is a single-stranded RNA beta coronavirus, initially identified in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) and currently spreading across six continents causing a considerable harm to patients, with no specific tools until now to provide prognostic outcomes. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate possible findings on chest CT of patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory syndromes and positive epidemiological factors for COVID-19 infection and to correlate them with the course of the disease. In this sense, it is also expected to develop specific machine learning algorithm for this purpose, through pulmonary segmentation, which can predict possible prognostic factors, through more accurate results. Our alternative hypothesis is that the machine learning model based on clinical, radiological and epidemiological data will be able to predict the severity prognosis of patients infected with COVID-19. We will perform a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study to obtain a large number of cases in a short period of time, for better study validation. Our convenience sample (at least 20 cases for each outcome) will be collected in each center considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We will evaluate patients who enter the hospital with clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, from March to May 2020. We will include individuals with signs and symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, with positive epidemiological history for COVID-19, who have performed a chest computed tomography. We will assess chest CT of these patients and to correlate them with the course of the disease.

Traditional methods for DPB prediction that depend on manually extracted features may lead to classification errors. Recently, deep learning such as convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to classification tasks and improved DPB prediction performance significantly. Yet, these methods are based on the original DNA sequence modeling, ignoring the hidden complex dependency and complementarity between multiple sequence features. In consideration of this problem, we propose a method to fuse different sequence features and analyze them systematically through multi-scale CNN. First, sliding windows of specified lengths are set on distinct DNA sequences to generate multiple sequence features with unequal lengths. Second, multiple feature sequences are fused and encoded for feature representation. Third, multi-scale CNN with different binding motif lengths is used to automatically learn and mine the influence of internal attributes and hidden complex relations between the fusion sequence features and make full use of the complementary advantages of extracted CNN features to predict DPB. When our model is applied to 690 ChIP-seq datasets, it achieves an average AUC of 0.9112, which is significantly better than the latest methods.

Sampling several spots in primary, secondary and sludge treatment at the Ourense (Spain) WWTP in 5 different days showed that, in effect, most of SARS-CoV-2 particles cannot be detected in the water effluent as they are retained by the sludge line. We identified the sludge thickener as a suitable spot for detecting SARS-CoV-2 particles thanks to its higher solids concentration (more virus particles) and longer residence time (less sensitive to dilution caused by precipitation).

PC-lipids account for 40% of the entire pool of lipids in the canalicular membrane with an unknown distribution over both leaflets. Extracted PC lipids end up in so-called mixed micelles.

We designed and implemented pharmaceutical and healthy lifestyle interventions for patients with diabetes and/or hypertension in rural primary care, and assessed their effectiveness at reducing severe CVD events. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a pragmatic, parallel group, 2-arm, controlled, superiority, cluster trial design. We randomised 67 township hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, to intervention (34) or control (33). A total of 31,326 participants were recruited, with 15,380 in the intervention arm and 15,946 in the control arm. Participants had no known CVD and were either patients with hypertension and a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher, or patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of their CVD risk. The intervention included prescription of a standardised package of medicines, individual advice on lifestyle change, and adherence support. Control was usual hypertension and diabetes care. In both arms, as usual in China, most outpatient drug costs were out of pocket. The primary outcome was severe CVD events, including coronary heart disease and stroke, during 36 months of follow-up, as recorded by the CVD surveillance system. The study was implemented between December 2013 and May 2017. A total of 13,385 (87%) and 14,745 (92%) participated in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Their mean age was 64 years, 51% were women, and 90% were farmers. Of all participants, 64% were diagnosed with hypertension with or without diabetes, and 36% were diagnosed with diabetes only. All township hospitals and participants completed the 36-month follow-up. At 36 months, there were 762 and 874 severe CVD events in the intervention and control arms, respectively, yielding a non-significant effect on CVD incidence rate (1.92 and 2.01 per 100 person-years, respectively; crude incidence rate ratio = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.74, 1.08; P = 0.259]). We observed significant, but small, differences in the change from baseline to follow-up for systolic blood pressure (?1.44 mm Hg [95% CI: ?2.26, ?0.62; P < 0.001]) and diastolic blood pressure (?1.29 mm Hg [95% CI: ?1.77, ?0.80; P < 0.001]) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Self-reported adherence to recommended medicines was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared with the control arm at 36 months. No safety concerns were identified. Main study limitations include all participants being informed about their high CVD risk at baseline, non-blinding of participants, and the relatively short follow-up period available for judging potential changes in rates of CVD events. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive package of pharmaceutical and healthy lifestyle interventions did not reduce severe CVD events over 36 months. Improving health system factors such as universal coverage for the cost of essential medicines is required for successful risk-based CVD prevention programmes.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients admitted under code-stroke protocol to our center with a final diagnosis of ischemic brain infarction. We analyzed the main imaging and demographic characteristics and reviewed neuroimaging for atypical presentations. RESULTS: One-hundred patients with confirmed ischemic CVA were included. Nineteen had positive polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. These patients had a lower prevalence of proximal arterial occlusion on imaging, higher in-hospital mortality, and worse baseline disability. No differences were identified in affected vascular territory, volume of infarction, initial CT stroke score, prevalence of hemorrhagic transformation, gender, age, cardiovascular risk factors, time to admission, symptom severity on entry, or decision to treat with thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Prevalence of COVID-19 in our code-stroke sample was higher than that for our province during this time period.

Comparison of the indirect contribution of quantitative easing (QE) to deficit financing with the direct contribution of seignorage implies that QE is a substitute to seignorage that preserves central bank dominance without much change in existing monetary institutions. Comparison of empirical evidence from the USA during the global financial crisis with the post-WWI German inflation supports the view that for countries experiencing deflationary pressure seignorage is more potent in moving inflation toward its target than QE.

METHODS: 115 patients undergoing colorectal resections were included in the final analysis. Before anastomotic formation, the bowel was extracted and the resection line was outlined and imaged using a compact HSI camera, in order to provide instantaneously quantitative perfusion assessment. RESULTS: In 105 patients, a clear demarcation line was visible with HSI one minute after marginal artery transection, reaching a plateau after 3 min. In 58 (55.2%) patients, the clinically determined transection line matched with HSI. In 23 (21.9%) patients, the clinically established resection margin was entirely within the less perfused area. In 24 patients (22.8%), the HSI transection line had an irregular course and crossed the clinically established resection line.

Despite of its apparent generality, a growing body of evidence shows that 'anomalous' LDG (i.e., inverse or hump-shaped trends) are common among marine organisms along the Southeastern Pacific (SEP) coast. Here, we evaluate the shape of the LDG of marine benthic polychaetes and its underlying causes using a dataset of 643 species inhabiting the continental shelf (<200 m depth), using latitudinal bands with a spatial resolution of 0.5, along the SEP (3-56 S). The explanatory value of six oceanographic (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), SST range, salinity, salinity range, primary productivity and shelf area), and one macroecological proxy (median latitudinal range of species) were assessed using a random forest model. The taxonomic structure was used to estimate the degree of niche conservatism of predictor variables and to estimate latitudinal trends in phylogenetic diversity, based on three indices (phylogenetic richness (PDSES), mean pairwise distance (MPDSES), and variation of pairwise distances (VPD)). The LDG exhibits a hump-shaped trend, with a maximum peak of species richness at ca. 42 S, declining towards northern and southern areas of SEP. The latitudinal pattern was also evident in local samples controlled by sampling effort. The random forest model had a high accuracy (pseudo-r2 = 0.95) and showed that the LDG could be explained by four variables (median latitudinal range, SST, salinity, and SST range), yet the functional relationship between species richness and these predictors was variable. A significant degree of phylogenetic conservatism was detected for the median latitudinal range and SST. PDSES increased toward the southern region, whereas VPD showed the opposite trend, both statistically significant. MPDSES has the same trend as PDSES, but it is not significant. Our results reinforce the idea that the south Chile fjord area, particularly the Chilo region, was likely the evolutionary source of new species of marine polychaetes along SEP, creating a hotspot of diversity. Therefore, in the same way as the canonical LDG shows a decline in diversity while moving away from the tropics; on this case the decline occurs while moving away from Chilo Island. These results, coupled with a strong phylogenetic signal of the main predictor variables suggest that processes operating mainly at evolutionary timescales govern the LDG.","output":"Evolutionary drivers of the hump-shaped latitudinal gradient of benthic polychaete species richness along the Southeastern Pacific coast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypercoagulation is a hallmark of both the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

However, the complex interplay between COVID-19, T2DM and its complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), and ALI creates a great challenge in the management of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old diabetic female with progressive pain in her left leg in the last five years, which was significantly intensified following COVID-19 diagnosis. Bluish coloration, numbness and functional impairments were observed during examinations with no palpable pulsation on left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient also had diabetic nephropathy (stage III), hypoalbuminemia, anemia and a urinary tract infection that complicated the management of the disease.

A random sample of 810 employees was drawn from social enterprises of Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although increasing research focuses on SE, the discipline continues to disintegrate, and this has led to appeals for a careful investigation of the associations of firms SE. In the recent decade, social entrepreneurship has earned its importance as a segment of entrepreneurship. Instead of mixed activity, firms are more likely to engage in either for-profit or non-profit activities. The causes for and consequences of this conduct has been mainly studied using objective measures of SEO, social performance, and financial performance, with little attention paid to the subjective experiences of social enterprises. We rely on the theory of stakeholder and mixed structuring to postulate that social performance intermediates the SEO-financial performance relation. By assessing a sample of 810 employees from active enterprises, we discover that social performance mediates positively and partially between SEO and financial performance, and both direct and indirect paths are in the same direction and significant. Our findings exhibit that social performance variance explained 74% of the mediating role, and the remaining 26% of the effect is because of SEO. We consider the functions by which an SEO influences enterprise performance and delivers more prominent understanding into multiple spectrums of performance. We discuss the prospective suggestions of our research and foster an encouraging pathway for more enquiry on the SEO paradigm. The study adds contribution to the literature, which has not been testified before on hybrid firms. SEO is a newly defined construct and requires more prospective research.

The sample involves a survey of 214 public health institutions in Ghana.FindingsBoth external and internal integration were found to have a significant positive effect on MCS information and, in turn, on the supply chain operational performance of public health institutions. Also, customer integration has a significant positive impact on the four dimensions with a corresponding impact on supply chain operational performance.Practical implicationsThe paper provides practitioners and policymakers with the usefulness of the contingency paradigm in enhancing the supply chain network of public health institutions during epidemics, hence, the need to adopt and develop the contingency approach in designing MCS within the public health sector. Effective public health management through a collaborative process between stakeholders (suppliers, customers and personnel) will mitigate stockouts of medical supplies and systematic disruptions in the public health supply chain.Originality/valueThe MCSs C supply chain integration interaction on organizational performance is one of the areas that has received very little attention in the literature particularly in service-oriented organizations.

Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the narrow administration window, current antiviral therapies are often inadequate. The efforts to use immunomodulatory agents alone or in combination with antiviral agents in the treatment of influenza in animal models have resulted in the achievement of protective effects accompanied with reduced cytokine production. Currently, there are no immunomodulatory drugs for influenza available for clinical use. Animal models, despite being ideal to study the anti-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast and economical screening methods using cell-based models to screen and develop novel immunomodulatory agents. In this study, we screened seven human cell lines and found that the human monocytic cell U937 supports the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses as well as the production of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines and was selected to develop the cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents and screening a drug library consisting of 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that the U937 cell model is robust and suitable for the high-throughput screening of immunomodulators and antivirals against influenza infection.

METHOD: Chest CT images of 66 patients (median age, 76 years; range, 29-94 years) who underwent the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were included in this retrospective study. The chest CT appearance was categorised as \\"typical,\\" \\"indeterminate,\\" \\"atypical,\\" or \\"negative\\" in accordance with the recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America for COVID-19 pneumonia and compared among the following four subgroups: PCR-positive outpatient (n = 14); PCR-positive hospitalised (n = 7); PCR-negative outpatient (n = 9); and PCR-negative hospitalised (n = 36). FINDINGS: The frequency of \\"typical\\" findings in the PCR-positive outpatient cases (13/14, 92.9%) was significantly higher than that of those in the PCR-positive hospitalised cases (2/7, 28.6%, P = 0.022).

Moreover, pre-existing CVDs are strong negative prognostic factors since they exacerbate the effects of the viral infection and lead to worse outcomes.

We carry out a large-scale study of 506,768 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We reveal that essentially all 100 most observed mutations strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants, L452R and E484Q found in India variants, can potentially disrupt the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies. Among these RBD mutations, L452R is also now known as part of the California variant B.1.427. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given, including S494P, Q493L, K417N, F490S, F486L, R403K, E484K, L452R, K417T, F490L, E484Q, and A475S. Mutation T478K appears to make the Mexico variant B.1.1.222 the most infectious one. Our comprehensive genetic analysis and protein-protein binding study show that the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on the RBD, which may be regulated by host gene editing, viral proofreading, random genetic drift, and natural selection, gives rise to more infectious variants that will potentially compromise existing vaccines and antibody therapies.","output":"Vaccine-escape and fast-growing mutations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, Spain, India, and other COVID-19-devastated countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the recommended initial treatment for secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR), however, supported by only little comprehensive evidence. This study, therefore, sought to assess the effect of GDMT titration on SMR and to identify specific substance combinations able to reduce SMR severity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 261 patients who completed two visits with an echocardiographic exam available within 1 month at each visit. After comprehensively defining GDMT titration as well as SMR reduction, logistic regression analysis was applied in order to assess the effects of overall GDMT titration and specific substance combinations on SMR severity. SMR severity improved by at least 1 in 39.3% of patients with subsequent titration of GDMT and was accompanied by reverse remodelling and clinical improvement. The effects of GDMT titration were significantly associated with SMR reduction (adj. odds ratio 2.91, 95% confidence interval 1.34-6.32, P = 0.007). Moreover, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) as well as the combined dosage effects of (i) renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRA), (ii) beta-blockers (BB) and MRA, as well as (iii) RASi, BB, and MRA were all significantly associated with SMR improvement (P < 0.044 for all). CONCLUSION: The present study provides comprehensive evidence for the effectiveness of contemporary GDMT to specifically improve SMR. Our data indicate that GDMT titration conveys a three-fold increased chance of reducing SMR severity. Moreover, the dosage effects of ARNi, as well as the combination of RASi and MRA, BB and MRA, and all three substances in the aggregate are able to significantly improve SMR.","output":"Guideline directed medical therapy and reduction of secondary mitral regurgitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a recently described technique for expanding of human T lymphocyte populations from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we investigated the local cellular immune response in a patient with chronic rubella panencephalitis.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the rapid development and evaluation of clinical algorithms to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization using patient data by citizen scientists, provide an unbiased assessment of model performance, and benchmark model performance on subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic and prognostic study operated a continuous, crowdsourced challenge using a model-to-data approach to securely enable the use of regularly updated COVID-19 patient data from the University of Washington by participants from May 6 to December 23, 2020. A postchallenge analysis was conducted from December 24, 2020, to April 7, 2021, to assess the generalizability of models on the cumulative data set as well as subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, and time of COVID-19 test. By December 23, 2020, this challenge engaged 482 participants from 90 teams and 7 countries. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Machine learning algorithms used patient data and output a score that represented the probability of patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test result or being hospitalized within 21 days after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result. Algorithms were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) scores. Ensemble models aggregating models from the top challenge teams were developed and evaluated. RESULTS: In the analysis using the cumulative data set, the best performance for COVID-19 diagnosis prediction was an AUROC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.775-0.777) and an AUPRC of 0.297, and for hospitalization prediction, an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.794-0.798) and an AUPRC of 0.188.

Following MHV-3 infection, macrophages isolated from MHV-3-susceptible and -semisusceptible inbred strains of mice express increased procoagulant activity (PCA), whereas macrophages from resistant strains express no increase in PCA over basal levels. The PCA induced by MHV-3 is a prothrombinase, encoded by the gene Fgl-2, which encodes a fibrinogen-like protein (musfiblp). In this study, MHV-3-resistant A/J mice treated with methylprednisolone prior to infection with MHV-3 developed elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase in serum and died within 10 days of infection, with histological findings of fulminant hepatitis. In vitro, macrophages isolated from A/J mice and pretreated with methylprednisolone produced a marked increase in functional PCA following infection with MHV-3. The PCA was shown to be a prothrombinase by its ability to cleave 125I-prothrombin. Northern blot analysis of RNA transcripts from these macrophages demonstrated increased transcription of the Fgl-2 gene relative to that in macrophages which had not been pretreated with methylprednisolone prior to MHV-3 infection. Methylprednisolone pretreatment of MHV-3-infected macrophages stabilized the Fgl-2 mRNA. Thus, loss of resistance to MHV-3 secondary to methylprednisolone therapy is associated with increased transcription and stability of Fgl-2 mRNA resulting in expression of the Fgl-2 gene product, musfiblp.

The National Diabetes Prevention Programs Lifestyle Change Program (DPP LCP) has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of progressing from prediabetes to T2DM. However, most individuals who could benefit from the program do not enroll. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial is to test the real-world efficacy of 3 mobile phoneCbased approaches to increasing enrollment in the DPP LCP including a best-practice condition and 2 novel approaches. METHODS: We will conduct a 3-armed randomized clinical trial comparing enrollment and 1-month engagement in the DPP LCP among adults with prediabetes from 2 health care settings. Participants in the best-practice condition will receive SMS-based notifications that they have prediabetes and a link to a website that explains prediabetes, T2DM, and the DPP LCP. This will be followed by a single question survey, Would you like the DPP LCP to call you to enroll? Participants in the 2 intervention arms will receive the same best-practice intervention plus either 2 mobile 360 videos or up to 5 brief phone calls from a health coach trained in a motivational coaching approach known as Motivation and Problem Solving (MAPS). We will collect measures of diabetes-related knowledge, beliefs in the controllability of risk for T2DM, risk perceptions for T2DM, and self-efficacy for lifestyle change pre-intervention and 4 weeks later. The primary outcomes of the study are enrollment in the DPP LCP and 4-week engagement in the DPP LCP. In addition, data on the person-hours needed to deliver the interventions as well as participant feedback about the interventions and their acceptability will be collected. Our primary hypotheses are that the 2 novel interventions will lead to higher enrollment and engagement in the DPP LCP than the best-practice intervention. Secondary hypotheses concern the mechanisms of action of the 2 intervention arms: (1) whether changes in risk perception are associated with program enrollment among participants in the mobile 360 video group and (2) whether changes in self-efficacy for lifestyle change are associated with program enrollment among participants in the MAPS coaching group. Finally, exploratory analyses will examine the cost effectiveness and acceptability of the interventions. RESULTS: The project was funded in September 2020; enrollment began in February 2021 and is expected to continue through July 2022. CONCLUSIONS: We are conducting a test of 2 novel, scalable, mobile phoneCbased interventions to increase enrollment in the DPP LCP. If effective, they have tremendous potential to be scaled up to help prevent T2DM nationwide.

Neurodevelopment was assessed at 30 months adjusted using the Bayley-III. ROC and linear regression were used to evaluate the relationship between CSO, CMAP, and BPD with WMI and neurodevelopmental performance, respectively. RESULTS Of the 87 infants, 30 (34.5%) had moderate-severe BPD, which was associated with WMI (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.1-34.9, p = 0.012). CSO and CMAP predicted WMI as well as BPD (AUC 0.68-0.77).

Carbapenems are among the most potent antimicrobial agents that are commercially available to treat MDR bacteria. Bacterial production of carbapenem-hydrolysing metallo--lactamases (MBLs) challenges their safety and efficacy, with subclass B1 MBLs hydrolysing almost all -lactam antibiotics. MBL inhibitors would fulfil an urgent clinical need by prolonging the lifetime of these life-saving drugs. Here we report the synthesis and activity of a series of 2-mercaptomethyl-thiazolidines (MMTZs), designed to replicate MBL interactions with reaction intermediates or hydrolysis products. MMTZs are potent competitive inhibitors of B1 MBLs in vitro (e.g., K(i) = 0.44 M vs. NDM-1). Crystal structures of MMTZ complexes reveal similar binding patterns to the most clinically important B1 MBLs (NDM-1, VIM-2 and IMP-1), contrasting with previously studied thiol-based MBL inhibitors, such as bisthiazolidines (BTZs) or captopril stereoisomers, which exhibit lower, more variable potencies and multiple binding modes. MMTZ binding involves thiol coordination to the Zn(ii) site and extensive hydrophobic interactions, burying the inhibitor more deeply within the active site than d/l-captopril. Unexpectedly, MMTZ binding features a thioetherC interaction with a conserved active-site aromatic residue, consistent with their equipotent inhibition and similar binding to multiple MBLs. MMTZs penetrate multiple Enterobacterales, inhibit NDM-1 in situ, and restore carbapenem potency against clinical isolates expressing B1 MBLs. Based on their inhibitory profile and lack of eukaryotic cell toxicity, MMTZs represent a promising scaffold for MBL inhibitor development. These results also suggest sulphurC interactions can be exploited for general ligand design in medicinal chemistry.","output":"2-Mercaptomethyl-thiazolidines use conserved aromaticCS interactions to achieve broad-range inhibition of metallo--lactamases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite aggression being detrimental to children's physical health, mental health, and social development, the dispositional and neurological antecedents of aggression in the child are poorly understood.

The present results showed that trait aggression was negatively correlated with agreeableness and positively correlated with neuroticism. The brain analyses showed that children with a higher propensity for aggression had a lower fALFF mainly in the left superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus. Physical and total aggression were negatively associated with rsFC between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right putamen. Further analysis revealed that this rsFC could moderate the influence of neuroticism on total aggression. Moreover, the results suggest the presence of a sex difference in the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying aggression in middle childhood.

Therefore, this study sought to explore changes in RBCs in the peripheral blood of HFRS patients. We isolated PBMCs from HFRS patients and performed single-cell RNA sequencing.

In addition, it was shown that the higher the count of NRBC in peripheral blood, the more severe the disease status was.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the change in children's and adolescents' prevention and vaccination behaviors amid China's COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in mid-March 2020 using proportional quota sampling in Wuhan (the epidemic epicenter) and Shanghai (a nonepicenter). Data were collected from 1655 parents with children aged 3 to 17 years. Children's and adolescents' prevention behaviors and regular vaccination behaviors before and during the epidemic were assessed. Descriptive analyses were used to investigate respondents' characteristics, public health prevention behaviors, unproven protection behaviors, and vaccination behaviors before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. Univariate analyses were performed to compare differences in outcome measures between cities and family characteristics, using chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests (if expected frequency was <5) and analyses of variance. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the factors and disparities associated with prevention and vaccination behaviors. RESULTS: Parent-reported prevention behaviors increased among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic compared with those before the epidemic. During the epidemic, 82.2% (638/776) of children or adolescents always wore masks when going out compared with 31.5% (521/1655) before the epidemic; in addition, 25.0% (414/1655) and 79.8% (1321/1655) had increased their frequency and duration of handwashing, respectively, although only 46.9% (776/1655) went out during the epidemic. Meanwhile, 56.1% (928/1655) of the families took unproven remedies against COVID-19. Parent-reported vaccination behaviors showed mixed results, with 74.8% (468/626) delaying scheduled vaccinations and 80.9% (1339/1655) planning to have their children get the influenza vaccination after the epidemic. Regarding socioeconomic status, children and adolescents from larger families and whose parents had lower education levels were less likely to improve prevention behaviors but more likely to take unproven remedies. Girls were less likely than boys to always wear a mask when going out and wash their hands. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention behaviors and attitudes toward influenza vaccination have improved during the COVID-19 epidemic. Public health prevention measures should be continuously promoted, particularly among girls, parents with lower education levels, and larger families. Meanwhile, misinformation about COVID-19 remains a serious challenge and needs to be addressed by public health stakeholders.","output":"The Influence of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Prevention and Vaccination Behaviors Among Chinese Children and Adolescents: Cross-sectional Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed nearly one million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 C and 37 C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating COVID-19, and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks. HIGHLIGHTS Focused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses. Focused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genome-wide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter. Parallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles. The number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the number of functional interactors.

RECENT FINDINGS The incidence of appendiceal endometriosis is highly variable depending on the patient population selected. Although rare in patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis, women with endometriosis may experience rates as high as 9.3-39.0%, especially when suffering from deep infiltrative endometriosis. Appendectomy may also significantly reduce pain in women with unexplained chronic pelvic pain.

Here, we show that - unlike constitutive Nr5a2+/- mice - conditional Nr5a2 heterozygosity in pancreatic epithelial cells, combined with mutant Kras, (KPN+/- ) leads to a dramatic replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma with cystic structures and an accelerated development of high grade PanINs and PDAC. Timed histopathological analyses indicated that in KPN+/- mice PanINs precede the formation of cystic lesions and the latter precede PDAC. A single episode of acute caerulein pancreatitis is sufficient to accelerate the development of cystic lesions in KPN+/- mice. Epithelial cells of cystic lesions of KPN+/- mice express MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6 but lack expression of MUC2, CDX2 and acinar markers, indicative of a pancreato-biliary/gastric phenotype. In accordance with this, in human samples we found a non-significantly decreased expression of NR5A2 in mucinous tumours, compared with conventional PDAC.

Our findings illustrate likely complexities in future COVID-19 dynamics and highlight the importance of immunological characterization beyond the measurement of active infections for adequately projecting the immune landscape generated by SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Immune life history, vaccination, and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 over the next 5 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe 4 people with HIV (PWH) who acquired acute hepatitis A (HAV) infection during recent King County, Washington, outbreaks despite documented immunity and/or vaccination.

However, most data from the region are old and do not provide information on the causative Echinococcus species. For Namibian livestock only anecdotal records were available prior to this preliminary survey. Our retrospective analysis of slaughterhouse records of CE in cattle from the commercial farming area in central and southern Namibia resulted in 1.65% CE prevalence among 35,143 slaughtered cattle in the period 2015-2016. For comparison, carcasses of ruminant livestock were prospectively examined in the communal farming areas of northern Namibia, resulting in three CE cases among only 12 cattle, and no cases among nine goats. To determine the Echinococcus species affecting Namibian livestock, a total of 53 cysts were collected from all parts of the country and analysed for species and genotype by amplification and sequencing of the nad1 gene. All 50 cattle cysts (isolated from 40 cattle), both from the commercial and communal farming areas, were Echinococcus ortleppi (all fertile, and 42/50 from the lungs), while three opportunistically collected cysts from three sheep in southern Namibia were E. canadensis G7. Our data suggest that E. ortleppi is the only CE agent that is relevant for cattle infection in Namibia, and that low prevalence in the commercial farming areas contrasts with high CE burden in the northern traditional husbandry systems. The present data provide baseline information to stimulate epidemiological studies on the transmission pathways of various CE agents in livestock, wildlife, and humans in Namibia and neighbouring countries.","output":"Cystic echinococcosis of ruminant livestock in Namibia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New Year's Eve 2020, Wuhan outbreak of new crown pneumonia and spread nationwide.

During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals' adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups. A sample of 1000 adults aged &#8805;18 years who are representative of the population of the United States by gender, race and ethnicity, and age will be randomly assigned (via a 1:1 allocation) to an intervention or a placebo-control arm. The intervention will be a digital infographic with content based on principles of trust in science, developed by a health communications expert. The intervention will then be both pretested and pilot-tested to determine its viability. Study outcomes will include trust in science, a COVID-19 narrative belief latent profile membership, and the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors, which will be controlled by 8 theoretically selected covariates. RESULTS: This study was funded in August 2020, approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board on September 15, 2020, and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 misinformation prophylaxis is crucial. This proposed experiment investigates the impact of a brief yet actionable intervention that can be easily disseminated to increase individuals' trust in science, with the intention of affecting misinformation believability and, consequently, preventive behavioral intentions.

The aim of this study was to report the first clinical multicenter experience with the new Scepter Mini dual-lumen microballoon catheter. METHODS Patients with cerebral or spinal vascular malformations treated with the Scepter Mini at seven European neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, angiographic features of the vascular malformations, procedural parameters including the type of application, navigability, technical failures, complications and embolization success were assessed. RESULTS The usage of 34 Scepter Mini microballoon catheters in 20 patients was analyzed. Most treated malformations (80.0%) were cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Four different applications were reported: embolization via Scepter Mini (n=23, 67.6%), balloon-occlusion with simultaneous embolization via a second microcatheter (n=3, 8.8%), diagnostic angiography with simultaneous balloon-inflation for flow arrest (n=4, 11.8%), and navigation support (n=4, 11.8%). The mean diameter of the blood vessels in which the Scepter Mini was inflated was 1.90.5 mm. The navigability of the Scepter Mini was rated as 'easy' or 'very easy' in 88.2% of cases. Complete occlusion of the malformation was achieved in 60.9% of cases. Technical failures occurred in 4/23 embolization procedures, and all were related to insufficient stability of the balloon within the vessel. No complications related to the Scepter Mini were observed, while unrelated complications occurred in three patients (15.0%). CONCLUSIONS The Scepter Mini is a promising new device for balloon-assisted embolization of cerebrospinal vascular malformations via small feeders. Beyond embolization, the Scepter Mini can also be used for other applications, such as superselective flow arrest and navigation support.","output":"First clinical multicenter experience with the new Scepter Mini microballoon catheter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The successful conservation and restoration of the temperate native grasslands of south\\\\eastern Australia is critical to reversing the decline in range and diversity of these threatened plant communities. Yet the goals of high native species diversity and weed management are difficult to achieve in grassland restoration projects. To increase our understanding of whether synergies exist between these goals (i.e. whether early introduction of a larger number of species might improve both outcomes in the reassembly of native grassland), we examined the relationships between plant species number, functional group number and resource use during the establishment phase of direct\\\\sown grassland. We did this by sowing a representative suite of species (at varying levels of species number and functional group number) into experimental plots and then measuring and analysing the extent to which the newly established assemblages captured available resources, i.e. used soil nitrate, absorbed light and produced biomass (vegetative cover). Statistically significant correlations were common between the predictor variables (species number, functional group number, percentage vegetative cover, plant number, presence of idiosyncratic (dominating) species) and responses (soil nitrate concentration, light reduction or extinction). Higher diversity was associated with lower soil nitrate, while percentage vegetative cover and the presence of idiosyncratic species best predicted light extinction. The relationship between diversity, and plant biomass (measured as vegetative cover) and plant number was positive in the first year of the study. The diversity/biomass relationship became negative in the second year due to the higher numbers and cover of idiosyncratic species. The diversity/plant number relationship also became negative in the autumn of the second year and was reduced to a trend by the winter. We found that lower nitrate and increasing plant numbers and vegetative cover were most strongly linked to increasing species number in the early stages of this study. This suggests that introducing and maintaining high diversity early in a native grassland reassembly or enhancement project will improve the resistance (e.g. to weed) of these communities. At later stages of grassland development, this function may be provided by the more dominating idiosyncratic species. The maintenance of diversity, an important goal in its own right, will therefore necessitate managed disturbances to periodically reduce the vegetative dominance of idiosyncratic species, releasing resources for the diverse range of other species whose early introduction will have allowed them to persist in the soil seed bank or as suppressed rootstocks.","output":"Does diversity influence soil nitrate, light availability and productivity in the establishment phase of Australian temperate grassland reconstruction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Parents of seriously ill children worry about their vulnerable child contracting COVID-19, whether their child's palliative care providers will be able to continue to provide the same quality of care to their child, and who can be with the child to provide comfort. For providers, shifts in healthcare provision, communication formats, and support offerings for families facing distress or loss during the pandemic may promote providers' moral distress. This study aimed to define the ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted end-of-life care and approach to bereavement care in pediatric palliative care (PPC). METHOD: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments and Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus (PANDEMIC) survey was developed to learn about the PPC experience during COVID-19 in the United States. The survey was posted with permission on seven nationally focused Listservs. RESULTS: A total of 207 PPC team members from 80 cities within 39 states and the District of Columbia participated. In the majority of hospitals, admitted pediatric patients were only allowed one parent as a visitor with the exception of both parents or nuclear family at end of life. Creative alternatives to grief support and traditional funeral services were described. The high incidence of respondents' depicted moral distress was often focused on an inability to provide a desired level of care due to existing rules and policies and bearing witness to patient and family suffering enhanced by the pandemic. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the provision of end-of-life care and bereavement for children, family caregivers, and PPC providers. Our results identify tangible limitations of restricted personal contact and the pain of watching families stumble through a stunted grieving process.

We aim to investigate the impact of the pandemic on psychiatric services and the severity of presentations in Edinburgh, with a particular focus on the North-West Edinburgh Community Mental Health Team (NW CMHT).MethodMeasures of the impact of the pandemic on NW CMHT were identified as referral numbers from primary care and Did Not Attend (DNA) rates. Royal Edinburgh Hospital admissions, detentions under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (MHA) and Out of Hours (OOH) contacts were used as proxy measures to explore the severity and urgency of presentations.Quantitative data focussing on these parameters for patients aged 18C65 years in NW CMHT in 2019 and 2020 were collected from NHS Lothian Analytical Services. OOH data were only available Edinburgh-wide. All data were anonymised in line with NHS Lothian Information Governance Policy.In order to assess the impact on staff, a questionnaire was created and disseminated, with qualitative data returned anonymously.ResultReferrals to NW CMHT decreased by 9.3% in 2020 (n = 2164) compared to 2019 (n = 2366). Referrals in April (n = 81) and May (n = 102) 2020 were far below the monthly average across the two years (n = 188).Appointment numbers were very similar in 2019 (n = 3542) and 2020 (n = 3514). Despite this, DNA and cancellation rates decreased by 3.94% in 2020. Questionnaire results illustrated some of the challenges for staff of working during a pandemic.Admissions to hospital reduced by 6.8% in 2020 (n = 219 vs n = 235). While MHA detentions in NW Edinburgh increased by only 1.8% (n = 173 vs n = 170), new Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTO) increased by 60%. Furthermore, OOH contacts across Edinburgh increased by 45.2% when compared to 2019.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic altered the way patients accessed healthcare. Uncertainty of the public in accessing primary care services early in the pandemic may have contributed to reduced referral numbers.The increase in CTOs is suggestive of severe relapses in previously stable patients or new episodes of illness. The pandemic may have contributed to a reduction in early recognition, and referral, of those with major mental disorders resulting in more protracted or severe illness episodes. The increase in OOH crisis contacts supports such a hypothesis.Despite what would be expected, DNA and cancellation rates in NW CMHT reduced. The contribution of telemedicine to this warrants further exploration as a means of delivering healthcare in an efficient and accessible way.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric services and presentations in north-west Edinburgh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare Workers (HCW) are repeatedly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to predict the actual impact on virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to understand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models capable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in relation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios. The model uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus (based on a virus spread risk model) and population mobility patterns. The model is calibrated with real data and reproduces the impact that different mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would have been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on a-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic.

Therefore, this research is designed under two different studies: (A) Study 1: Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on students' psychological symptoms and (B) Study 2: Views and expectations of students and school counselors about school counseling services. The first study was a quantitative study and included 549 high school students (398 female, 151 male). A structural equation model (SEM) was created to examine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on participants' psychological symptoms. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores showed that 107 (19.50%) individuals had a score of 50 and above pointing out that individuals in this group had severe impact of event/trauma symptomologies. The SEM analysis indicated that IES-R scores had a total effect of 0.79 on anxiety, 0.75 on depression, 0.74 on negative self-concept, 0.68 on somatization, and 0.66 on hostility scores. Furthermore, female students had significantly higher scores on anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, somatization, hostility, and impact of events variables than male students. Study 2 was a qualitative design and consisted of five school counselors and five students from different schools. The results indicated that students' difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak were educational, cognitive, emotional, physiological, relational, technological, and related to routines.

Devise strategies to improve collaborations with long-term care providers in their own communities It is estimated that the majority of people receiving long-term care services have unmet palliative care needs, and for those near the end of life, hospice care remains underused. These disparities were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now many long-term care programs and facilities are eager to address the palliative care needs of their patients or residents and avoid unnecessary hospital transfers, but they need to understand this in a way that aligns with their own priorities and operations. Two recent initiatives have provided education, resources, and peer learning to groups of long-term care providers, to expedite the integration of palliative care in long-term care settings. One learning collaborative was led by a local health system aiming to improve outcomes for patients in their community, and one was led by a national organization to improve end-of-life experiences in Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) nationwide. Common to both efforts was targeted education, focused on proactively identifying people in need of palliative care and how to incorporate this identification into existing workflows; holding effective goals of care and advance care planning conversations; managing physical and psychosocial symptoms; and facilitating referral to palliative care specialty teams or hospice, as appropriate.

Kata Kunci: COVID-19;Analisis;Pencegahan;Rutan;SWOT At the end of 2019, a new Coronavirus variant was found in the city of Wuhan, China, which was named the SARS-CoV-2 Virus or known as COVID-19. COVID-19 attacks the respiratory system in humans, which spreads between humans in various countries, including Indonesia. Various policies have been issued to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but every day there are still additional positive cases of COVID-19. One of them is the policy to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the Class IIB Kudus State Detention Center. This study aims to conduct a Strategic Environmental Analysis of the Prevention of the Spread of COVID-19 in the Class IIB Kudus State Detention Center so that effective efforts are known in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The type of research is mixed method research in the form of quantitative data used to perform Swot analysis, qualitative data and the result of an interview, so that it can describe the results of the analysis. The result shows that the efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by the Kudus Class IIB Rutan showed an aggressive strategy located in quadrant I, so that the Kudus Class IIB Rutan can maintain existing methods and add new methods as a form of innovation. The result of this study also finds the fact that the efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 carried out by the Class IIB Kudus State Detention Center are very effective to minimize the positive number of COVID-19.

There is concern about the use of anti-CD20-depleting monoclonal antibodies, due to the apparent increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition of protective anti-COVID-19 vaccine responses. These antibodies are given as maintenance infusions/injections and cause persistent depletion of CD20+ B cells, notably memory B cell populations that may be instrumental in the control of relapsing MS. However, they also continuously deplete immature and mature/na?ve B cells that form the precursors for infection-protective antibody responses, thus blunting vaccine responses. Seroconversion and maintained SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels provide protection from COVID-19. However, it is evident that poor-seroconversion occurs in the majority of individuals following initial and booster COVID-19 vaccinations, based on standard 6-monthly dosing intervals. Seroconversion may be optimized in the anti-CD20-treated population by vaccinating prior to treatment-onset or using extended/delayed interval dosing (3-6 month extension to dosing interval) in those established on therapy, with B cell monitoring until (1-3%) B cell repopulation occurs prior to vaccination. Some people will take more than a year to replete and therefore protection may depend on either the vaccine-induced T cell responses that typically occur or may require prophylactic, or rapid post-infection therapeutic, antibody or small molecule anti-viral treatment to optimise protection against COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such approaches and whether or not immunity wanes prematurely as has been observed in the other populations.","output":"Seroconversion following COVID-19 vaccination: Can we optimize protective response in CD20-treated individuals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes 40 years of maternal and newborn outcomes at an award-winning hospital in the Ladakh region of India from the perspectives of a medical anthropologist, obstetrician, and pediatrician.

Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are rising, and more women are seeking mastectomy as treatment and as prophylaxis. Methods: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction often begins at the time of mastectomy in coordination with the oncologic breast surgeons. Immediate breast reconstruction increases complication rate (11% vs 4%) and unplanned reoperation rate (7% vs 4%), requiring more personnel and resources used during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of patient care. Discussion: In the setting of global pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), breast reconstruction demands a unique and nuanced approach, as most forms of breast reconstruction can occur successfully in a delayed fashion. While this may prolong the overall time until completion of reconstruction, other factors come into play in the setting of a communicable (potentially deadly) illness. Factors that must be considered include allocation of essential resources and protection of patients and families from disease transmission. Conclusions: Plastic surgeons performing breast reconstruction must take these factors into account when counseling their patients, colleagues, and institutions and be proactive in determining which procedures are time-critical and which should be postponed until the disaster situation has relieved.","output":"Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction in the Time of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite health benefits, sustained breastfeeding rates remain low in the United States, and the role of partners in breastfeeding is not well understood.

Previous studies have shown that comorbidity can impact on the short-term and long-term mortality after stroke. METHODS: Our study aimed to explore the trend of comorbidity among patients with first stroke from 2010 to 2020, and the influence of comorbidity on admission mortality, length of stay and hospitalization costs. 5988 eligible patients were enrolled in our study, and divided into 4 comorbidity burden groups according to Charlson comorbidity index (CCI): none, moderate, severe, very severe. Survival analysis was expressed by KaplanCMeier curve. Cox regression model was used to analyze the effect of comorbidity on 7-day and in-hospital mortality. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the association between comorbidity and hospitalization days and cost. RESULTS: Compared to patients without comorbidity, those with very severe comorbidity were more likely to be male (342, 57.7%), suffer from ischemic stroke (565, 95.3%), afford higher expense (Midian, 19339.3RMB, IQR13020.7C27485.9RMB), and have a higher in-hospital mortality (60, 10.1%). From 2010 to 2020, proportion of patients with severe and very severe comorbidity increased 12.9%. The heaviest comorbidity burden increased the risk of 7-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.51, 95% CI 2.22C5.53) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.83, 95% CI 2.70C5.45). Patients with very severe comorbidity had a 12% longer LOS and extra 27% expense than those without comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity burden showed an increasing trend year in past eleven years. The heavy comorbidity burden increased in-hospital mortality, LOS, and hospitalization cost, especially in patients aged 55 years or more.

Institutions of higher education are heterogeneous work units that supported continued in-person employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a test site for occupational health evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between self-reported protective behaviors and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among essential in-person employees during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 13 to September 2, 2020, at an institution of higher education in Fort Collins, Colorado. Employees 18 years or older without symptoms of COVID-19 who identified as essential in-person workers during the first 6 months of the pandemic were included. Participants completed a survey, and blood and nasal swab samples were collected to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection via quantitative reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and past infection by serologic testing. EXPOSURE: Self-reported practice of protective behaviors against COVID-19 according to public health guidelines provided to employees. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of current SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by qRT-PCR or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by an IgG SARS-CoV-2 testing platform. The frequency of protective behavior practices and essential workers concerns regarding contracting COVID-19 and exposing others were measured based on survey responses. RESULTS: Among 508 participants (305 [60.0%] women, 451 [88.8%] non-Hispanic White individuals; mean [SD] age, 41.1 [12.5] years), there were no qRT-PCR positive test results, and only 2 participants (0.4%) had seroreactive IgG antibodies. Handwashing and mask wearing were reported frequently both at work (480 [94.7%] and 496 [97.8%] participants, respectively) and outside work (465 [91.5%] and 481 [94.7%] participants, respectively). Social distancing was reported less frequently at work (403 [79.5%]) than outside work (465 [91.5%]) (P < .001). Participants were more highly motivated to avoid exposures because of concern about spreading the infection to others (419 [83.0%]) than for personal protection (319 [63.2%]) (P < .001).

High income countries (HIC) seemingly account for the majority of the mortalities considering that these countries have screened more persons. Low middle income countries (LMIC) countries may experience far worse mortalities considering the existence of a weaker health care system and the several underlying population level morbidities. As a result, it becomes imperative to understand the ecological correlation between critical underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Method: This is an ecological study using data on COVID-19 cases, prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, adult HIV prevalence, quality of air and life expectancy. We plotted a histogram, performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and used spearman correlation to assess the degree of correlation between COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and other covariates mentioned above. Result: As at the 31st of March 2020, there were a total of 846,281 cases of COVID-19 from 204 countries and a global case fatality rate of 5% (range 0% to 29%). Angola and Sudan both had the highest CFR of 29%, while Italy had the highest number of deaths (i.e. 12,428) as at 31st of March 2020. Adult HIV prevalence has a significant but weak negative correlation with CFR (correlation coefficient = - 0.24, p value =0.01) while all the other variables have positive correlation with CFR due to COVID-19 though not statistically significant. Of the 204 countries analyzed, only 11 countries (i.e. 5%) had complete datasets across all 5 population level morbidities (i.e. prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy, quality of air, and adult HIV prevalence variables). Correlations of CFR from these 11 countries were similar to that from the 204 countries except for the correlation with quality of air and prevalence of tobacco use. Conclusion: While we interpret our data with caution given the fact that this is an ecological study, our findings suggest that population level factors such as prevalence of COPD, prevalence of tobacco use, life expectancy and quality of air are positively correlated with CFR from COVID-19 but, adult HIV prevalence has a weak and negative correlation with COVID-19 CFR and would require extensive research.","output":"Ecologic correlation between underlying population level morbidities and COVID-19 case fatality rate among countries infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower respiratory tract infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality.

(3) Results: The results revealed that PDCoV entry was not affected after treatment with chlorpromazine (CPZ), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA)or ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), indicating that the entry of PDCoV into PK-15 cells were clathrin-, micropinocytosis-, PH-independent endocytosis. Conversely, PDCoV infection was sensitive to nystatin, dynasore and methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) with reduced PDCoV internalization, indicating that entry of PDCoV into PK-15 cells was caveolae-mediated endocytosis that required dynamin and cholesterol; indirect immunofluorescence and shRNA interference further validated these results.

Secondary efficacy outcomes included the response rate, defined as at least a 50% improvement in MADRS, Clinical Global Impressions severity and improvement subscales, and patient-reported measures of depression and cognitive function. Eighty-five patients completed the randomized treatment phases. Treatment groups did not differ in mean change in MADRS scores, response rate, or in any secondary efficacy outcomes. Riluzole was generally well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with its clinical use. In conclusion, a fixed dose of riluzole (100 mg/day) did not show adjunctive antidepressant efficacy compared to placebo.

The number of samples is 95 MSMEs members registered at the Department of Coopera tive and Micro Enterprise, Magetan Regency, Indonesia. The data were analyzed by the multiple linear regression analysis techniques. The analysis result shows that during the Covid-19 pandemic, tax moral function was neglected in increasing tax compliance. The focus of MSMEs owners is trying to maintain thei r b usi ness t o su rvive while their tax obligations are the next priority. The considerations as thei r b asi s t o carry o ut t h ei r t ax obligation are sanction and tax relaxation. The sanction plays a strong role in increasin g t a x co mpl ia nce which means the tax compliance of MSMEs owners is in compliance due t o co erci on. Ta x rel axat ion i s another option as a solution to increase the taxpayer's compliance with MSMEs owners during the pandemic. It gives ease and relief for MSMEs owners to fulfill their tax obligations. ? 2021, Pro Global Science Association.

Interpersonal contact patterns play a large role in infectious disease spread, but little is known about the relationship between health care workers (HCW) movements and contact patterns within a heath care facility and HAI. Quantitatively capturing these patterns will aid in understanding the dynamics of HAI and may lead to more targeted and effective control strategies in the hospital setting. METHODS: Staff at 3 urban university-based tertiary care hospitals in Canada completed a detailed questionnaire on demographics, interpersonal contacts, in-hospital movement, and infection prevention and control practices. Staff were divided into categories of administrative/support, nurses, physicians, and Other HCWs - a fourth distinct category, which excludes physicians and nurses. Using quantitative network modeling tools, we constructed the resulting HCW co-location network to illustrate contacts among different occupations and with locations in hospital settings. RESULTS: Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. Other HCWs had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than one-strategy-fits-all HAI prevention and control programs.

Although the initial step of CHIKV adaptation to A. albopictus was determined to involve an A226V amino acid substitution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein that first arose in 2005, little attention has been paid to subsequent CHIKV evolution after this adaptive mutation was convergently selected in several geographic locations. To determine whether selection of second-step adaptive mutations in CHIKV or other arthropod-borne viruses occurs in nature, we tested the effect of an additional envelope glycoprotein amino acid change identified in Kerala, India in 2009. This substitution, E2-L210Q, caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus, but had no effect on CHIKV fitness in the alternative mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or in vertebrate cell lines. Using infectious viruses or virus-like replicon particles expressing the E2-210Q and E2-210L residues, we determined that E2-L210Q acts primarily at the level of infection of A. albopictus midgut epithelial cells. In addition, we observed that the initial adaptive substitution, E1-A226V, had a significantly stronger effect on CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus than E2-L210Q, thus explaining the observed time differences required for selective sweeps of these mutations in nature. These results indicate that the continuous CHIKV circulation in an A. albopictus-human cycle since 2005 has resulted in the selection of an additional, second-step mutation that may facilitate even more efficient virus circulation and persistence in endemic areas, further increasing the risk of more severe and expanded CHIK epidemics.","output":"Sequential Adaptive Mutations Enhance Efficient Vector Switching by Chikungunya Virus and Its Epidemic Emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During the past months, the Italian Government has reduced the restrictions and access to hospitals. Since then, up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergencies have had unusual delayed treatment.

METHODS: Between February 2020 and December 2020, all patients older than 68 years old undergone appendectomy were included. Surgical approach, hospital stay, post-operative complications, radiology reports, and histologic examination were included in the retrospective analysis and compared with a same sample of the same period before the pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent appendectomy for acute appendicitis during the pandemic and 34 patients in the pre-outbreak period. Laparoscopic approach was completed in 51.8% of the cases, while conversion to laparotomy in 22.3% of patients and open procedure in the 25.9%, before the pandemic 73.6%, 14.7%, and 11.7%, respectively.

We tested residual donor plasma minipools (MPs) to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia prevalence in six United States areas. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS Blood donations collected from 7 March 2020 to 25 September 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (vRNA) in MP of 6 or 16 donations using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 research-use only (RUO) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay. Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture.

Furthermore, we observed that TRAF6 overexpression significantly inhibited CSFV replication, and TRAF6 knockdown promoted CSFV replication in porcine alveolar macrophages. Additionally, TRAF6 was degraded during CSFV infection or NS3 expression exclusively, indicating that CSFV and TRAF6 were mutually antagonistic and that TRAF6 degradation might contribute to persistent CSFV replication. Moreover, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activity and interferon (IFN)- and interleukin (IL)-6 expression were increased in TRAF6-overexpressing cells, whereas TRAF6-knockdown cells exhibited decreased NF-B activity and IFN- and IL-6 levels. Notably, TRAF6 overexpression did not reduce CSFV replication following inhibition of NF-B activation by p65 knockdown.

The fact that the obtained IC50 values for the inhibitors are in good accordance with the discovered dissociation equilibrium constants (KDs) assayed by SPR implied the reliability of this platform. Our current work is hoped to supply a powerful approach in the discovery of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, and the determined inhibitors could be used as possible lead compounds for further research.","output":"Discovering Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 3CL Protease Inhibitors: Virtual Screening, Surface Plasmon Resonance, and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 16-year-old female was incidentally found to have an abnormal pelvic ultrasound while undergoing evaluation for mild scoliosis.

The real needs of customers were used to create FFA. Then, the key predictors of FFA adoption were studied by integrating psychological variables, including Alertness to distinction, Openness to novelty, Orientation in the present;and Technological variables Design, Information Quality and Mobility, with comprehensive data analysis. Initially, Structural Equation Modeling was used to study the statistical relationships toward FFA acceptance, while a neural network model was used to validate the first step analysis. Findings: Analysis results from both methods confirmed that Alertness to distinction, Orientation in the present, Mobility and Openness to novelty affected FFA at statistically significant levels. Surprisingly, technological variables in terms of Design and Information Quality had no statistical relationship toward FFA.

There are many tools used to assess family planning process quality of care (QoC) but no one standardized method. Those measuring QoC in LMICs should select an appropriate tool based the program context and financial/logistical parameters, but they require data on how well each tool measures routine clinical care. We aim to synthesize the literature on validity/comparability of family planning process QoC measurement tools through a quantitative systematic review with no meta-analysis. METHODS We searched six literature databases for studies that compared quality measurements from different tools using quantitative statistics such as sensitivity/specificity, kappa statistic or absolute difference. We extracted the comparative measure along with other relevant study information, organized by quality indicator domain (e.g. counseling and privacy), and then classified the measure by low, medium, and high agreement. RESULTS We screened 8172 articles and identified eight for analysis. Studies comparing quality measurements from simulated clients, direct observation, client exit interview, provider knowledge quizzes, and medical record review were included. These eight studies were heterogenous in their methods and the measurements compared. There was insufficient data to estimate overall summary measures of validity for the tools. Client exit interviews compared to direct observation or simulated client protocols had the most data and they were a poor proxy of the actual quality care received for many measurements. CONCLUSION To measure QoC consistently and accurately in LMICs, standardized tools and measures are needed along with an established method of combining them for a comprehensive picture of quality care. Data on how different tools proxy quality client care will inform these guidelines. Despite the small number of studies found during the review, we described important differences on how tools measure quality of care.","output":"Comparability of family planning quality of care measurement tools in low-and-middle income country settings: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes, yet it remains consistently under-diagnosed. We undertook a systematic review of studies describing delirium in adult medical patients in secondary care. We investigated if changes in healthcare complexity were associated with trends in reported delirium over the last four decades. METHODS We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, only including studies using internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for delirium (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases). Estimates were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis, and we estimated temporal changes using meta-regression. We investigated publication bias with funnel plots. RESULTS We identified 15 further studies to add to 18 studies from the original review. Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19-26%) (33 studies) though this varied according to diagnostic criteria used (highest in DSM-IV, lowest in DSM-5). There was no change from 1980 to 2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. Overall, risk of bias was moderate or low, though there was evidence of increasing publication bias over time. DISCUSSION The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may have masked true changes.

Vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cells may therefore be the main mediators of protection at this early stage(7,8). The details of their induction, comparison to natural infection, and association with other arms of vaccine-induced immunity remain, however, incompletely understood. Here we show on a single-epitope level that a stable and fully functional CD8(+) T cell response is vigorously mobilized one week after prime vaccination with bnt162b2, when circulating CD4(+) T cells and neutralizing antibodies are still weakly detectable. Boost vaccination induced a robust expansion that generated highly differentiated effector CD8(+) T cells; however, neither the functional capacity nor the memory precursor T cell pool was affected. Compared with natural infection, vaccine-induced early memory T cells exhibited similar functional capacities but a different subset distribution. Our results indicate that CD8(+) T cells are important effector cells, are expanded in the early protection window after prime vaccination, precede maturation of other effector arms of vaccine-induced immunity and are stably maintained after boost vaccination.","output":"Rapid and stable mobilization of CD8(+) T cells by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aimed to determine the association of hyperlipidemia with clinical endpoints among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes. Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or  85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. Results Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9 822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. Conclusion Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.","output":"Association Analysis of Hyperlipidemia with the 28-Day All-Cause Mortality of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, production of biofuels is a rather hot topic due to depleting of conventional fossil fuel feedstocks and a number of other factors.

Many viruses replicate optimally in senescent cells, as they offer a hospitable microenvironment with persistently elevated cytosolic calcium, abundant intracellular iron, and low interferon type I. As cell-cell fusion is a major driver of cellular senescence, many viruses have developed the ability to promote this phenotype by forming syncytia. Cell-cell fusion is associated with immunosuppression mediated by phosphatidylserine externalization that enable viruses to evade host defenses. In hosts, virus-induced immune dysfunction and premature cellular senescence may predispose to neurodegenerative disorders. This concept is supported by novel studies that found postinfectious cognitive dysfunction in several viral illnesses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1, herpes simplex virus-1, and SARS-CoV-2. Virus-induced pathological syncytia may provide a unified framework for conceptualizing neuronal cell cycle reentry, aneuploidy, somatic mosaicism, viral spreading of pathological Tau and elimination of viable synapses and neurons by neurotoxic astrocytes and microglia. In this narrative review, we take a closer look at cell-cell fusion and vesicular merger in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. We present a decentralized information processing model that conceptualizes neurodegeneration as a systemic illness, triggered by cytoskeletal pathology.

This paper presents a social cybersecurity analysis of the 2020 Singaporean elections, which took place at the height of the pandemic and after the recent passage of an anti-fake news law. Harnessing a dataset of 240,000 tweets about the elections, we found that 26.99% of participating accounts were likely to be bots, responsible for a larger proportion of bot tweets than the election in 2015. Textual analysis further showed that the detected bots used simpler and more abusive second-person language, as well as hashtags related to COVID-19 and voter activitypointing to aggressive tactics potentially fuelling online hostility and questioning the legitimacy of the polls. Finally, bots were associated with larger, less dense, and less echo chamber-like communities, suggesting efforts to participate in larger, mainstream conversations. However, despite their distinct narrative and network maneuvers, bots generally did not hold significant influence throughout the social network. Hence, although intersecting concerns of political conflict during a global pandemic may promptly raise the possibility of online interference, we quantify both the efforts and limits of bot-fueled disinformation in the 2020 Singaporean elections.

In this umbrella review, we summarized the current epidemiological evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses linking ambient air pollution and CVDs, with a focus on geographical differences and vulnerable subpopulations. We performed a search strategy through multiple databases including articles between 2010 and 31st January 2021. We performed a quality assessment and evaluated the strength of evidence. Of the 56 included reviews, the most studied outcomes were stroke (22 reviews), all-cause CVD mortality and morbidity (19). The strongest evidence was found between higher short-and long-term ambient air pollution exposure and all-cause CVD mortality and morbidity, stroke, blood pressure and ischemic heart diseases (IHD). Short-term exposures to particulate matter <2.5m (PM2.5 ), <10m (PM10 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx ) were consistently associated with increased risks of hypertension and triggering of myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (fatal and non-fatal). Long-term exposures of PM2.5 were largely associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis, incident MI, hypertension, and incident stroke and stroke mortality. Few reviews evaluated other CVD outcomes including arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure but they generally reported positive statistical associations. Stronger associations were found in Asian countries and vulnerable subpopulations, especially among the elderly, cardiac patients, and people with higher weight status. Consistent with experimental data, this comprehensive umbrella review found strong evidence that higher levels of ambient air pollution increase the risk of CVDs, especially all-cause CVD mortality, stroke, and IHD.

AIMS To describe the national and regional temporal trends in emergency department (ED) admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, before, during and after the first national lockdown. METHODS The weekly numbers of ED admissions for MI and stroke were collected from the OSCOUR? network, which covers 93.3% of all ED admissions in France. National and regional incidence rate ratios from 02 February until 31 May (2020 versus 2017-2019) were estimated using Poisson regression for MI and stroke, before, during and after lockdown. RESULTS A decrease in ED admissions was observed for MI (-20% for ST-segment elevation MI and-25% for non-ST-segment elevation MI) and stroke (-18% for ischaemic and-22% for haemorrhagic) during the lockdown. The decrease became significant earlier for stroke than for MI. No compensatory increase in ED admissions was observed at the end of the lockdown for these diseases. Important regional disparities in ED admissions were observed, without correlation with the regional levels of COVID-19 cases. The impact of lockdown on ED admissions was particularly significant in six regions (Ile-de France, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-C?te d'Azur, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hauts-de-France and Bretagne). CONCLUSIONS The decrease in ED admissions for MI and stroke observed during the lockdown was probably caused by fear of COVID-19 and augmented by the lockdown, and was heterogeneous across the French territory. ED admissions were slow to return to the usual levels from previous years, without a compensatory increase. These results underline the need to reinforce messages directed at the population to encourage them to seek care without delay in case of cardiovascular symptoms.","output":"Emergency department admissions for myocardial infarction and stroke in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: National temporal trends and regional disparities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had major negative health, psychological, social and economic repercussions for individuals, families, communities, countries and for humanity in general.

Materials and Methods: To understand the working mechanism of ACF on cancer progression and tumor-stromal interplay, we evaluated pancreatic cancer in cell culture (Panc-1) (morphology, cell invasion and RNA expression) and the macrophage cell line THP1 (representing innate immune stromal cells). In the translational arm, the activity of ACF on xenograft models of human PDAC tumors representing different clinical subclasses was investigated (tumor growth, morphology and immunofluorescence, RNA expression and pathway analysis). Results: In vitro, ACF reduces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of Panc-1 cells and shifts macrophage polarization to a M1-like anti-tumoral phenotype. At non-toxic concentrations, ACF downregulates cell metabolism. In xenografts, effect on tumor growth and metabolism could be confirmed; however, the innate immune stromal cells did not respond. Importantly, only in the moderately differentiated PDAC model, ACF could significantly suppress tumor growth and not in the fast-growing EMT-high model. Pathway analysis shows that ACF highly significantly downregulates metabolic pathways, especially OXPHOS and MYC/cell proliferation pathways in xenografts. Conclusion: ACF, with known pleiotropic effects on cancer cells, is in this study shown to be an attractive therapeutic based on its novel observed metabolic activity. Repurposing this compound for cancer treatment should be in the setting with other targeting agents, which offers reduced chance of resistance development in PDAC. Further evaluation should best be done in biological complex models such as human xenografts or syngeneic cancer models.","output":"Anti-Cancer Activity of Acriflavine as Metabolic Inhibitor of OXPHOS in Pancreas Cancer Xenografts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PTPN2 is an important protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that plays a key role in cell signaling. Deletions or inactivating mutations of PTPN2 has been described in different pathologies and underline its critical role in hematopoiesis, auto-immunity and inflammation. Surprisingly, despite the major pathophysiological implications of PTPN2, the structural analysis of this PTP and notably of its pathogenic mutants remain poorly documented. Contrary to other human PTP enzymes, to date, only one structure of PTPN2 (wild-type form) has been reported. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a pathogenic mutant of PTPN2 (Cys216Gly) that causes an autoimmune enteropathy. We show in particular that this mutant adopts a classical PTP fold. More importantly, albeit inactive, the mutant retains its ability to bind substrates and to adopt the characteristic catalytically competent closed form of PTP enzymes. This novel PTPN2 structure may serve as a new tool to better understand PTP structures and the structural impacts of pathogenic mutations. Moreover, the C216G PTPN2 structure could also be helpful to design specific ligands/inhibitors. This article is protected by copyright.

HR-HPV self-sampling has been proposed to overcome barriers to in-office cervical cancer screening in underserved populations. However, little is known about baseline knowledge of HR-HPV and the acceptability of HR-HPV self-sampling among WLH. This paper describes WLHs experiences and needs regarding cervical cancer screening, specifically HR-HPV self-sampling, and seeks to reconcile their experiences with the views of their providers. In total, 10 providers and 39 WLH participated in semi-structured interviews and group discussions, respectively. Knowledge of cervical cancer and HR-HPV was generally limited among WLH; when present, it was often due to personal experience of or proximity to someone affected by cervical cancer. Most WLH were not familiar with HR-HPV self-sampling but, despite some of the providers skepticism, expressed their willingness to participate in a mail-based HR-HPV self-sampling intervention and highlighted convenience, ease of use, and affordability as facilitators to the uptake of HR-HPV self-sampling. The experiences identified can be used to guide patient-centered communication aimed at improving cervical cancer knowledge and to inform interventions, such as HR-HPV self-sampling, designed to increase cervical cancer screening among under-screened WLH.","output":"Cervical Cancer Prevention and High-Risk HPV Self-Sampling Awareness and Acceptability among Women Living with HIV: A Qualitative Investigation from the Patients and Providers Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The large volume of data generated on social networks is used by companies to monitor public opinion about their products and services These data may contain useful information for health surveillance, such as in assessing the impact of public policies or identifying fake news This work presents results of studies that demonstrate how analysis of data from social networks may be applied to surveillance activities, using the covid-19 pandemic as a case study An approach based on data science was used, with information extracted through machine learning algorithms Results indicate that this approach can reveal useful information for surveillance activities, providing a real-time view of aspects related to the pandemic","output":"Anlise de redes sociais como estratgia de apoio  vigilancia em sade durante a Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Incidence of sexually transmitted infections in Canada has been steadily rising for the past two decades, increasing the risk of vertical transmission among infected pregnant women. With 17 cases in 2018, the number of congenital syphilis across Canada has never been higher. The goal of this multicentre study was to assess practitioner's adherence to Quebec's syphilis screening and follow-up recommendations in pregnancy. Methods Charts of all women having delivered at the Centre hospitalier De l'Universit De Montral between April 1st, 2018 and March 31st, 2019 as well as at the H?pital Maisonneuve- Rosemont between April 1st, 2015 and March 31st, 2016, were reviewed to assess clinical and laboratory data. Both institutions are tertiary healthcare centres in Montreal. Results Amongst 5245 pregnant women, 5148 (98.2%) were screened for syphilis at least once during pregnancy. Of these women, 5 (0.1%) were newly diagnosed with syphilis, all of whom received appropriate treatment according to the stage of syphilis. One woman had secondary syphilis, whilst the other four had late latent syphilis. Only four had a documented antenatal consult in infectious diseases. In terms of partner management, the partner of only one woman was screened, and no mention of partner treatment was available for all cases. Regarding follow-up serology testing, four had only one control serology at 3 months, whilst one woman had no available control serology. Conclusions In this cohort, the adherence to recommendations concerning syphilis screening during pregnancy was deemed adequate compared to other Canadian screening studies. However, documentation of the management of partners of women with a new syphilis diagnosis and follow-up serology testing need improvement.

Here, combining long-read sequencing with multiple scaffolding techniques, we assembled a high-quality Tibetan genome (ZF1), with a contig N50 length of 24.57 mega-base pairs (Mb) and a scaffold N50 length of 58.80 Mb. The ZF1 assembly filled 80 remaining N-gaps (0.25 Mb in total length) in the reference human genome (GRCh38). Markedly, we detected 17 900 SVs, among which the ZF1-specific SVs are enriched in GTPase activity that is required for activation of the hypoxic pathway. Further population analysis uncovered a 163-bp intronic deletion in the MKL1 gene showing large divergence between highland Tibetans and lowland Han Chinese. This deletion is significantly associated with lower systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, one of the key adaptive physiological traits in Tibetans. Moreover, with the use of the high-quality de novo assembly, we observed a much higher rate of genome-wide archaic hominid (Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan) shared non-reference sequences in ZF1 (1.32%-1.53%) compared to other East Asian genomes (0.70%-0.98%), reflecting a unique genomic composition of Tibetans. One such archaic hominid shared sequence-a 662-bp intronic insertion in the SCUBE2 gene-is enriched and associated with better lung function (the FEV1/FVC ratio) in Tibetans.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections in patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency and compare results to current literature. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort review on 15 patients with a humoral immunodeficiency defined as Common Variable Immunodeficiency, Specific Antibody Deficiency, or unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia, who contracted COVID-19. Severity scores were determined to evaluate the clinical outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: Of our 15-patient cohort, 33% of individuals with a humoral immunodeficiency infected with COVID-19 had moderate to severe disease, requiring hospitalization or resulting in death. COVID-19 mortality rate was found to be 7%. All 5 of our patients with severe COVID-19 infection had at least 1 comorbidity or risk factor.

Tigers are iconic animals, and there is huge demand for their body parts both in the national and international illegal markets. India forms the largest tiger conservation unit in the world and poaching is at its peak even though there are stringent laws and strict enforcement. In the present study, we analytically estimated the tiger seizure cases in India from 2001C2021 using newspaper archives as the main source of data. The data was geo-referenced to understand the details of seizure, demand, and locality. We statistically correlated the seizure rate with the density of tigers, tiger reserves, and various other socio-economic factors. Our result shows that skin, claws, bones, and teeth have more demand, with nails and teeth being the most preferred in local markets. The bones, flesh, and other parts were mostly seized in the border states of the north and eastern states. The intensity of seizures is very high in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Assam. From our analysis, we predict four trade routes for the export of the seized parts: the Nepal-Bhutan border, Assam border, the Brahmaputra, and the Mumbai port. This corresponds to the five tiger conservation blocks in India, and we observed the seizure rate is high near the Western Ghats region, which has not yet been noticed. Apart from the seizure, we are unconcerned with the seizure's origin or the local trading routes. The study demonstrates the importance of identifying the source population using DNA methods and carefully enforcing the rules in area of poaching. We assert that current approaches are incapable of resolving the issue and that a more precise and effective forensic procedure capable of resolving the issue at the minute local level is critical for precisely tracing trade channels.

Inflammatory factors were reported to participate in the progress of DN. Wingless-type family member 5 (WNT5A), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), and lysine methyltransferase 8 (SETD8) have also been reported to elevate inflammatory factor levels and activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) pathway to induce endothelial dysfunction. In the current study, it was assumed that MZF1 associates with SETD8 to regulate WNT5A transcription, thus resulting in hyperglycemia-induced glomerular endothelial inflammation in DN. METHODS: The present study recruited 25 diagnosed DN patients (type 2 diabetes) and 25 control participants (nondiabetic renal cancer patients with normal renal function, stage ICII) consecutively. Moreover, a DN rat and cellular model was constructed in the present study. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were implemented to determine protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) and immunofluorescence were implemented in human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and dual luciferase assays were implemented to determine transcriptional activity. RESULTS: The results of this study indicated that levels of WNT5A expression, p65 phosphorylation (p-p65), and inflammatory factors were all elevated in DN patients and rats. In vitro, levels of p-p65 and inflammatory factors increased along with the increase of WNT5A expression in hyperglycemic HGECs. Moreover, high glucose increased MZF1 expression and decreased SETD8 expression. MZF1 and SETD8 inhibit each other under the stimulus of high glucose, but cooperate to regulate WNT5A expression, thus influencing p-p65 and endothelial inflammatory factors levels. Overexpression of MZF1 and silencing of SETD8 induced endothelial p-p65 and inflammatory factors levels, which can be reversed by si-WNT5A. Mechanistic research indicated that MZF1, SETD8, and its downstream target histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me1) all occupied the WNT5A promoter region. sh-SETD8 expanded the enrichment of MZF1 on WNT5A promoter. Our in vivo study proved that SETD8 overexpression inhibited levels of WNT5A, p-p65 expression, and inflammatory factors in DN rats. CONCLUSIONS: MZF1 links with SETD8 to regulate WNT5A expression in HGECs, thus elevating levels of hyperglycemia-mediated inflammatory factors in glomerular endothelium of DN patients and rats.

However, most patients are at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with low cardiac adverse outcomes rates. Biomarker testing with troponin levels is key in the initial assessment for ACS. Although serial troponin testing can improve the diagnosis of ACS in clinical practice, some patients deemed to be low risk are discharged after a single negative troponin test result. OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical outcomes of patients discharged after a single negative troponin test result compared with patients discharged after serial troponin measurements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective cohort study of ED encounters from May 5, 2016, to December 1, 2017, across 15 community EDs within an integrated health care system in southern California. The study cohort includes 27 918 adult ED encounters in which patients were evaluated for suspected ACS with a HEART (history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin) score and an initial conventional troponin-I measurement below the level of detection (<0.02 ng/mL). Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2019, to December 1, 2020. EXPOSURE: Single troponin test vs multiple troponin tests. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality; secondary outcomes included coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, invasive coronary angiography, and unstable angina within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the association between testing strategies and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 27 918 patient encounters (16 212 women [58.1%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [15.2] years) were included in the study. Of patients with an initial troponin measurement below the level of detection, 14 459 (51.8%) were discharged after a single troponin measurement, and 13 459 (48.2%) underwent serial troponin tests. After adjustment for cardiac risk factors and comorbidities, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality within 30 days between the 2 groups (single troponin, 56 [0.4%] vs serial troponin, 52 [0.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.96-2.07]). Patients discharged after a single troponin test had lower rates of coronary artery bypass graft (adjusted odds ratio, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11-0.48]) and invasive coronary angiography (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38-0.56]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that patients are routinely discharged from the ED after a single negative troponin test result, and when compared with serial troponin testing, a single troponin test appears safe based on current physician decision-making, with no difference in rates of 30-day cardiac mortality and acute myocardial infarction, which are low in both groups.","output":"Single vs Serial Measurements of Cardiac Troponin Level in the Evaluation of Patients in the Emergency Department With Suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ferritin, the cellular protein storage for iron, has emerged as a key molecule in the immune system, orchestrating the cellular defense against inflammation.

We then asked the booth staffers to evaluate the program and conducted qualitative analyses of public and staffer responses. Public responses to the question what would you like to know about autism? most often concerned how the disorder was diagnosed or defined. In contrast, public responses to the question what would you like others to know about autism? centered around educating those unaffected by ASD on how to improve interactions and awareness, mentioning inclusivity and intersectionality, and dispelling negative stereotypes. The staffers overwhelmingly reported that in future years, they would include even more science and allow for more in-depth conversations with interested parties, as well as bringing materials in other languages.

Bodily symptoms such as gait, balance difficulties and muscle weakness are common in people with dementia. Physical activities are important to maintain and promote physical functioning and activities of daily living.

Also synthesised strategies for sustainable implementation in nursing homes are lacking. We, therefore, aim to synthesise the evidence on physical activity interventions which can be led by nurses and to identify facilitators and barriers of sustainable implementation of physical activity for people with dementia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a mixed-methods systematic review to (1) describe the characteristics of nurse-led physical activities for people with dementia living in nursing homes and to (2) determine facilitators and barriers for sustainable implementation of nurse-led physical activities for people with dementia in nursing homes. We will search four different electronic databases, do forward and backward citation tracking and will web-search additionally. We will also search through guideline databases. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified studies for their eligibility. Data extraction and critical appraisal of included studies will be performed by one reviewer and double-checked by another reviewer. We will analyse the data using an integrative mixed-method synthesis and we will summarise the findings narratively.

Strengthening national preparedness requires National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs), or their equivalent, to overcome practical challenges affecting timely access to, and use of, data that is critical to preparedness. Our situational analysis in collaboration with NPHIs in three countries-Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan-characterises these challenges. Our findings indicate that NPHIs' role necessitates collection and analysis of data from multiple sources that do not routinely share data with public health authorities. Since initiating requests for access to new data sources can be a lengthy process, it is essential that NPHIs are routinely monitoring a broad set of priority indicators that are selected to reflect the country-specific context. NPHIs must also have the authority to be able to request rapid sharing of data from public and private sector organisations during health emergencies and to access additional human and financial resources during disease outbreaks. Finally, timely, transparent and informative communication of synthesised data from NPHIs will facilitate sustained data sharing with NPHIs from external organisations. These actions identified by our analysis will support the availability of robust information systems that allow relevant data to be collected, shared and analysed by NPHIs sufficiently rapidly to inform a timely local response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future.","output":"Using critical information to strengthen pandemic preparedness: the role of national public health agencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical reports from across the world have documented psychosis in the context of COVID-19 infection; however, there has yet to be a large-scale epidemiological study to confirm this association. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study (N = 15,935; conducted between September and December 2020), which was administered online to students attending one of 28 colleges in the United States. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined the associations between COVID-19 infection/severity and psychotic experiences over the past 12 months, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and international student status as well as anxiety and depression. RESULTS: More than one fifth of the analytic sample reported COVID-19 infection, and about one in six students with COVID-19 infection reported psychotic experiences over the past 12 months. In weighted multivariable logistic regression models, COVID-19 infection was associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences (adjusted odds ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.19C1.48). Compared with being asymptomatic, having moderate (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.03C3.31) or severe (adjusted odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.11C2.77) symptoms was associated with significantly greater odds of having psychotic experiences. These associations became statistically nonsignificant when adjusting for depression and anxiety. Hospitalization was not significantly associated with psychotic experiences among students with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotic experiences are associated with COVID-19 infections, though much of the association is attenuated when accounting for anxiety and depression.

Malnutrition has long been associated with poor outcomes among patients with pneumonia. This may be due to the increased risk of malnourished patients to develop impaired muscle and respiratory function. We aimed to determine the outcomes of adult COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary government hospital accordingly to nutrition status and risk. METHODS: Retrospective study on the adult COVID 19 patients admitted from July 15 to September 15, 2020 who were screened using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade tool. Chi-square or Fisher exact test, as well as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn test, as appropriate were done. Survival analysis for mortality was done with right-censored data length of initial admission in days. Cox proportional hazard regression was done to determine the association of the main variables of interest with mortality with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Malnourished patients were 30% less likely to be discharged [HR 0.70 95% CI (0.50, 0.97)]; malnutrition was also associated with length of hospital stay as those who were malnourished had longer lengths of hospital stay of about 4 days on the average [HR 3.55 95% CI (0.83, 6.27)]. High nutrition risk was significantly associated with length of hospital stay [HR 4.36 95% CI (0.89, 7.83)]. CONCLUSION: The only risk factor for mortality shown in this study is ICU transfer. Malnutrition, moderate nutrition risk, and high nutrition risk were risk factors of having longer lengths of hospital stays. While only malnutrition was the risk factor for being less likely to be discharged.

Despite the many successes of vaccination, continuous efforts to design new vaccines are needed to fight old pandemics, such as tuberculosis and malaria, as well as emerging pathogens, such as Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccination aims at reaching sterilizing immunity, however assessing vaccine efficacy is still challenging and underscores the need for a better understanding of immune protective responses. Identifying reliable predictive markers of immunogenicity can help to select and develop promising vaccine candidates during early preclinical studies and can lead to improved, personalized, vaccination strategies. A systems biology approach is increasingly being adopted to address these major challenges using multiple high-dimensional technologies combined with in silico models. Although the goal is to develop predictive models of vaccine efficacy in humans, applying this approach to animal models empowers basic and translational vaccine research. In this review, we provide an overview of vaccine immune signatures in preclinical models, as well as in target human populations.

These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons' performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. Methods: Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24-26 temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. Results: The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3  8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9  3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6  5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. Conclusion: A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears.

However, the non-structural protein 3C protease (3Cpro) is essential for viral replication and is relatively highly conserved among serotypes, making it a potential target for diagnostic testing. The thin film biosensor is an assay platform that can be formatted into a sensitive immunoassay for viral proteins in clinical specimens. The technology utilizes an optically coated silicon surface to convert specific molecular binding events into visual color changes by altering the reflective properties of light through molecular thin films. Objective: To develop a rapid test for detection of HRV by developing broadly serotype reactive antibodies to 3Cpro and utilizing them in the thin film biosensor format. Study design: Polyclonal antibodies to 3Cpro were purified and incorporated into the thin film assay. The in vitro sensitivity, specificity and multiserotype cross-reactivity of the 3Cpro assay were tested. Nasal washes from naturally infected individuals were also tested to verify that 3Cpro was detectable in clinical specimens. Results: The 3Cpro assay is a 28-min, non-instrumented room temperature test with a visual limit of detection of 12 pM (picomolar) 3Cpro. In terms of viral titer, as few as 1000 TCID(50) equivalents of HRV2 were detectable. The assay detected 45/52 (87%) of the HRV serotypes tested but showed no cross-reactivity to common respiratory viruses or bacteria. The thin film assay detected 3Cpro in HRV-infected cell culture supernatants coincident with first appearance of cytopathic effect. Data are also presented demonstrating 3Cpro detection from clinical samples collected from HRV-infected individuals. The assay detected 3Cpro in expelled nasal secretions from a symptomatic individual on the first day of illness. In addition, 9/11 (82%) concentrated nasal wash specimens from HRV infected children were positive in the 3Cpro test. Conclusion: We have described a novel, sensitive thin film biosensor for rapid detection of HRV 3Cpro.

Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to \\"flatten\\" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.","output":"Age-Stratified Infection Probabilities Combined With a Quarantine-Modified Model for COVID-19 Needs Assessments: Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Prediction & Control Problem: Typically, prediction is based upon historical data where plenty of data is available over extended time duration within relatively \\"static\\" linear and normal contexts Such relatively deterministic, and, [statistically] linear and normal contexts are suitable for typical AI-ML-DL driven analytics and data science driven prediction based on history The Prediction Problem occurs wherein either past data is unavailable or is sparse as in case of COVID 19 wherein future prediction is based upon negligible to sparse [but increasingly cumulative] context-specific data in real time while the specific contexts are dynamically evolving Prediction is typically used for Control as in the context of \\"flattening the curve\\" [which is a function of both minimizing the \\"spread\\" of the COVID 19 risk such as by using 'social distancing' while maximizing the \\"capacity\\" to mitigate the COVID 19 risk such as by increasing hospital bed capacity] in context of each \\"hot spot\\" [Different 'hot spots' may be characterized by differences in severity and intensity of the outbreak risk given context-specific determinants such as density and connectedness that may determine the rate and speed of spread of such risk ]","output":"Anticipatory Risk Analytics for Global Response on the Containment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in comparison to open herniorrhaphy results in reduced length of stay, less post-operative pain, earlier return to work, and reduced complications for the repair of complex ventral hernias.

The present study focuses on the changes in the vertical structure of aerosol concentration and how those changes impacted radiation balance, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height and surface meteorological parameters. Instrumented tower and Ceilometer measurements made at Gadanki (13.45N, 79.18E), located in a rural environment, coupled with satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data have been used to understand the changes in lockdown period. Significant reduction in backscatter density during the lockdown compared to 2019 indicates that aerosol reduction during the lockdown is not only limited to the surface, rather observed in the entire PBL. Except for the fourth phase of lockdown during which several relaxations have been given for vehicular movement and other anthropogenic activities, the reduction in backscatter density is seen in all phases of lockdown. However, the reduction is prominently seen in the second and third phases. The AOD also reduced by 40% around Gadanki, comparable to that of in urban regions. Due to the reduction in aerosols during the lockdown period, the insolation increases by 60 Wm?2, which is expected to increase the temperature. However, the increased loss of long-wave radiation (due to reduction in trapping gases) and more rain events during the lockdown period decreased the temperature by ~1 C. Measurements also suggest that the most of net radiation is partitioned into the latent heat flux increasing the humidity and lowering the PBL height (due to reduced strength of thermals and sensible heat flux).","output":"The impact of improved air-quality due to COVID-19 lockdown on surface meteorological parameters and planetary boundary layer over Gadanki, a tropical rural site in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is rapidly spreading all over the world.

METHODS: One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen.

Joint model analysis was used to assess the impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on the mode of hospital presentation and time to death/discharge from hospitals in Khuzestan province, Iran. Results: Among 22,356 patients, 14.2% presented to the hospital via ambulance, and 11.2% died in the hospital. The odds of ambulance use was higher in patients with older age, male sex, comorbidities including respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, and drug abuse, and symptoms such as respiratory distress and loss of consciousness. Older age, male sex, a higher burden of comorbidities, symptoms of chest pain, respiratory distress, and loss of consciousness, and admission to intensive care unit were predictors of in-hospital mortality. The median survival time was longer for patients with COVID-19 who selfpresented to the hospital compared to those who presented with ambulance (31 vs 20 days;log-rank P<0.001).

With an increasing elderly population, the number of persons with dementia is expected to increase and, consequently, the number of persons needing decision-making capacity assessments (DMCA) is too. However, many healthcare professionals do not feel ready to provide DMCAs. Since 2006, we implemented a DMCA Model that includes a care pathway, worksheets, education, and mentoring. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the utilization of this patient-centered DMCA model on the need for Capacity Interviews. METHODS. This was a retrospective quality assurance chart review of patients referred for DMCA to the Geriatric Service at the Grey Nuns Community Hospital from 2006C2020. The Geriatric Service is run by Family Physicians with extra training in Care of the Elderly. We extracted patient demographics, elements of the DMCA process, and whether Capacity Interviews were performed. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data. RESULTS. Eighty-eight patients were referred for DMCAs, with a mean age of 76 years (SD = 10.5). Dementia affected 43.2% (38/88) of patients. Valid reasons for conducting a DMCA were evident in 93% (80/86) of referrals, and DMCAs were performed in 72.6% (61/84). 85.3% (58/68) of referrals identified the need for DMCA in two to four domains, most commonly accommodation, healthcare, and finances. Two to three disciplines, frequently social workers and occupational therapists, were involved in conducting the DMCAs for 67.2% (39/58) of patients. The Capacity Assessment Process Worksheet was used 63.2% of the time. Capacity Interviews were conducted in only 20.7% of referrals. Following the DMCAs, 48.2% (41/85) of those assessed were deemed to lack capacity. CONCLUSION. This study suggests that the DMCA Model implemented has decreased the need for Capacity Interviews while simultaneously respecting patient autonomy.

Three bipolar EHG signals were analyzed for the 30 min recording. Six EHG features between multiple channels, including multivariate sample entropy, mutual information, correlation coefficient, coherence, direct partial Granger causality, and direct transfer entropy, were extracted to characterize the coupling and information flow between channels. Significant differences were found for these six features between TPL and TD, and between TTD  24 h and TTD > 24 h. No significant difference was found between TPL_PB and TPL_TD. The results indicated that EHG signals of TD were more regular and synchronized than TPL, and stronger coupling between multichannel EHG signals was exhibited as delivery approaches.

In conclusion, the coupling and propagation features extracted from multichannel EHG signals could be used to differentiate term delivery and preterm birth and may predict delivery within and beyond 24 h.","output":"Assessment of Features between Multichannel Electrohysterogram for Differentiation of Labors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The core focus of this review is to show how immediate and valid feedback, qualitative assessment influence enhances students learning in a higher education environment. With the rising trend of online education especially in this COVID-19 pandemic, the role of assessment and feedback also changes. Earlier the assessment part is not considered the main focus in learning and teaching in HEIs, but now with the increase in online education, it is observed that the paradigm is shifted toward assessing those activities of students that enhance their learning outcomes. A lot of research work has been done on developing assessment strategies and techniques that can support learning and teaching effectively. Yet, there is limited research that looks at how methods applied in learning analytics can be used and possibly constitutes the assessment process. The objective of this work is to provide an exploratory and comparative study of how assessment and feedback practices can enhance students learning outcomes using AI. The key contribution of this study attempts to capture an outline of the most used artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for student success. The results showed that I-FCN performed better than other techniques (ANN, XG Boost, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Trees) in all measured performance metrics. Also, the result of the comparative analysis study will help the educators, instructors, and administrators on how they could take the advantage of a data-driven approach, design less pressurized, more valid, reliable, constructive assessment findings, and connect the power of assessment and feedback to enhance the learning outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To detect SARS-CoV-2 in expressed breast milk (EBM) of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 and clinical outcome of neonates delivered and breast fed by them. DESIGN: A single-centre, prospective observational study involving 50 SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and their 51 neonates. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and neonates delivered by them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the breast milk of mothers, who tested positive for this virus in their nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Clinical outcome was assessed in neonates breast fed by these mothers after 1 month of the postnatal period. RESULTS: 50 SARS-CoV-2-positive expectant mothers were enrolled for the study. One out of 51 neonates, who delivered through lower segment caesarean section at term gestation and tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, died due to severe birth asphyxia. One sample of EBM was collected from each of the 49 mothers within 4 days of delivery. All EBM samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). All the newborns were screened twice for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their NPS, by RT-PCR. 2 of 51 neonates had COVID-19 infection after 24 hours of life. Caregivers of 37 of 50 alive neonates responded to follow-up via telephone. Except for minor feed intolerance in one (1 of 37) neonate, all neonates were reported well after 1 month of their age. CONCLUSION: All the samples of breast milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Ecocriticism publications in 2019 reflect an imperative to devise new means of signification in response to planetary concerns. The biospheric urgencies of the Anthropocene and its catastrophic imprint of climate change continue to draw ecocritical attention to issues of time, scale, embodiment, and affect. Attuned to the Anthropocene context, 2019 publications demonstrate sustained attention to posthumanist thinking, including more-than-human ontologies. More specifically, the year brought valuable additions to postcolonial ecocriticism, affective ecocriticism, and zoocriticism as well as strides in the theorization of ecophobia. New directions in phytocriticism, hydrocriticism, and sumbiocriticism (an ecocritical mode attentive to the manner in which a text engages ideas of symbiosis) evince the fields ongoing diversification within the environmental humanities ambit. 2019 saw significant developments in ecopoetic studies as well as highly generative confluences between ecocriticism and ecomedia studies, two complementary fields regarded historically as separate domains.

METHODOLOGY The data of the demographic, clinical, laboratory findings of hospitalized CoV-alone, asthma, COPD patients with COVID-19 (CoV-asthma, CoV-COPD, respectively), and CoV-com were analyzed. RESULTS Out of 1082 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 585 (54.1%) had CoV-alone, 40 (3.7%) had CoV-asthma, 46 (4.3%) had CoV-COPD and 411 (38%) had CoV-com. Cough, shortness of breath, fever and weakness were the most common four symptoms seen in all COVID-19 patients. Shortness of breath, myalgia, headache symptoms were more common in CoV-asthma than the other groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05 respectively). Sputum was more common in CoV-COPD than other groups (p < 0.01).

Qualitative analyses indicated that moral objection towards inflicting pain and suffering to pigs was the main reason for the greater support for all the alternatives compared to surgical castration without pain control. Yet, support for all alternatives was somewhat limited by concerns with reduced meat quality, which some participants associated with boar taint or other residues in meat. Moving away from surgical castration without pain control is a necessary step for the pig industry to retain its social license. ABSTRACT: We explored the attitudes of Brazilians towards different methods to deal with boar taint in pork (surgical castration without pain control, SC; surgical castration with pain control, SC+PC; immunocastration, IC; raising entire males, EM). Two surveys (Sv1, n = 441 and Sv2, n = 768) containing closed and open questions were conducted. Nearly 70% of Sv1 and Sv2 participants were unaware that meat of entire males may have boar taint and that SC is widely used in pig production in Brazil. In Sv1, acceptability of SC+PC (63%) and IC (53%) was greater than of SC (15%). In Sv2, acceptability of IC (55%) and EM (52%) was greater than of SC (18%). Open-ended responses indicated that participants objected to inflicting pain to pigs to attain a production goal, and were concerned with organoleptic traits and risks of exogenous residues in pork. Participants views regarding the potential increases in the cost of meat due to adoption of alternative methods varied; some argued that avoiding pain justifies an increase in the price of pork and others that this would impact especially lower income citizens. Our findings indicate that participants opposed surgical castration without pain control, and supported alternative methods. However, the concern with potential risks of presence of residues in meat, expressed by a few participants, may need to be addressed among consumers.","output":"On the Road to End Pig Pain: Knowledge and Attitudes of Brazilian Citizens Regarding Castration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, one of the most significant diseases of today's world.

METHODS: Data about the total number of cases, tests, and rates of COVID-19 as of June 10, 2020 were obtained for cities and towns in MA. The data on COVID-19 were matched with data on various SDoH variables at the city and town level from the American Community Survey. These variables included information about income, poverty, employment, renting, and insurance coverage. We compared COVID-19 rates according to these SDoH variables. RESULTS: There were clear gradients in the rates of COVID-19 according to SDoH variables. Communities with more poverty, lower income, lower insurance coverage, more unemployment, and a higher percentage of the workforce employed in essential services, including healthcare, had higher rates of COVID-19. Most of these differences were not accounted for by different rates of testing in these cities and towns. CONCLUSIONS: SDoH variables may explain some of the variability in the risk of COVID-19 across cities and towns in MA. Data about SDoH should be part of the standard surveillance for COVID-19.

Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries from 2002 to 2003. Given the significant morbidity and mortality rate, the current pandemic poses a danger to all of humanity, prompting us to understand the activity of SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic level. Experimental studies have revealed that spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering the cell for replication. However, the binding affinities reported by different groups seem to contradict each other. Wrapp et al. (Science2020, 367, 1260C1263) showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) more strongly than does SARS-CoV, and this fact may be associated with a greater severity of the new virus. However, Walls et al. (Cell2020, 181, 281C292) reported that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher binding affinity, but the difference between the two variants is relatively small. To understand the binding mechnism and experimental results, we investigated how the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) interacts with a human ACE2-PD using molecular modeling. We applied a coarse-grained model to calculate the dissociation constant and found that SARS-CoV-2 displays a 2-fold higher binding affinity. Using steered all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, like a coarse-grained simulation, SARS-CoV-2-RBD was associated with ACE2-PD more strongly than was SARS-CoV-RBD, as evidenced by a higher rupture force and larger pulling work.

The SPR band peak shift was also examined as the pH values were hopped between pH ~ 3 and pH ~ 10 (pH hopping). As the pH values hopped, an alternation of the average SPR band peaks were observed. A significant amplitude of an alternation was especially observed for the mixture of S protein with gold 30 nm of gold size implying the reproduction of pH induced reversible protein folding. We hypothesize that the pH hopping scheme captured a reversible transition between folded or Down conformation (pH  ~7) and unfolded or Up (pH ~ 3) conformation of RBD (receptor binding domain).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether changes in psychoactive substance trade on Telegram markets in the Netherlands can be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Between December 2, 2019, and June 29, 2020, a total of 70,226 posts appeared in two analyzed Telegram groups. A total of 5,643 posts were psychoactive substance related. Based on the analyzed posts, Telegram is mostly a '\\"sellers\\" market as only a minority of the posts (6.3%) could be identified as a request for a substance. The proportion of posts related to specific substances varied between the periods before, during, and after the lockdown. The proportion of posts on the stimulants ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamine was lower during the lockdown than before and after. For psychedelics - ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) - and other substances, there was a relative increase in the number of posts during the lockdown, which was maintained after the lockdown.

Previous studies have found that emotional creativity can positively predict posttraumatic growth and mental health. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed great challenges to peoples daily lives and their mental health status. Therefore, this study aims to address the following two questions: whether emotional creativity can improve posttraumatic growth and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it works. To do this, a multiple mediation model has been proposed, which supposes that emotional creativity is associated with posttraumatic growth and mental health through perceived social support and regulatory emotional self-efficacy. The study involved 423 participants from multiple regions with different COVID-19 involvement levels. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire with six parts, which included Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI), Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy Scale (RES), Stress-Related Growth Scale-Short Form (SRGS-SF), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support scale (MSPSS), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 scale (BSI-18), and COVID-19-related life events questionnaire. Path analysis used to examine the mediation model indicated that under the control of COVID-19-related life events and age, perceived social support mediated a positive association between emotional creativity and posttraumatic growth as well as a negative association between emotional creativity and all mental health problems, including somatization, depression, and anxiety. Regulatory emotional self-efficacy mediates the association between emotional creativity and posttraumatic growth, emotional creativity and anxiety, and emotional creativity and depression.

COVID-19 is a complex disorder affecting multiple body systems, potentially damaging lungs, affecting the cardiovascular system or causing muscle weakness. Therefore, the impact of COVID-19 on performance was a major concern for the affected football players and their entourage. Objectives: To retrospectively examine the influence of COVID-19 on physical performance and mental health in professional football athletes during the season 2020C2021. Methods: Thirty-three professional athletes (age: 25.37  4.11 years; height: 182.75  7.62 cm; weight: 78.90  8.97 kg) of a Belgian first division football club were assessed weekly during the 2020-2021 season. Weekly assessments comprised strength values of the hamstrings, hip abductors and hip adductors, jump performance, a modified Hooper questionnaire to assess mental status and nose swab PCR tests for COVID-19. Data analysis was performed from 2 weeks prior to COVID-19 contamination up to 8 weeks after the first positive test. Post-hoc Bonferroni correction was applied when performing statistical analysis. Results: Eleven players tested positive for COVID-19. Duration of contamination was 13  7 days.

Global gene expression profiles provide a snapshot of all the genes that are transcribed in a cell or in a tissue under a particular condition. The high-dimensionality of such gene expression data (i.e., very large number of features/genes analyzed with relatively much less number of samples) makes it difficult to identify the key genes (biomarkers) that are truly attributing to a particular phenotype or condition, (such as cancer), de novo. For identifying the key genes from gene expression data, among the existing literature, mutual information (MI) is one of the most successful criteria. However, the correction of MI for finite sample is not taken into account in this regard. It is also important to incorporate dynamic discretization of genes for more relevant gene selection, although this is not considered in the available methods. Besides, it is usually suggested in current studies to remove redundant genes which is particularly inappropriate for biological data, as a group of genes may connect to each other for downstreaming proteins. Thus, despite being redundant, it is needed to add the genes which provide additional useful information for the disease. Addressing these issues, we proposed Mutual information based Gene Selection method (MGS) for selecting informative genes. Moreover, to rank these selected genes, we extended MGS and propose two ranking methods on the selected genes, such as MGS(f)based on frequency and MGS(rf)based on Random Forest. The proposed method not only obtained better classification rates on gene expression datasets derived from different gene expression studies compared to recently reported methods but also detected the key genes relevant to pathways with a causal relationship to the disease, which indicate that it will also able to find the responsible genes for an unknown disease data.","output":"Use of relevancy and complementary information for discriminatory gene selection from high-dimensional gene expression data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior studies on PRRSV strain VR-2332 non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) had shown that as much as 403 amino acids could be removed from the hypervariable region without losing virus viability in vitro.

Young swine (4 pigs/group; 5 control swine) were inoculated intramuscularly with one of 4 nsp2 deletion mutants (r727C813, r543C726, r324C523, r324C726) or full-length recombinant virus (rVR-2332). Serum samples were collected on various days post-inoculation and analyzed by HerdChek* ELISA, PRRSV real time RT-PCR, gamma interferon (IFN-) ELISA, and nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire nsp2 coding region. Tracheobronchial lymph node weight compared to body weight was recorded for each animal and used as a clinical measurement of viral pathogenesis. Results showed that all deletion mutants grew less robustly than full-length recombinant virus, yet all but the large deletion virus (r324C726) recovered to parental viral RNA levels by study end. Swine receiving the r727C813 mutants had a significant decrease in lymph node enlargement compared to rVR-2332. While swine infection with rVR-2332 caused a rapid rise in serum IFN- levels, the IFN- protein produced by infection with 3 of the 4 deletion mutant viruses was significantly reduced, perhaps due to differences in viral growth kinetics. The r543C726 nsp2 mutant virus, although growth impaired, mimicked rVR-2332 in inducing a host serum IFN- response but exhibited a 2-week delay. Targeted sequencing showed that all deletions were stable in the region coding for nsp2 after one swine passage. The data suggested that the selected nsp2 deletion mutants were growth attenuated in swine, altered the induction of serum IFN-, an innate cytokine of unknown function in PRRSV clearance, and pointed to a domain that may influence tracheobronchial lymph node size.","output":"In vivo growth of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus engineered nsp2 deletion mutants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has globally introduced a new crisis with severe consequences and led to a series of pandemic-related containment measures, including social distancing and self-isolation may cause significant impact on mental health.

Neutralization titers seemed generally consistent with anti-S IgG results. Results were not adjusted for differences in baseline clinical factors, including other immunosuppressant therapies. LIMITATIONS: Small sample that lacked demographic diversity, and residual confounding. CONCLUSION: Compared with nonusers, patients with CID treated with glucocorticoids and BCDT seem to have lower SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced antibody responses.

We investigated the association of pre-existing medical conditions and self-perceived health status with the risk of mental health complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In October-December, 2020, 1036 respondents completed online survey that included assessment of pre-existing conditions, self-perceived health status, depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 score  10), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 score  10) and post-traumatic stress (Impact of Events Scale Revised) symptoms, alcohol use (AUDIT), and COVID-19 fear (COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions). RESULTS Study participants were predominantly women (83%), younger than 61 years of age (94%). Thirty-six percent of respondents had a pre-existing condition and 5% considered their health status as bad or very bad. Pre-existing conditions and poor perceived health status were associated with increased risk for moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, fear of COVID-19 and post-traumatic stress symptoms, independently from respondents' age, gender, living area, smoking status, exercise, alcohol consumption and diet.

In this framework, temporary pop-up environments act as an innovative and sustainable type of living system. These are structures conceived as temporary from the outset, based on characteristics like flexible light-weight technologies, fast and easy assembly operations, temporary occupation of the ground and adaptability to different uses, needs and target groups. Great importance is placed on construction reversibility and environmental sustainability. In the framework of the interdisciplinary research project Urban Pop-Up Housing Environments and Their Potential as Local Innovation Systems, six scenarios of application for temporary pop-up environments for the city of Vienna have been developed, taking into consideration technical, urban and social aspects, on the basis of local uses and climatic conditions. In order to explore drivers and barriers of the scenarios regarding the transferability of the concepts, online questionnaire sessions were conducted with an international audience. The feedback obtained by the participants allowed an analysis of the applicability of the concepts to other urban environments under comparable conditions at the international level. The paper presents the results obtained from the questionnaire sessions, allowing insight on the international perception of temporary pop-up environments and, specifically, strengths and weaknesses of the scenarios, as well as their possible applicability in the local contexts of the respondents. It was observed that while the perceptions of what requirements temporary housing must fulfil in order to be sustainable are quite uniform among the experts, the identified barriers for implementation within the different international contexts differed greatly. The designs of these temporary housing scenarios, which rely heavily on local resources and systems, are strongly interwoven with the fabric and conditions of the city they were conceptualised for. While this serves to promote the sustainability of these solutions, it poses a particular challenge for the international transferability, requiring heavy adaptation for other contexts.","output":"Drivers and Barriers for Implementation and International Transferability of Sustainable Pop-up Living Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential death toll from an epidemic is larger than the number of deaths directly associated with the infection.

Such a shift of perspective could best be illustrated at the international level if the World Health Organization (WHO) takes on environmental issues. Therefore, this article analyses, by example of the global waste challenge, the WHO's Constitution and the International Health Regulations (2005) to determine its potential and limitations as an actor in international environmental law.

Hence in this work, the applications of nanostructures as anticancer drug-delivery carriers were widely investigated to target cancerous tissues. Based on DFT calculations, we investigated the transition metal-doped boron nitride nanostructure as a drug-delivery agent for the gemcitabine drug utilizing the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level of theory. In this research, the adsorption energy and electronic parameters of gemcitabine on the interaction with the metal-doped BN nanostructures were studied. It has been observed that metal doping significantly enhances the drug-delivery properties of BN nanostructures. Among the investigated nanostructures, NiCBN has been found to be the most prominent nanostructure to transport gemcitabine with an elevated value of adsorption energy in both the gas phase (?45.79) and water media (?32.46). The interaction between gemcitabine and BN nanostructures was confirmed through frontier molecular orbitals and stabilization energy analysis. The fractional charge transfer, MEP, NCI, and NBO analyses exposed the charge transfer from drug molecule to the BN nanostructures. Transition density maps and UV-VIS spectra were also plotted to investigate the excited-state properties of the designed complexes. Thus, the present study provides an in-depth interaction mechanism of the gemcitabine drug with BN, which reveals that metal-doped BN nanostructures can be a favorable drug-delivery vehicle for the gemcitabine anticancer drug.","output":"Investigation of the adsorption properties of gemcitabine anticancer drug with metal-doped boron nitride fullerenes as a drug-delivery carrier: a DFT study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE to determine the accuracy of susceptibility-weighted MRI (SWI) for the detection of arteriovenous shunting (AVS) in vascular malformations of the brain (BVM). METHODS we retrospectively identified 60 patients who had been evaluated for known or suspected BVM by both SWI and digital subtraction angiography, without intervening treatment, during a 3-year period. SWI images were retrospectively assessed by 2 independent reviewers for the presence of AVS as determined by the presence of signal hyperintensity within a venous structure in the vicinity of the BVM. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus among a panel of 3 neuroradiologists. Accuracy parameters of SWI for the detection of AVS were calculated using digital subtraction angiography as the reference standard. RESULTS a total of 80 BVM were identified in the 60 patients included in our study. Of the 29 BVM with AVS on digital subtraction angiography, 14 were untreated arteriovenous malformations, 10 were previously treated arteriovenous malformations, and 5 were untreated dural arteriovenous fistulas. Overall, SWI was 93% sensitive and 98% specific for the detection of AVS in BVM, with excellent interobserver agreement (=0.94). In the 14 previously treated arteriovenous malformations, SWI was 100% sensitive and specific for the detection of AVS. In the 28 BVM associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, SWI was 100% sensitive and 96% specific for the detection of AVS.

The exact etiology of OAB is still enigmatic, and none of therapeutic approaches seems curative. OAB is generally regarded as a separate syndrome, whereas in clinic, OAB symptoms could be found in numerous diseases of other non-urogenital systems, particularly nervous system. The OAB symptoms in neurological diseases are often poorly recognized and inadequately treated. This review provided a comprehensive overview of recent findings related to the neurogenic OAB symptoms. Relevant neurological diseases could be mainly divided into seven kinds as follows: multiple sclerosis and related neuroinflammatory disorders, Parkinsons diseases, multiple system atrophy, spinal cord injury, dementia, peripheral neuropathy, and others. Concurrently, we also summarized the hypothetical reasonings and available animal models to elucidate the underlying mechanism of neurogenic OAB symptoms. This review highlighted the close association between OAB symptoms and neurological diseases and expanded the current knowledge of pathophysiological basis of OAB.

Clinical data and laboratory findings were obtained and compared between cancer and non-cancer groups. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were identified by multivariable COX regression models.Findings: The median age of cancer group was older than that in non-cancer patients [61 (57-67) vs. 56 (40-68), p < 0.001]. For cancer group, 56% were in severe and critical status, while the proportion was 10% for non-cancer group. Cancer patients had increased levels of leukocyte, neutrophil count and BUN (all p < 0.01), while lymphocyte count was significantly lower (p < 0.001). The most common solid tumor types were gastrointestinal cancer (26%), lung cancer (21%), breast and reproductive cancer (both 19%). There is a rising for cardiac biomarkers, including Pro-BNP, cTnI, MYO, CK-MB, and D-Dimer in COVID-19 cancer population, especially in deceased cancer subjects. The 30-day in hospital mortality in cancer group was dramatically raised than that in non-cancer group (12.9% vs. 4.0%, p<0.01). In multivariable COX regression models, fever, disease severity status, underlying diseases were risk factors for mortality. The Pro-BNP and D-Dimer levels were significantly increased in cancer subjects with cardiovascular disease.Interpretation: COVID-19 cancer patients relate to deteriorating conditions, increased risk of admission to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality.

Our objective was to investigate anticoagulation reversal and resumption strategies by evaluating incidences of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, thereby defining an optimal time-window when to restart therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) in patients with MHV and ICH. Methods and results We pooled individual patient-data (n = 2504) from a nationwide multicentre cohort-study (RETRACE, conducted at 22 German centres) and eventually identified MHV-patients (n = 137) with anticoagulation-associated ICH for outcome analyses. The primary outcome consisted of major haemorrhagic complications analysed during hospital stay according to treatment exposure (restarted TA vs. no-TA). Secondary outcomes comprised thromboembolic complications, the composite outcome (haemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications), timing of TA, and mortality. Adjusted analyses involved propensity-score matching and multivariable cox-regressions to identify optimal timing of TA. In 66/137 (48%) of patients TA was restarted, being associated with increased haemorrhagic (TA = 17/66 (26%) vs. no-TA = 4/71 (6%); P < 0.01) and a trend to decreased thromboembolic complications (TA = 1/66 (2%) vs. no-TA = 7/71 (10%); P = 0.06). Controlling treatment crossovers provided an incidence rate-ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 10.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67-35.70; P < 0.01] in disadvantage of TA for haemorrhagic complications. Analyses of TA-timing displayed significant harm until Day 13 after ICH (HR 7.06, 95% CI 2.33-21.37; P < 0.01). The hazard for the composite-balancing both complications, was increased for restarted TA until Day 6 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.10-5.70; P = 0.03). Conclusion Restarting TA within less than 2 weeks after ICH in patients with MHV was associated with increased haemorrhagic complications. Optimal weighing-between least risks for thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications-provided an earliest starting point of TA at Day 6, reserved only for patients at high thromboembolic risk.","output":"Management of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and mechanical heart valves."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, integrated landscape (Cseascape) approachesIL(S)Ashave been gaining prominence as holistic, collaborative, and tangible solutions to biodiversity conservation and sustainability challenges.

We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC). FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 861 [95% CI 283-262; p=00002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (136 [113-162]; p=00009).

Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering three risk groups was done between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and were sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: Overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI: 26.1 to 29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5 to 18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5 to 13.8). Case-to-infection ratio 1:40, and infection fatality rate 0.05%. Influenza-like-symptoms or contact with COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatics compared to 47% asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our sentinel-based population survey is the first comprehensive survey to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden. Our findings provide a reasonable approximation of the population immunity threshold levels.

A growing body of research has highlighted several comorbidities and presenting factors in which delay or permanent deferral of surgery may be considered; however, modern comprehensive summative reviews are lacking. The urgency and timing of this review are underscored by significant challenges in resource utilization posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an update on the current understanding of risk assessment, surgical candidacy, and operative timing in patients with ATAAD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant studies relating to risk assessment in ATAAD. Articles were selected via group consensus based on quality and relevance. RESULTS: Several patient factors have been identified which increase risk in ATAAD repair. In particular, frailty, advanced age, prior cardiac surgery, and use of novel anticoagulant medications have been studied. The understanding of malperfusion syndromes has also expanded significantly, including recommendations for surgical delay. Finally, approaches to triage have been significantly influenced by resource limitations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While medical management remains a reasonable option in carefully selected patients at prohibitive risk for open surgery, endovascular therapies for treatment of ATAAD are rapidly evolving. CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical repair remains the preferred treatment for most patients with ATAAD, however, improvements in risk stratification should guide appropriate delay or permanent deferral of surgery in select individuals.","output":"When to Consider Deferral of Surgery in Acute Type A Aortic Dissection: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycosylation plays important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Emerging data suggests an association for venous thromboembolism (VTE) development in COVID-19 patients. Treatments for DVT vary and include thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and long-term anticoagulation. We describe a unique case of this in a postpartum female. Case A 31 year old female G3P0121 and recent cesarean section 1 month ago presented with left lower extremity swelling, severely limited ambulation and 3+ edema of the left leg extending to the hip without any right leg edema. She was COVID-19 antibody positive. Occlusive DVTs were confirmed via venous duplex ultrasound and computed tomographic venography of the abdomen and pelvis, extending from distal inferior vena cava to the left popliteal vein. Decision-making Invasive venography confirmed the non-invasive imaging findings. After administering 12-14 mg of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), multiple aspirations were performed using a rheolytic thrombectomy catheter. However persistent dense thrombus in the iliac and femoral veins remained, thus subsequent balloon angioplasty was performed but unsuccessful. Intravascular ultrasound confirmed the presence of May-Thurner syndrome at the junction of the left common iliac vein and the inferior vena cava. Finally an infusion catheter was placed for tPA. Within 48 hours, patient developed oliguric renal failure likely due to a combination of contrast-induced and pigment nephropathy requiring intermittent hemodialysis. Repeat ultrasound showed resolution of DVT along with improving edema and renal function. Warfarin was chosen for long-term anticoagulation due to renal failure and breast-feeding.

The groundwater considered a significant water resource specifically in regions where the surface water is not sufficient. Therefore, the research problem is focused on district-wise sustainable groundwater management due to urbanization. The number of impervious surface areas like roofing on built-up areas, concrete and asphalt road surface were increased due to the level of urban development. Thus, these surface areas can inhibit infiltration and surface retention by the impact of urbanization because vegetation/forest areas are decreased. The present research examines the district-wise spatiotemporal groundwater storage (GWS) changes under terrestrial water storage using the global land data assimilation system-2 (GLDAS-2) catchment land surface model (CLSM) from 2000 to 2014 in West Bengal, India. The objective of the research is mainly focused on the delineation of groundwater stress zones (GWSZs) based on ten biophysical and hydrological factors according to the deficiency of groundwater storage using the analytic hierarchy process by the GIS platform. Additionally, the spatiotemporal soil moisture (surface soil moisture, root zone soil moisture, and profile soil moisture) changes for the identification of water stress areas using CLSM were studied. Finally, generated results were validated by the observed groundwater level and groundwater recharge data. The sensitivity analysis has been performed for GWSZs mapping due to the deficit of groundwater storage. Three correlation coefficient methods (Kendall, Pearson and Spearman) are applied for the interrelationship between the most significant parameters for the generation of GWSZ from sensitivity analysis. The results show that the northeastern (max: 1097.35 mm) and the southern (max: 993.22 mm) parts have high groundwater storage due to higher amount of soil moisture and forest cover compared to other parts of the state.

Earlier, withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment was taboo in the medical society in South Korea due to the history of such practice being punishable by law, and physicians tended to pursue aggressive treatment. With changes in public opinion on end-of-life care, the Korean government enacted a new law that protect human dignity by respecting patients self-determination and facilitating advance care planning. However, little is known about current state of advance care planning for pediatric patients. The study aimed to assess perceptions regarding advance care planning among South Korean pediatricians and clarify any differences in perception among pediatric subspecialties. METHODS: This study was an observational cross-sectional survey that used a web-based self-report questionnaire. Participants comprised of pediatricians currently caring for children with life-limiting conditions in 2018. RESULTS: Of the 96 respondents, 89 were included in the analysis. In a hypothetical patient scenario, more hemato-oncologists and intensivists than neonatologists and neurologists preferred to provide comfort care than aggressive treatment. While 72.2% of hemato-oncologists reported that they usually or always discuss advance care plans with parents during treatment, more than half of other pediatricians reported that they seldom do so. Furthermore, 65% of respondents said that they never discuss advance care planning with adolescent patients. Moreover, there were no notable differences among subspecialties. The most prevalent answers to factors impeding advance care planning were lack of systemic support after performing advance care planning (82.0%) and uncertain legal responsibilities (70.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The pediatricians differed in their experiences and attitudes toward advance care planning based on their subspecialty.

We surveyed organizations that were supporting DSD models in 2019 in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia to describe the diversity of DSD models being implemented at that time. METHODS: We interviewed DSD model implementing organizations for descriptive information about each of the organization's models of care. We described the key characteristics of each model, including population of patients served, location of service delivery, frequency of interactions with patients, duration of dispensing, and cadre(s) of provider involved. To facilitate analysis, we refer to 1 organization supporting 1 model of care as an organization-model. RESULTS: The 34 respondents (8 in Malawi, 16 in South Africa, 10 in Zambia) interviewed described a total of 110 organization-models, which included 19 facility-based individual models, 21 out-of-facility-based individual models, 14 health care worker-led groups, and 3 client-led groups; jointly, these encompassed 12 specific service delivery strategies, such as multimonth dispensing, adherence clubs, home delivery, and changes to facility hours. Over two-thirds (n=78) of the organization-models were limited to clinically stable patients. Almost all organization-models (n=96) continued to provide clinical care at established health care facilities; medication pickup took place at facilities, external pickup points, and adherence clubs. Required numbers of provider interactions per year varied widely, from 2 to 12. Dispensing intervals were typically 3 or 6 months in Malawi and Zambia and 2 months in South Africa. Individual models relied more on clinical staff, while group models made greater use of lay personnel.

These immunosenescent signatures are similar to those seen in individuals exposed to social adversity, who may age more rapidly than those unexposed. Yet, it is unclear how social adversity alters immunity across demographic factors - data that are essential to identify how it might increase aging-related diseases. Here, we investigated how age, sex, and social adversity predicted immune cell proportions in 250 rhesus macaques living in a semi-naturalistic colony. As macaques aged, they exhibited signatures of immunosenescence. Older individuals had signatures of diminished antibody production and adaptive immunity, with declines in CD20+ B cells, CD20+/CD3+ cell ratio, and the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio. At all ages, females had higher CD20+/CD3+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratios, indicative of a stronger antibody and adaptive immune response that may facilitate pathogen clearance even with increasing age. Older individuals had signatures of inflammation, with higher proportions of CD3+/CD8+ Cytotoxic T cells, CD16+/CD3- Natural Killer cells, CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ and CD3+/CD8+/CD25+ T regulatory cells, and CD14+/CD16+/HLA-DR+ intermediate monocytes, combined with lower levels of CD14+/CD16-/HLA-DR+ classical monocytes. Notably, we found an interaction between age and social adversity, where low-status individuals had higher proportions of CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ T regulatory cells for their age, compared to higher-status individuals.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic sensing paradigm to collect real-time observations from online users. In this vision paper we propose CovidSens, the concept of social-sensing-based risk alerting systems to notify the general public about the COVID-19 spread. The CovidSens concept is motivated by two recent observations: 1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, and 2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media. We anticipate an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the social media users to build a real-time analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions of: how to track the spread of the COVID-19? How to distill reliable information about the disease with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively and alert them to remain prepared? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in implementing reliable social-sensing-based risk alerting systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g. estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges.

Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and the patient was initially planned to undergo surgical resection, however his functional status declined while pursuing pre-operative workup. He had progressive worsening hemoptysis, despite radiation treatment, requiring multiple transfusions of blood products. Interventional radiology performed bronchial artery embolization with interval improvement, however he progressed requiring endotracheal intubation with endobronchial blocker placement. Bleeding continued despite local treatment and family decided on palliative extubation. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to delayed diagnosis of lung cancer. Analysis of 20 institutions in the United States showed a 46.8% decrease in new lung cancer diagnoses in April 2020 versus April 20192. In Korea, three university hospitals found a significant increase in patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer compared to prior years3. UK Health Service data modeling predict 4.8-5.3% increased lung cancer related mortality from pandemic delayed diagnosis5. In our case, the diagnosis was delayed due to the patient's uncertainty about accessing the medical system during a pandemic. This is not uncommon-the pandemic has been cited as a reason for refusing breast lesion biopsy4. Clinicians need to be aware of this fear and make efforts to reassure patients of the additional safety protocols in place. The American College of Surgery recommends that procedures for high risk cancers, such as lung cancer, are high acuity on the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale and diagnosis and staging to start treatment not be delayed, if feasible, during the pandemic6,7. Lung cancer may be uniquely impacted by pandemic staffing shortages as pulmonologists are deployed to surging ICUs. Our patient delayed care during a surge and did not have a risk/benefit discussion with a clinician. This highlights the need to develop additional patient outreach systems to ensure timely access to care during a pandemic.","output":"Fatal massive hemoptysis in a patient with delayed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma due to covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health security in the European Union (EU) aims to protect citizens from serious threats to health such as biological agents and infectious disease outbreaks- whether natural, intentional or accidental.

Film-forming sprays consist of polymers and excipients that improve the characteristics of preparations and enhance the stability of active substances. Each type of polymer and excipient will produce films with different features. Therefore, the various types of polymers and excipients and their evaluation standards need to be examined for the development of a more optimal form of film-forming spray. The selected literature included research on polymers as film-forming matrices and the application of these sprays for medical purposes or for potential medical use. This article discusses the types and concentrations of polymers and excipients, sprayer types, evaluations, and critical parameters in determining the sprayability and film characteristics.

A severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: Which organ systems are predominantly involved? Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death. RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis. Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction. Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus. Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20C30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis. Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis. In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands. The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells. Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the pulmonary circulation with pulmonary arterial thrombosis, infarction, and bacterial pneumonia are important and often lethal complications of COVID-19-associated ARDS.

A maladaptive stress response is implicated in both mental health disorders and metabolic disorders, implicating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as a key mediator of this relationship. This review explores how an altered energetic state, such as hyper- or hypoglycemia, as may be manifested in obesity or diabetes, affects the stress response and the HPA axis in particular. We propose that changes in energetic state or energetic demands can result in \\"energetic stress\\" that can, if prolonged, lead to a dysfunctional stress response. In this review, we summarize the role of the hypothalamus in modulating energy homeostasis and then briefly discuss the relationship between metabolism and stress-induced activation of the HPA axis. Next, we examine seven mechanisms whereby energetic stress interacts with neuroendocrine stress response systems, including by glucocorticoid signaling both within and beyond the HPA axis; by nutrient-induced changes in glucocorticoid signaling; by impacting the sympathetic nervous system; through changes in other neuroendocrine factors; by inducing inflammatory changes; and by altering the gut-brain axis.

In this work we briefly review structural biology and computational clues on representative single-subunit viral polymerases that are more or less connected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in particular, to elucidate how nucleotide substrates and potential drug analogs are selected in the viral genome synthesis. To do that, we first survey two well studied RdRps from Polio virus and hepatitis C virus in regard to structural motifs and key residues that have been identified for the nucleotide selectivity. Then we focus on related structural and biochemical characteristics discovered for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. To further compare, we summarize what we have learned computationally from phage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) on its stepwise nucleotide selectivity, and extend discussion to a structurally similar human mitochondria RNAP, which deserves special attention as it cannot be adversely affected by antiviral treatments. We also include viral phi29 DNA polymerase for comparison, which has both helicase and proofreading activities on top of nucleotide selectivity for replication fidelity control.

Epigenetic ages of each individual are determined by applying epigenetic clocks and telomere length estimator to the methylation profile of the individual. Epigenetic age acceleration is calculated and compared between groups. We observe strong correlations between the epigenetic clocks and individuals chronological age (r > 0.8, p < 0.0001). We also find the increasing acceleration of epigenetic aging and telomere attrition in the sequential blood samples from healthy individuals and infected patients developing non-severe and severe COVID-19. In addition, the longitudinal DNA methylation profiling analysis find that the accumulation of epigenetic aging from COVID-19 syndrome could be partly reversed at late clinic phases in some patients.

RESULTS Cholecystectomy and sigmoidectomy LESS surgery were performed on 190 and 29 patients, respectively. Three patients developed a trocar site hernia within a median follow-up time of 34.7 months. Eleven patients were obese, 20 had a history of abdominal surgery, and 20 had a preoperative umbilical hernia but none of them developed a trocar site hernia, neither did the 11 subsequently pregnant women. Significant association was found between preoperative umbilical hernia and early complications including incisional cellulitis and hematoma. CONCLUSIONS A rate of 1.4% of trocar site hernia was observed in our study population. This rate is similar to the one reported after conventional laparoscopy. Peri-umbilical incision, longer than that with conventional laparoscopy, allowed better preexisting hernia handling, made anatomical closing easier among obese patients, and facilitated specimen extraction thus limiting traumatic operations.","output":"Retrospective single-surgeon study of outcomes after laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy and sigmoidectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viral illnesses are associated with diverse neurological complications, including acute transverse myelitis (ATM).

Despite this, little is known about the health characteristics and pretravel healthcare of US international travelers, particularly those at higher risk of travel-associated illness. METHODS We formed a national consortium (Global TravEpiNet) of 18 US clinics registered to administer yellow fever vaccination. We collected data regarding demographic and health characteristics, destinations, purpose of travel, and pretravel healthcare from 13235 international travelers who sought pretravel consultation at these sites from January 2009 through January 2011. RESULTS The destinations and itineraries of Global TravEpiNet travelers differed from those of the overall population of US international travelers. The majority of Global TravEpiNet travelers were visiting low- or lower-middle-income countries, and Africa was the most frequently visited region. Seventy-five percent of travelers were visiting malaria-endemic countries, and 38% were visiting countries endemic for yellow fever. Fifty-nine percent of travelers reported 1 medical condition. Atovaquone/proguanil was the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug, and most travelers received an antibiotic for self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

To prevent such school and mental health-related problems, there is a timely need to develop preventive strategies and interventions to address potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on childrens mental health, especially in school settings. Results from previous child clinical research indicate that art-based therapies, including mindfulness-based art therapy, have shown promise to increase childrens well-being and reduce psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present pilot and feasibility study was to compare the impact of an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention, on mental health in elementary school children (N = 22), in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both interventions were group-based and delivered online and remotely. A pilot study using a randomized cluster design was implemented to evaluate and compare both interventions in relation to child anxiety, depression, inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance revealed a significant effect of the type of drawing intervention on levels of inattention, after controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the emotion-based directed drawing group showed lower inattention scores at post-test, when compared to participants in the mandala group. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses showed significant decreases in pre-to-post scores for levels of hyperactivity for the complete sample. CONCLUSION: Overall, results from this pilot and feasibility study showed that both an emotion-based directed drawing intervention and a mandala drawing intervention may be beneficial to improve mental health in elementary school children, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. From a feasibility standpoint, results indicate that the implementation of both interventions online and remotely, through a videoconference platform, is feasible and adequate in school-based settings.

Environmental adversity is key in youth suicidality, hence there is a need to study stressors that disproportionately impact Black youths. We aimed to disentangle the unique contribution of racial/ethnic discrimination from other adversities associated with childhood suicidal ideation and attempts (suicidality) across races. Method: We analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study that included a large, diverse sample of US children (N=11,235, mean age 10.9 years, 20.2% Black) phenotyped for environmental adversities including discrimination. Multivariate regression models tested the association of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination with suicidality, covarying for multiple confounders including other discrimination types (towards non-US born individuals; sexual orientation-based; weight-based). Matched analyses contrasted effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and racial identity on suicidality. Results: Black youths reported more discrimination and higher suicidality rates than non-Black youths. High racial/ethnic discrimination was positively associated with suicidality, adjusting for other discrimination types (odds ratio [OR]=2.6, 95%CI=2.1-3.2). Findings remained significant after adjusting for multiple suicidality risk factors. Once experienced, racial/ethnic discrimination was similarly associated with suicidality in White, Black, and Hispanic youths.

The employed CH3NH3PbI3-XClX material was used after its efficiency loss has been reached to a saturation point in photovoltaic devices. Each deposited layer was investigated from UV to the IR absorption spectrum for deepening study through UVCvis spectroscopy. In the sandwiched architecture possessing FTO/PEDOT: PSS/Perovskite/PC61BM/CdS/Au symmetry, the perovskite film has been employed as an absorbent layer, however, other layers participation also plays a key role. The resultant device yielded very good sensing performance because of the enhanced excitons generation which is attributed to the precise selection of the interfacial materials, e.g. CdS and PC61BM as an ETM and PEDOT: PSS as HTM. The impedance and capacitance of the devices within 0.01?200 kHz under varied UV and IR illumination intensities were investigated. Measurements showed that as the intensity of the light increased i.e., UV (0C200 W/m2) and IR (0C5800 W/m2), impedance decreased while capacitance increased. The current results are attributed to the increase in the concentration of charges i.e., electron-hole pairs generation depending on the built-in capacitance and frequency of the charges.","output":"A novel and stable ultraviolet and infrared intensity sensor in impedance/capacitance modes fabricated from degraded CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons play a pivotal role in innate immune response to virus infection. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was reported to function as a negative regulator of inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting activation of NF-&#954;B and MAPKs during bacterial infection, however, the role of SHP-1 in regulating type I interferons remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that knockout or knockdown of SHP-1 in macrophages promoted both HSV-1- and VSV-induced antiviral immune response. Conversely, overexpression of SHP-1 in L929 cells suppressed the HSV-1- and VSV-induced immune response; suppression was directly dependent on phosphatase activity. We identified a direct interaction between SHP-1 and TRAF3; the association between these two proteins resulted in diminished recruitment of CK1? to TRAF3 and inhibited its K63-linked ubiquitination; SHP-1 inhibited K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 by promoting dephosphorylation at Tyr116 and Tyr446. Taken together, our results identify SHP-1 as a negative regulator of antiviral immunity and suggest that SHP-1 may be a target for intervention in acute virus infection.","output":"SHP-1 suppresses the antiviral innate immune response by targeting TRAF3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dublin, Ireland, like most other large cities has undergone lockdown due to the outbreak of the coronavirus Ongoing physical distancing requirements, as cities reopens, has resulted in a collapse to transits capacity and ability to meet demand, forcing authorities to reimagine how people can travel in a pandemic/post-pandemic world For Dublin, campaigns have focused on encouraging those who can walk or cycle to use active transport options if they are close enough to their place of employment, when the city fully reopens The purpose of this is to ensure adequate physical distancing can occur while alleviating the pressure on public transport systems, thereby freeing up space for those who are unable to commute via active transport and for those beyond a range in which it is feasible Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin (TCD) is located in the city centre of Irelands capital Since less than 1% of staff drive to the campus and students arenot permitted to park on the campus, the University community has been working with Dublin City Council (DCC) to advance planning and built environment interventions to enable staff and students to safely return to work and education This paper presents the results of the Commuting to Trinity while Covid-19 Social Distancing is Required Travel Survey for TCD students and staff, conducted in June and July 2020 (n = 2653) Conducted to determine how staff and students would like to travel to TCD, when the campus fully reopens, it identifies which factors influence their mode choice and choice of working locations The Trinity University campus makes for an interesting case study as it allows us to understand how the reopening of a major employment, educational and cultural site within an urban area, which is primarily served by transit and active transport, can address physical distancing restrictions and decreased capacity of public transport","output":"Re-open our city and campus post-Covid: A case study of Trinity college Dublin, the University of Dublin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The identified non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) include circular RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, small interfering RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs, and transfer RNAs, etc Among them, long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and microRNAs are regulatory RNAs that have different functional mechanisms and were extensively participated in various biological processes Numerous research studies have found that circular RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs played their important roles in avian immune system during the infection of parasites, virus, or bacterium Here, we specifically review and expand this knowledge with current advances of circular RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs in the regulation of different avian diseases and discuss their functional mechanisms in response to avian diseases","output":"Epigenetic Regulation by Non-Coding RNAs in the Avian Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Huang et al. (2019) used their EpiRank algorithm, which emphasizes forward-and-backward commuter flow between homes and workplaces, to analyze the distribution patterns of two infectious diseases in Taiwan: the 2009-H1N1 influenza virus and the widespread emergence of the 2000-2008 type 71 enterovirus (EV). As this article was being prepared, the spreading mechanism of the novel coronavirus disease now designated as COVID-19 had yet to be identified, but according to the American Centers for Disease Control, its spreading mechanism and patterns are likely more similar to influenza than to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). To consider potential COVID-19 spatial patterns, we applied EpiRank to the 2003 SARS outbreak in north Taiwan for comparison with H1N1 and EV. SARS was found to be less contagious than H1N1 or EV, but with a significantly higher fatality rate. The characteristics of these diseases determined their specific spatial spreading patterns, as reflected in the different effects of forward and backward commuting movement. Our motivation is to highlight these differences and to illustrate EpiRank spatial patterns for the 2003 SARS outbreak for comparison with EpiRank-determined distributions for the H1N1 and EV outbreaks. Our results indicate that the daytime parameter (i.e., forward movement effect) range was slightly higher (0.5-0.55) for the SARS outbreak than for either the influenza (0.4-0.5) or EV (0.3-0.5) outbreaks, suggesting that the forward-and-backward movements of individuals between residential and core urban areas with concentrated populations were equally important regarding the spread of SARS. While COVID-19 might resemble either SARS or H1N1 in terms of spatial spreading, its daytime parameter is likely somewhere in-between, with backward movement being dominant (similar to H1N1) or with forward and backward movement being equally important (similar to SARS).

This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else with the same probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs, mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating the scale of the second peak after reopening.","output":"Contact Graph Epidemic Modelling of COVID-19 for Transmission and Intervention Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to systematically review total daily sedentary time in South Asian adults.

The transient polymer-metal interfacial friction characteristics are investigated using united-atom molecular dynamics in this study, which is under the boundary conditions of single sliding friction (SSF) and reciprocating sliding friction (RSF). It reflects the polymer-metal interaction under the conditions of initial compaction and ultrasonic vibration, so that the heat generation mechanism of ultrasonic plasticization microinjection molding (UPMIM) is explored. The contact mechanics, polymer segment rearrangement, and frictional energy transfer features of polymer-metal interface friction are investigated. The results reveal that, in both SSF and RSF modes, the sliding rate has a considerable impact on the dynamic response of the interfacial friction force, where the amplitude has a response time of about 0.6 ns to the friction. The high frequency movement of the polymer segment caused by dynamic interfacial friction may result in the formation of a new coupled interface. Frictional energy transfer is mainly characterized by dihedral and kinetic energy transitions in polymer chains. Our findings also show that the ultrasonic amplitude has a greater impact on polymer-metal interfacial friction heating than the frequency, as much as it does under ultrasonic plasticizing circumstances on the homogeneous polymer-polymer interface.

METHODS: We included the first 99 heart transplant recipients at participating centers with COVID-19 and followed patients until resolution. We collected baseline information, symptoms, laboratory studies, vital signs, and outcomes for included patients. The association of immunosuppression regimens at baseline with severe disease were compared using logistic regression, adjusting for age and time since transplant. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years, 25% were female, and 44% were white. The median time post-transplant to infection was 5.6 years. Overall, 15% died, 64% required hospital admission, and 7% remained asymptomatic. During the course of illness, only 57% of patients had a fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms were common. Tachypnea, oxygen requirement, elevated creatinine and inflammatory markers were predictive of severe course. Age 60 was associated with higher risk of death and the use of the combination of calcineurin inhibitor, antimetabolite, and prednisone was associated with more severe disease compared to the combination of calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite alone (adjusted OR=7.3, 95% CI 1.8-36.2).

The purpose of this study is to compare the 6-month response to oral glucose challenge in patients undergoing RYGB, duodenal switch (DS), and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). METHODS Thirty-eight patients meeting the NIH criteria for bariatric surgery who have reached the 6-month postoperative mark are the basis of this report. Preoperatively and at 6 months follow-up, patients underwent blood draw to determine levels of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, C peptide, and 2 h oral liquid glucose challenge test (OGTT). HOMA-IR and 1 to 2 h ratios of glucose and fasting to 1 h ratio of insulin were calculated. RESULTS All patients underwent a successful laparoscopic bariatric procedure (VSG =13, DS =13, and RYGB = 12). All operations reduced BMI, HgbA1c, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. HOMA IR and glucose tolerance improved with all procedures. In response to OGTT at 6 months, there was a 20-fold increase in insulin at 1 h in RYGB, which was not seen in DS. At 6 months, 1-h insulin was markedly lower in DS (p < .05), yet HbA1C was also lower in DS (p < .05). This resulted in 1- to 2-h glucose ratio of 1.9 for RYGB, 1.8 for VSG, and 1.3 for DS (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS All operations improve insulin sensitivity and decrease HgbA1c. Six-month weight loss was substantial in all groups between 22-29% excess body weight. RYGB results in marked rise in glucose following challenge with corresponding rise in 1-h insulin. VSG has a similar response to RYGB. In comparison, at 6 months following surgery, DS causes a much lower rise in 1-h insulin, with this difference being statistically significant at p < .05. As a result, DS results in a less abrupt reduction in blood glucose. Although 1-h insulin is lower, DS patients had the lowest HbA1C at 6 months (p < .05).

Cortical effects of VNS, manifesting as vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs), are thought to arise from activation of ascending cholinergic and noradrenergic systems. However, it is unknown whether those effects are modulated by brain state at the time of stimulation. In 2 freely behaving macaque monkeys, we delivered short trains of 5 pulses to the left cervical vagus nerve at different frequencies (5-300 Hz) while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from sites in contralateral prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas. Brain states were inferred from spectral components of LFPs and the presence of overt movement: active awake, resting awake, REM sleep and NREM sleep. VNS elicited VEPs in all sampled cortical areas. VEPs comprised early (<70 ms), intermediate (70-250 ms) and late (>250 ms) components. The magnitude of the intermediate and late components was largest during NREM sleep and smallest during wakefulness, whereas that of the early component was not modulated by brain state. VEPs during NREM were larger for stimuli delivered at the depolarized phase of ongoing delta oscillations. Higher pulsing frequencies generated larger VEPs. These short VNS trains did not affect brain state transitions during wakefulness or sleep. Our findings suggest that ongoing brain state modulates the evoked effects of VNS on cortical activity. This has implications for the role of ongoing cortical activity and brain state in shaping cortical responses to peripheral stimuli, for the modulation of vagal interoceptive signaling by cortical activity, and for the dose calibration of VNS therapies.","output":"Cortical Responses to Vagus Nerve Stimulation Are Modulated by Brain State in Nonhuman Primates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annual influenza epidemics continue to cause worldwide morbidity, mortality and societal disruption, especially among the aged residents of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs).

An intraoperative endoscopic assessment of the anastomosis allows immediate evaluation regarding bleeding and possible leakage. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of routine intraoperative endoscopy on postoperative complications. METHODS Since May 1999, data of all laparoscopic colon resections were collected in a prospective database. Since July 2007, we assessed every circular-stapled anastomosis with a flexible endoscope for bleeding, integrity of mucosa, and leakage. The patients with (+) and without (-) routine endoscopic assessment were compared regarding postoperative complications. RESULTS Group(-) consisted of 253 patients [133 male, 120 female; mean age, 60 years (25 to 86 y)] and group(+) consisted of 85 patients [44 male, 41 female; mean age, 62 years (22 to 87 y), P=not significant] In group(-), postoperative anastomotic bleeding was diagnosed in 11 patients (4.3%) and 7 (2.8%) of these patients required endoscopic assessment and clipping. In group(+), endoscopy showed anastomotic bleeding in 5 patients (5.9%) at the time of surgery, which required clipping. Anastomotic leak was observed in 2 patients (2.4%): in one patient the circular staple line was oversewn and in the other patient anastomosis was redone.

We sought to expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of O3 responsiveness using the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel, which contains more genetic diversity than previous inbred strain panels. We evaluated hallmark O3-induced respiratory phenotypes in 56 CC strains after exposure to filtered air or 2 ppm O3, and performed focused genetic analysis of variation in lung injury as measured by the total bronchoalveolar lavage protein concentration. Because animals were exposed in sex- and batch-matched pairs, we defined a protein response phenotype as the difference in lavage protein between the O3- and FA-exposed animal within a pair. The protein response phenotype was heritable, and QTL mapping revealed two novel loci on Chromosomes 10 (peak: 26.2 Mb; 80% CI: 24.6-43.6 Mb) and 15 (peak: 47.1 Mb; 80% CI: 40.2-54.9 Mb), the latter surpassing the 95% significance threshold.

In summary, we have shown that O3-induced lung injury is modulated by genetic variation and demonstrated the value of the CC for uncovering and dissecting gene-environment interactions.","output":"A novel gene-by-environment quantitative trait locus on mouse chromosome 15 underlies susceptibility to acute ozone-induced lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: In this study we tried to assess a possible correlation between the paediatric dermatological manifestations and the SARS-CoV-2, using for the first time 3 different tests. Method: From April to June 2020, minors with recent skin manifestations and symptoms of COVID-19, themselves or any of first-degree relatives, were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical information, and biological results including 3 types of SARS-CoV-2 tests [nasal PCR (systemic symptoms within the past 48 hours), serology (IgG, Abbott ARCHITECT), and IFN--ELISPOT-assay] were collected. Results: Thirty patients (20 boys, average 9.5 years) and 37 symptomatic first-degree relatives were enrolled. Seventeen patients presented with chilblains (Figure 1) occurring before (n = 2, average: 19 days), simultaneously (n = 2, 12%) or after systemic manifestations (60%, average: 22 days). Spontaneous resolution was complete in 27 days (10-50) in 11/17 patients. Elevated CRP and/or increased inflammatory cytokines were noted in 11 children (37%) including 8/17 with chilblains (47%): mostly TNF-, IL-1, type 1 IFN and IL-6. Biological inflammation was not correlated with time lapses from cutaneous or systemic symptoms to the blood test, or with severity of chilblains. The 3/3 PCR, the 10/10 IFN--ELISPOT-assay and the 15/16 serology were negative. Dicussion: A cytokine storm was described in adults with COVID-19 and in the paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-COV-2 infection: elevated CRP and IL-6 levels. The peak of incidence of COVID-19 and the reported chilblains occurred simultaneously. Only 1/16 serology in children with chilblains was positive. Its sensitivity varies from 100 to 85% in severe or mild symptomatic patients respectively. We confirmed the COVID-19 only once, using 3 different methods. This result might reflect the estimated prevalence of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 in the general French population. While epidemiological data, clinical manifestations and elevated cytokines level suggest an association with SARS-CoV-2, no evident link could have been made here.","output":"Immunological and virological profile of children with chilblain-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scientific paper is devoted to the analysis of problems and ways of sales system development in the conditions of deformation of commodity distribution of large manufacturers of vibro-pressed products in the market of the Russian south.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. The participants filled out a questionnaire (developed by using Google Forms) that contained descriptive characteristics, nutritional behaviors, sleep patterns, physical activity status, anthropometric measurements, COVID-19-related level of knowledge, and the questions of the CES-Depression Scale through e-mail or social media (WhatsApp). SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 120 adult individuals who completed an online survey between April and May 2020. RESULTS: It was determined that 29.1% of the individuals showed mild, 34.2% moderate, and 23.4% severe depression symptoms during the pandemic period. A significant relationship was found between gender, age and educational status, marital status, and depression levels of the individuals, respectively (&#967;2=35.292, &#967;2=103.46, &#967;2=24.524, &#967;2=86.208 p<0.05). The top three foods consumed most during the pandemic period are tea and coffee (66.6%), pastry (e.g. cake, cookie) (56.4%), and desserts (49.6%). During the pandemic period, 42.5% of the individuals stated that they slept more and 40.2% stated that there was no change in their sleep patterns. Daily physical activity durations were determined as 8.251.77 hours for sleep, 4.212.68 hours for lying down, 5.422.64 hours for sitting, and 6.164.82 hours for standing activities. CONCLUSION: It was determined that the individuals showed different levels of depression symptoms during the pandemic period.

This paper presents an interactive information system designed to support the implementation of an augmented reality application in the context of game-based learning. PlanetarySystemGO includes a location-based mobile augmented reality game designed to promote learning about the celestial bodies and planetary systems of the Universe, and a web application that interacts with the mobile device application. Besides face-to-face classes, this resource can also be used in online classes, which is very useful in social isolation situations as the ones caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it is the inclusion of the web application, with a back-office, in the information system that makes it possible to include curricula contents according to the grade level of students. Moreover, it is intended that teachers use the information system to include the contents they find appropriate to the grade level they teach. Therefore, it is crucial to provide their professional development to be able to use this resource. In this regard, a pilot study was conducted with teachers who participated in a STEM professional development programme in order to assess if the system is appropriate to be used by them. It is concluded that teachers found this resource relevant to motivate students to learn, and also acknowledged that the web application facilitated the introduction of appropriate curricula contents and also was useful to assess student performance during the game. Teachers need support, however, to implement these types of technologies which are not familiar to them. The necessary support can be provided through collaboration among the researchers and teachers in their schools. Besides engaging students to learn about celestial bodies, it is concluded that the information system can be used by teachers to introduce appropriate curricula contents and to be implemented in class.","output":"An Interactive Information System That Supports an Augmented Reality Game in the Context of Game-Based Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a necessary, rapid adjustment within the field of obstetrics.

COVID-19 is a systemic viral disease currently spreading as a pandemic. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE. OBJECTIVE: to acquire information on the impact of COVID-19 in SLE. METHODS: A 26-item anonymous questionnaire investigating demographics, SLE clinical features, COVID-19 diagnoses and changes in treatments and daily habits was administered to patients with SLE from three referral centres through www.surveymonkey.com over 10 days. Data from the survey were compared to those from published estimates about the general population. RESULTS: Four-hundred-seventeen patients responded to the survey. More than 60% of subjects complained of symptoms that are also associated to COVID-19. Fourteen COVID-19 diagnoses (five confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) were reported, in contrast to a 0.73% prevalence of confirmed cases in Lombardy. One hospitalisation was reported. Fever, anosmia, dry cough, a self-reported history of neuropsychiatric SLE and a recent contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases were more strongly associated with COVID-19, as were symptoms and lower compliance to behavioural preventive measures in patients contacts. No protective effect was seen in subjects on hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 morbidity might only moderately be increased in most patients with SLE, although limited information can be inferred on more severe cases. Hydroxychloroquine apparently seems not to confer protection to infection per se, although other beneficial roles cannot be excluded. Containment policies and behavioural preventive measures could have a major role in limiting the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SLE.","output":"COVID-19 in systemic lupus erythematosus: Data from a survey on 417 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactants are multipurpose products found in most sectors of contemporary industry.

Pet atoms are placed such that they optimally trace the surface of the original molecule with just 1/50th the original atom number and are joined with covalent bonds. Molecular dynamics simulations of pet molecules allow for efficient packing optimization, as well as the generation of realistic DNA/RNA conformations. This pet world can be expanded back to the all-atom representation to be explored and visualized with full details.

Therefore, SARS CoV-2 RdRp is considered as a promising target to cease virus replication. SARS CoV-2 polymerase shows high structural similarity to Hepatitis C Virus-1b genotype (HCV-1b) polymerase. Arising from the high similarity between SARS CoV-2 RdRp and HCV NS5B, we utilized the reported small-molecule binders to the palm subdomain of HCV NS5B (genotype 1b) to generate a high-quality DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark set and conducted a benchmarking analysis against HCV NS5B. The three highly cited and publicly available docking tools AutoDock Vina, FRED and PLANTS were benchmarked. Based on the benchmarking results and analysis via pROC-Chemotype plot, PLANTS showed the best screening performance and can recognize potent binders at the early enrichment. Accordingly, we used PLANTS in a prospective virtual screening to repurpose both the FDA-approved drugs (DrugBank) and the HCV-NS5B palm subdomain binders (BindingDB) for SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain. Further assessment by molecular dynamics simulations for 50 ns recommended diosmin (from DrugBank) and compound 3 (from BindingDB) to be the best potential binders to SARS CoV-2 RdRp palm subdomain.

Probiotics main mechanisms of action include enhanced mucosal barrier function, direct antagonism with pathogens, inhibition of bacterial adherence and invasion capacity in the intestinal epithelium, boosting of the immune system and regulation of the central nervous system. It is accepted that there is a mutual communication between the gut microbiota and the liver, the so-called \\"microbiota-gut-liver axis\\" as well as a reciprocal communication between the intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system through the \\"microbiota-gut-brain axis.\\" Moreover, recently the \\"gut-lung axis\\" in bacterial and viral infections is considerably discussed for bacterial and viral infections, as the intestinal microbiota amplifies the alveolar macrophage activity having a protective role in the host defense against pneumonia. The importance of the normal human intestinal microbiota is recognized in the preservation of health. Disease states such as, infections, autoimmune conditions, allergy and other may occur when the intestinal balance is disturbed. Probiotics seem to be a promising approach to prevent and even reduce the symptoms of such clinical states as an adjuvant therapy by preserving the balance of the normal intestinal microbiota and improving the immune system. The present review states globally all different disorders in which probiotics can be given. To date, Stronger data in favor of their clinical use are provided in the prevention of gastrointestinal disorders, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergy and respiratory infections. We hereby discuss the role of probiotics in the reduction of the respiratory infection symptoms and we focus on the possibility to use them as an adjuvant to the therapeutic approach of the pandemic COVID-19. Nevertheless, it is accepted by the scientific community that more clinical studies should be undertaken in large samples of diseased populations so that the assessment of their therapeutic potential provide us with strong evidence for their efficacy and safety in clinical use.","output":"Probiotics in Medicine: A Long Debate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is estimated that human body is inhabited by approximately 380 trillions of viruses, which exist in the form of viral communities and are collectively termed as human virome. How virome is assembled and what kind of forces maintain the composition and diversity of viral communities is still an open question. The question is of obvious importance because of its implications to human health and diseases.

It was found that stochastic neutral drifts seem prevalent: approximately 65C92% at metacommunity/landscape scales and 67C80% at virus species scale. The non-neutral selection is approximately 26C28% at community scale and 23% at species scale. The false negative rate is about 2C3%, which suggested rather limited confounding effects of non-neutral process on neutrality tests.

The next important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. FQHC clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care. Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome. The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0 mmHg difference in systolic BP at a 0.05 significance level and 80% follow-up rate.

OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the experiences and views of bereaved motor neurone disease caregivers with Motor Neurone Disease Associations about service gaps and needed improvements before and during bereavement and to propose a model of care that fits with consumer preferences and where Motor Neurone Disease Associations are effective enablers of care. METHODS: A national bereavement survey was facilitated in 2019 by all Motor Neurone Disease Associations in Australia. A total of 363 respondents completed the section on support provided by Motor Neurone Disease Associations. A mixed-method design was used. RESULTS: Respondents were generally positive about support received before bereavement (73-76%), except for emotional support (55%). Positive experiences related to the following: information, equipment advice/provision, advocacy/linking to services, showing empathy/understanding, personal contact and peer social support. Negative experiences included lack of continuity in case management and contact, perceived lack of competence or training, lack of emotional support and a lack of access to motor neurone disease services in rural areas. Suggested improvements were as follows: more contact and compassion at end of life and postdeath; better preparation for end of life; option of discussing euthanasia; providing referrals and links for counseling; access to caregiver support groups and peer interaction; provision of a genuine continuum of care rather than postdeath abandonment; guidance regarding postdeath practicalities; and more access to bereavement support in rural areas. CONCLUSION: This study provides consumer perspectives on driving new or improved initiatives by Motor Neurone Disease Associations and the need for a national standardised approach to training and service delivery, based on research evidence.

We reviewed experimental findings from human primary cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, as well as those from animal studies, so as to understand the pathogenesis and high case-fatality of MERS. Human respiratory epithelial cells are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can support productive viral replication. However, the induction of antiviral cytokines and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are substantially dampened in the infected epithelial cells, due to the antagonistic mechanisms evolved by the virus. MERS-CoV can readily infect and robustly replicate in human macrophages and dendritic cells, triggering the aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. MERS-CoV can also effectively infect human primary T cells and induce massive apoptosis in these cells. Although data from clinical, in vitro and ex vivo studies suggested the potential for virus dissemination, extrapulmonary involvement in MERS patients has not been ascertained due to the lack of autopsy study. In MERS-CoV permissive animal models, although viral RNA can be detected from multiple organs of the affected animals, the brain of human DPP4-transgenic mouse was the only extrapulmonary organ from which the infectious virus can be recovered.

The athletes were equipped with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna, a heart rate monitor, and a dedicated multisensor inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to a ski, which recorded spatial-temporal gait parameters and transition events. The athletes' GNSS and heart rate data were synchronized with the IMU data. Athlete #1 had a baseline VO(2) max of 80 ml/min/kg, a maximum heart rate of 205 bpm, weighed 69 kg, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 21.3 kg/m(2). During the race, he carried 6 kg of gear and kept his heart rate constant around 85% of max. Spatiotemporal parameters analysis highlighted his ability to sustain higher power, higher pace, and, thus, higher vertical velocity than the other athletes. He made longer steps by gliding longer at each step and performed less kick turns in a shorter time. He spent only a cumulative 5 min and 30 s during skins on and off transitions. Skimo performance, thus, requires a high aerobic power of which a high fraction can be maintained for a prolonged time. Our results further confirm earlier observations that speed of ascent during endurance skimo competitions is a function of body weight and race gear and vertical energy cost of locomotion, with the latter function of climbing gradient.

The results remain robust to various sensitivity and endogeneity tests and after controlling for different non-economic and institutional factors. The ESR captures diverse conditions, which may amplify or contain the contagion of epidemiological risk, and therefore it could potentially be a useful tool for predicting and managing epidemic outbreaks and their consequences on business sustainability. ? 2021 British Academy of Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC","output":"Epidemiological Susceptibility Risk, Adaptive Management and Firm Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Despite past and ongoing efforts to achieve health equity in the United States, persistent disparities in socioeconomic status along with multilevel racism maintain disparate outcomes and appear to be amplified by COVID-19. Objective Measure socioeconomic factors and primary language effects on the risk of COVID-19 severity across and within racial/ethnic groups. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in the U.S. between March 4, 2020 to August 19, 2020. Participants PCR+ COVID-19 patients. Patients missing race or ethnicity data or those diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospitalization were excluded. Exposures Main exposures included race/ethnicity, area deprivation index (ADI), and primary language. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis. Logistic and competing-risk regression models (censored at 45 days and accounting for the competing risk of death prior to hospitalization) assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. Results 5,577 COVID-19 patients were included, 866 (n=15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 years, IQR: 45.7-75.9 vs. 40.4 years, IQR: 25.6-58.3, p<0.001) and more likely to be male (n=425 [49.1%] vs. 2,049 [43.5%], p=0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n=381), 19.9% (n=172), 18.6% (n=161), and 11.8% (n=102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity; Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). Surprisingly ADI was not associated with hospitalization; however, consistent trends within racial/ethnic groups were observed. Furthermore, non-English speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. Conclusions Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes during the pandemic. Non-English speaking also accounts for between and within minority populations. These results support continued concern that racism contributes to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity across and within minority groups.","output":"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospital Admissions from COVID-19 and Determining the Impact of Neighborhood Deprivation and Primary Language."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most previous studies on aerosols have focused on the role of aerosols in the transmission of human and animal pathogens; however, little is known about the role of aerosols in the transmission of plant bacterial disease.

Although rare, this condition carries a high mortality rate and no current standardised guidelines for management. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a patient in their 60s with recurrent small bowel obstruction secondary to a cholecysto-duodenal fistula and large gallstone which became impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. The patient had a P-POSSUM Score of 14% mortality and 60% morbidity risk, had multiple co-morbidities, was bedbound, BMI 59 and had been deemed high risk for general anaesthetic at oncology centre for a 10  10 cm likely gynaecological malignancy a month prior to this admission. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: In contrast to existing literature, endoscopic lithotripsy was considered but not attempted due to unavailability of this service locally. Surgical intervention was decided based on radiological features of impending duodenal perforation on CT imaging and multiple disciplinary team discussion. The patient was managed with open enterolithotomy at the duodeno-jejunal (DJ) flexure and discharged 3 weeks post-operatively at her pre-operative baseline. CONCLUSION: This is the first report to our knowledge to describe successful surgical management of a gallstone impacted in the fourth part of the duodenum. In cases where anatomical location of impaction precludes retrieval via simple gastrostomy, we suggest using high pressure flush to mobilise the stone to more favourable location distally. We emphasise that stone size should be considered when planning surgical management.","output":"Bouveret syndrome: A challenging case of impacted gallstone within the fourth part of the duodenum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication are unknown, and this aspect of the virus life cycle is not understood. It is thought that virus-encoded nonstructural proteins and RNA genomes interact on rearranged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to form replication complexes, which are believed to be sites of RNA synthesis. We report that, through the use of an antibody specific for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), dsRNA is readily detectable in Huh-7 cells that contain replicating HCV JFH-1 genomes but is absent in control cells. Therefore, as that of other RNA virus genomes, the replication of the HCV genome may involve the generation of a dsRNA replicative intermediate. In Huh-7 cells supporting HCV RNA replication, dsRNA was observed as discrete foci, associated with virus-encoded NS5A and core proteins and identical in morphology and distribution to structures containing HCV RNA visualized by fluorescence-based hybridization methods. Three-dimensional reconstruction of deconvolved z-stack images of virus-infected cells provided detailed insight into the relationship among dsRNA foci, NS5A, the ER, and lipid droplets (LDs). This analysis revealed that dsRNA foci were located on the surface of the ER and often surrounded, partially or wholly, by a network of ER-bound NS5A protein. Additionally, virus-induced dsRNA foci were juxtaposed to LDs, attached to the ER. Thus, we report the visualization of HCV-induced dsRNA foci, the likely sites of virus RNA replication, and propose that HCV genome synthesis occurs at LD-associated sites attached to the ER in virus-infected cells.","output":"Visualization of double-stranded RNA in cells supporting hepatitis C virus RNA replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNSTRUCTURED: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) management can be challenging for children and their families.

The aim of this study was to assess whether telemedicine (using iPads) reduced PPE use in emergency department (ED) patients who were treated in contact isolation, and whether telemedicine had a positive effect on patient anxiety and satisfaction. METHODS We conducted a prospective single centre before-and-after study including ED patients 18 years who were treated in contact isolation. PPE use, the Hospital Anxiety Scale and the 15-item Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire were compared between the control period (8 April to 14 April 2020) and intervention period (15 April to 24 April 2020). RESULTS We included 25 patients in each period. PPE use per patient was higher for physicians in the control period (mean 1.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9) compared with the intervention period (mean 1.2; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.3, p<0.01). Total PPE use per patient contact for ED physicians decreased from 42 out of 42 patient contacts in the control period, to 29 out of 66 patient contacts in the intervention period (difference 54.3%; 95% CI 50.1% to 58.6%, p<0.01). Reported anxiety and satisfaction were not significantly different. CONCLUSION PPE use by physicians can successfully be reduced by using telemedicine in the ED without increasing anxiety or dissatisfaction.

The inventory of Rh and K antigen-negative red cell units recommended for patients with hemoglobinopathies became alarmingly low and continues to be strained. Because patients with sickle cell disease requiring chronic red cell exchange (RCE) incur a large demand for red cell units, we hypothesized that implementation of 2 measures could reduce blood use. First, obtaining the pretransfusion hemoglobin S (HbS) results by procedure start time would facilitate calculation of exact red cell volume needed to achieve the desired post-RCE HbS. Second, as a short-term conservation method, we identified patients for whom increasing the targeted end procedure hematocrit up to 5 percentage points higher than the pretransfusion level (no higher than 36%) was not medically contraindicated. The goal was to enhance suppression of endogenous erythropoiesis and thereby reduce the red cell unit number needed to maintain the same target HbS%. These 2 measures resulted in an 18% reduction of red cell units transfused to 50 patients undergoing chronic RCE during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite reduction of blood use, pretransfusion HbS% target goals were maintained and net iron accumulation was low. Both strategies can help alleviate a shortage of Rh and K antigen-negative red cells, and, more generally, transfusing red cell units based on precise red cell volume required can optimize patient care and judicious use of blood resources.","output":"Measures to reduce red cell use in patients with sickle cell disease requiring red cell exchange during a blood shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare industry is commonly compared to the aviation industry with emphasis on human factors and the decision-making processes undertaken by pilots and clinicians alike.

Plastics in terms of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other single-use medical equipment along with packaging solutions owing to their inherent properties have emerged as a life-savior for protecting the health and safety of the frontline health workers and the common citizens during the pandemic. However, plastics have been deemed as evil polluter due to their indiscriminate littering and mismanagement amid increased plastic usage and waste generation during this unprecedented crisis. This article reviews and assesses to dwell upon whether plastics in the time of pandemic are acting as protector of the public health or polluter of the environment. Considering the utilities and limitations of plastic along with its management or mismanagement, and the fate, an equitable appraisal suggests that the consumers' irresponsible behavior, and attitude and poor awareness, and the stress on waste management infrastructure in terms of collection, operation, and financial constraints as the major drivers, leading to mismanagement, turn plastic into an evil polluter of the environment. Plastic can be a protector if managed properly and complemented by the circular economy strategies in terms of reduction, recycle and recovery, and thereby preventing leakage into the environment. To safeguard the supply chain of PPEs, several decontamination techniques have been adopted worldwide ensuring their effective reprocessing to prioritize the circular economy within the system. Policy guidelines encouraging to adopt safer practices and sustainable technical solutions along with consumers' education for awareness creation are the need of the hour for preventing plastic to turn from protector with high utility to polluter.","output":"Plastics in the time of COVID-19 pandemic: Protector or polluter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe expected changes in a mirror-image prone electrocardiogram (ECG) compared with normal supine, including a range of cardiac conditions. BACKGROUND: Unwell COVID-19 patients are at risk of cardiac complications. Prone ventilation is recommended but poses practical challenges to acquisition of a 12-lead ECG. The effects of prone positioning on the ECG remain unknown. METHODS: 100 patients each underwent 3 ECGs: standard supine front (SF); prone position with precordial leads attached to front (PF); and prone with precordial leads attached to back in a mirror image to front (PB). RESULTS: Prone positioning was associated with QTc prolongation (PF 437  32 ms vs. SF 432  31 ms; p < 0.01; PB 436  34 ms vs. SF 432  31 ms; p = 0.02). In leads V(1) to V(3) on PB ECG, a qR morphology was present in 90% and changes in T-wave polarity in 84%. In patients with anterior ischemia, ST-segment changes in V(1) to V(3) on supine ECG were no longer visible on PB in 100% and replaced by an R wave in V(1). Bundle branch block (BBB) remained detectable in 100% on PB, with left BBB appearing as right BBB on PB in 71% and QRS narrowing with qR in V(1) for right BBB. ST-segment/T-wave changes in limb leads and arrhythmia detection were largely unaffected in PB. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the PB ECG is unreliable for the detection of anterior myocardial injury but remains useful for ST-segment/T-wave abnormalities in limb leads, BBB detection, and rhythm monitoring. The prone ECG is a useful screening tool with diagnostic utility in COVID-19 patients who require prone ventilation.","output":"Prone and Supine 12-Lead ECG Comparisons: Implications for Cardiac Assessment During Prone Ventilation for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Having cancer in childhood is a risk factor for separation anxiety symptoms, with negative effects on the disease and psychological wellbeing. The Covid-19-pandemic-related concerns could have a negative effect. The present study explores the interplay between separation anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-related worries in pediatric cancer patients and their mothers, compared to a group of healthy children and their mothers, during the pandemic. Thirty-three subjects with cancer, aged 7C15 years, and their mothers were compared to a control sample of 36 healthy children and caregivers. They were administered a pandemic-related psychological experience survey and standardized questionnaires assessing psychological wellbeing, anxiety, and separation anxiety symptoms. Children with cancer reported significantly higher prosocial behaviors, fear of being alone, and fear of abandonment. Their mothers had worse psychological wellbeing, higher COVID-19 concerns, anxiety, and separation anxiety symptoms. The multiple linear regression model showed that an increase in childrens separation anxiety symptoms was associated with younger age, more recent diagnosis, more mother-child time, lower mothers worry for childrens contagion, and higher mothers and childrens anxiety. COVID-19-related worries of clinical childrens mothers seem to be protective for childrens psychological wellbeing.

Aims: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in adult patients with congenital heart disease in our tertiary centre Methods: Adult patients seen at the CHD outpatient's clinic at a tertiary centre, who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection up to February 2021 were included. Assessment of patients' symptoms, need for hospitalization and admission in an intensive care unit was assessed based on medical records. Results: We identified 36 patients (pts) with COVID-19 infection. Symptoms were present in 31 (86%). The median age was 39 (32-49) years, 58% were females. Seven P (19%) had complex cyanotic disease;three (8%) Tetralogy of Fallot;three (8%) transposition of great arteries (one after Senning procedure and 2 after arterial switch);six (14%) right ventricle obstacle;two (8%) atrioventricular canal defect;four (11%) atrial septal defect;five (14%) ventricular septal defect;five (14%) aortic coarctation;two aortopathies (one submitted do David procedure);one subaortic stenosis;two (6%) had Eisenmenger syndrome. The majority (61%) of P had previous surgery and 58% were at New York Heart Association class of I. Mild symptoms were reported by 24 P (67%).

In this study, a randomized active-controlled clinical trial was performed to verify the efficacy and safety of ZJP in detail. METHODS: Patients with CNG were divided into the ZJP group and the Marzulene-S granule group. Patients were enrolled from September 2019 to February 2021 (ChiCTR2000040549). Endoscopy and histology scores were evaluated as the primary outcome measure. The Helicobacter pylori positive rate and the disappearance rate of symptoms were also measured to reflect the outcomes. Finally, adverse events were also calculated as the index of safety. RESULTS: A total of 68 eligible patients were enrolled in this trial and randomly divided into two groups with baseline comparability. ZJP was able to improve the red plaques as well as bile reflux scores compared with Marzulene-S granule (P=0.043 and P=0.019, respectively).

Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 have shown efficacy decreasing infection rates, with efficacy rates of 50-95%. However, the immunogenicity in immune-compromised patients, particularly those with prior exposure to anti-CD20 antibodies and duration of protective immunity, remains unknown. The current guidelines recommend vaccination for all patients receiving cancer therapy with a 3 months delay following hematological stem cell transplant and CAR-T cell therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with hematological malignancies following anti-CD20 therapy. Adult patients, 18 years and older, with frontline and relapsed hematological malignancies were included. We performed a chart review to obtain treatment responses and analyze the correlation between clinical, biological, and demographic characteristics and antibody titer responses. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measure by qualitative IgG antibody analysis, SARS-CoV-2 Semi-Quantitative total antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody spike. Comparative analysis of response with a control group of patients with hematological malignancies with no prior exposure to anti-CD20 therapy was performed. Results: A total of 29 patients (pts) were included. Twenty-five pts (86%) were >65 years, with a median age of 73 years (49-93). Most patients were female (52%) with a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) (86%). Twenty-four (83%) had rituximab therapy, and six pts (21%) had received Obinutuzumab. Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. Seventeen pts had completed treatment by the time of vaccination (59%), included 16 pts (55%) without any anti-CD20 therapy in the last 12 months. Four pts (14%) had common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Most pts received the Pfizer vaccine (83%), while 6% were given the Moderna vaccine and 3% J&J vaccine. The median time from last anti-CD20 therapy and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was 13 months (0-156). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following vaccination were assessed after a median of 1.6 months (range 0.2-5 months). Overall a total of 44 measurements were done with a median of 1 assessment per patient (range 1-3). With a median follow-up of 1.6 months from completion of vaccination, the overall response rate was 35%, with response rates of 24% for recent anti-CD20 exposure (< 12 months) vs. 44% for patients with no exposure in the last 12 months. Response rates are listed in Figure 1.Figure 2 compares antibody titers distribution among hematological malignancy pts with a history of anti-CD20 therapy vs. the control group. The median SARS COV2 IgG Spike titers were 0.9 for the anti-CD20 subgroup vs. 4.9 in the control group (P=0.02). Only two patients had sequential vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines; however, neither developed antibodies despite re-vaccination. We did not identify any pts with a production of late antibody titers among pts with prior anti-CD20 exposure. Response rates were significantly decreased among pts with prior anti-CD20 exposure with ORR 35% vs. 65% for pts with hematological malignancies without anti-CD20 treatment (P=0.002) We performed univariate analysis to determine the clinical factors associated with increased response rates. We found that decreased ALC counts were associated with decreased responses, while patients with no anti-CD20 therapy in the last 24 months were more likely to respond. There were no cases of COVID-19 infection following vaccination irrespective of titer responses. Conclusions: While SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has shown to be effective and induces response rates from 50-95%, we found decreased response rates among immunocompromised cancer patients, particularly among those with anti-CD20 therapy. Responses were associated with absolute lymphocyte count and time from monoclonal therapy, with patients with normal levels and no therapy for over two years most likely to respond. However, despite low response rates, there were no cases of COVID-19 infection in our study. Further, follow-up is needed to determine the duration of response and persistence of antibodies.

Unfortunately, young patients are often outside the remit of these adult clinics, and often experience major gaps and delays to the patient pathway, with a lack of coordination in areas such as hormone replacement therapy, psychological & educational support and fertility counselling. Based on this, a national survey was carried out to assess the needs of young (16-20) Klinefelter Syndrome patients which led to the setting up a young person's KSMDT clinic model for KS. We report on the patient and clinician reported feedback in the first 6 months of this clinic. The structure of the pilot young person's KSMDT clinic included input from endocrinologists, a fertility team of urologists & reproductive medicine doctors, a psychology team involving both clinical and educational psychology, a neurodisability team, genetics specialists as well as a specialist pharmacist and a patient liaison. Each consult was specifically structured to the patient's priorities, with both the patient and parent invited to attend and to separately indicate these priorities. Ten patients (mean age 17, range 16 C 20) were seen in the first clinic. To assess the quality of care received in the clinic, an 8 -point feedback questionnaire was given to each patient & parent attending the clinic to fill out at the end of the clinic. The form included a space for feedback for each speciality involved. The feedback forms were reviewed by 2 individual researchers and entries were assessed using an adapted Likert scale (0 C 5). Clinicians involved in the clinic were also encouraged to attend and rate the other specialties, the effectiveness of MDT clinic. All patients & parents were satisfied about the structure of clinic, the provision and management plans. 94% of patients indicated they were very satisfied (score = 5) about endocrine consultation compared to 100%, 90% and 88% in genetic, neurodisability/psychology and fertility consultations respectively. Key factors influencing these positive results included the presence of detailed fertility counseling, access to patient support groups and having a transition plan to the adult KSMDT clinic. Clinician feedback was positive with all members agreeing that the pre and post clinic MDTs allowed effective discussion of complex issues such as hormone initiation, future fertility as well as socio-educational factors affecting the well-being of the patient. The overall patient and clinician feedback for the young person's KSMDT clinic was uniformly positive, with the multispecialty approach allowing communication with and between all relevant specialities on the same day, avoiding the need to come for multiple separate appointments across different sites (especially relevant during the Covid era). A fully fledged clinic is now running based on the feedback and insight provided from the pilot process, with a seamless transition of these young patients to our adult KSMDT clinic to continue to support them.

Adolescent heart failure (HF) and heart transplant (HT) recipients report higher prevalence of mood symptoms compared to general adolescent population. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes in Adolescent HF and HT recipients remains unknown. Methods Electronic Mental Health Screens, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were administered at quarterly intervals to patients aged 11 years and older presenting for ambulatory HF and HT care at our center. Screening results from August 2020- February 2021 (COVID Screen) were compared to results from August 2019- March 2020 (Pre-COVID Screen). When multiple Pre-COVID screens were available, the one closest to pandemic start date (April 2020) was used and in case of multiple COVID screens, the one completed during the peak of COVID wave (November-January 2021) was used. Results Demographic data for 37 patients with paired screens is summarized in Table 1. There was a significant increase in mean GAD-7 score, 2.51 (2.98) Pre-COVID to 3.76 (4.99) during COVID (p=0.04) and no significant change in mean PHQ-9 score, 2.73 (3.71) Pre-COVID to 4.05 (4.83) during COVID (p=0.06). Although there was no significant difference in Pre-COVID screen scores by age or race, the COVID Screen scores were significantly higher for younger adolescents and Black patients for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (Table 1). Nine patients (24.3%) were receiving treatment for mood disorders pre-COVID and 11 (29.7%) during COVID (p=0.50). Conclusion Adolescents with HF and HT reported worsening anxiety symptoms during COVID similar to the worsening mental health trends for young adults noted nationwide. Younger and Black adolescents with HF or HT reported worse anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic compared to other demographics.","output":"Worsening Mental Health in Adolescent Heart Failure and Transplant Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, varies from mild to severe respiratory illness. Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. ProteinCprotein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"D155Y substitution of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a weakens binding with Caveolin-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While suicide rates in high- and middle-income countries appeared stable in the early stages of the pandemic, we know little about within-country variations. We sought to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide in Mexicos 32 states and to identify factors that may have contributed to observed variations between states. Methods: Interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from Jan 1, 2010, to March 31, 2020), comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number for the remainder of the year (April 1 to December 31, 2020) for each of Mexicos 32 states. Next, we modeled state-level trends using linear regression to study likely contributing factors at ecological level. Results: Suicide increased across Mexico during the first nine months of the pandemic (RR 1.03;95%CI 1.01-1.05). Suicides remained stable in 19 states, increase in seven states (RR range: 1.12-2.04) and a decrease in six states (RR range: 0.46-0.88). Suicide RR at the state level was positively associated with population density in 2020 and state level suicide death rate in 2019. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had a differential effect on suicide death within the 32 states of Mexico. Higher population density and higher suicide rates in 2019 were associated with increased suicide. As the country struggles to cope with the ongoing pandemic, efforts to improve access to primary care and mental health care services (including suicide crisis intervention services) in these settings should be given priority.","output":"A State Level Analyses of Suicide and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has struggled to answer a critical question: why would people share fake news if they have no intention to deceive, and they run a risk of social censure for doing so? Working on the basis that sharers do not know whether the news is fake, we propose the term \\"dubious news\\" to help answer that question. The term describes news which exists in two states simultaneously, both true and false until it has been established which it is. People who would be reluctant to knowingly share fake news might nonetheless share dubious news. Focus groups run in Singapore during the early stages of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic - when uncertainty ran high - explored why people share dubious news, its value in establishing truth, and its impact on group cohesion. We identify a difference between the motivation of the sharer and how that motivation is perceived by a recipient, which further illustrates the distinction between dubious and fake news. We conclude that, despite the potential for discord in the group and censure for the individual, dubious news may still perform social functions like that of rumour: group cohesion;personal status;and a sense of control in situations of uncertainty.","output":"Dubious News: The Social Processing of Uncertain Facts in Uncertain Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging data indicate that gastrointestinal disorders, in addition to pulmonary dysfunction, are also hallmarks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

After treatment for SARS-CoV-2, his respiratory condition improved. However, he developed right upper quadrant pain with elevated inflammatory markers (white blood cells, 21,160/L; c-reactive protein, 163.9 mg/L) on the 13th day. Abdominal computed tomography revealed acute acalculous cholecystitis. Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) was performed together with antibiotic therapy, which resulted in improvement of symptoms. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed 36 days after PTGBD. CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) following pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Design/methodology/approach: In the spring of 2020, global clothing retailers were advised or ordered to close physical stores due to lockdown measures of the COVID-19 pandemic and many supply chains temporarily halted production. This paper explains how pre-pandemic modern slavery advancements will be detrimentally affected as a result of societal lockdowns and apparel retail closures around the world. Findings: Two consequences of lockdowns are highlighted, which will have negative implications on modern slavery progress. These are the exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes higher exploitation of those already involved in modern slavery and increased risk of exploitation for those susceptible to being drawn (back) into modern slavery and;the need for repetition of previous work completed by external stakeholders or in some cases, a better alternative. Practical implications: The pandemic itself causes friction between immediate response solutions and long-term modern slavery goals. Social implications: In response to modern slavery drivers, governments may need to fill governance gaps, to control the power of corporations and to reconsider migration regulation. Originality/value: The COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent supply chain disruptions were unforeseen. This paper argues that there are significant negative effects on the developments in modern slavery eradication made in the past 10 years. As businesses struggled for basic survival, the apparel manufacturing sector has been detrimentally affected as upstream labourers are now at higher risk from the increased likelihood of modern slavery violations. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"The outlook for modern slavery in the apparel sector in a post-lockdown economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic responses can engender healthier and more sustainable societies only if we attend to urban equality","output":"Seeing COVID-19 through an urban lens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A strong public health workforce (PHW) is needed to respond to COVID\\\\19 and public health (PH) issues worldwide.

This article addresses the importance of enacting crisis standards of care (CSC) as a policy mechanism to facilitate the shift to population-based medicine. In times of emergencies and crises such as this pandemic, the enactment of CSC enables concrete decisions to be made by governments relating to supply chains, resource allocation and provision of care to maximize societal benefit. This shift from an individual to a population-based societal focus has profound consequences on how clinical decisions are made at the point of care. Failing to enact CSC may have psychological impacts for healthcare providers particularly related to moral distress, through an inability to fully enact individual beliefs (individually focused clinical decisions) which form their moral compass.","output":"Crisis standards of care in a pandemic: navigating the ethical, clinical, psychological and policy-making maelstrom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis in Spain has exacerbated the shortage of nursing staff to respond to increasing healthcare demands. For this reason, nursing students were requested to collaborate voluntarily as auxiliary health staff. This emergency has led to mental health problems in health professionals, hence the relevance of coping techniques. The objectives of this study were to explore the experiences and emotional responses of final-year nursing students who volunteered to carry out healthcare relief tasks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the coping strategies they adopted to deal with this situation. A qualitative study was conducted in the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used, and twenty-two students participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then content-analysed. The study is reported using the COREQ checklist. Five themes emerged in the 'Experiences and emotional response' dimension (context, patients, emotions and feelings, risk of contagion, and personal satisfaction), and three themes emerged in the 'Coping strategies' dimension strategies in the work environment, in daily life and personal life. Although the students expressed negative emotions due to the highly complex context and lack of professional experience, they evaluated the experience positively in terms of learning and usefulness.

It is a structure that maintains order through self-organization, characterized by a high level of dynamism, which in turn is characterized by work. For this work to take place, a continuous high flow of energy is necessary. However, a focused view of the physical relationship between energy and work is inadequate for describing complex biological/medical mechanisms or systems. In this review, we try to make a connection between the fundamental laws of physics and the mechanisms and functions of biology, which are characterized by self-organization. Many different physical work processes (work) in human cells are called cell work and can be grouped into five forms: synthetic, mechanical, electrical, concentration, and heat generation cell work. In addition to the flow of energy, these cell functions are based on fundamental processes of self-organization that we summarize with the term Entirety of molecular interaction (EoMI). This illustrates that cell work is caused by numerous molecular reactions, flow equilibrium, and mechanisms. Their number and interactions are so complex that they elude our perception in their entirety. To be able to describe cell functions in a biological/medical context, the parameters influencing cell work should be summarized in overarching influencing variables. These are biological energy, information, matter, and cell mechanics (EMIM). This makes it possible to describe and characterize the cell work involved in cell systems (e.g., respiratory chain, signal transmission, cell structure, or inheritance processes) and to demonstrate changes. If cell work and the different influencing parameters (EMIM influencing variables) are taken as the central property of the cell, specific gene mutations cannot be regarded as the sole cause for the initiation and progression of cancer. This reductionistic monocausal view does not do justice to the dynamic and highly complex system of a cell. Therefore, we postulate that each of the EMIM influencing variables described above is capable of changing the cell work and thus the order of a cell in such a way that it can develop into a cancer cell.","output":"Origin of Cancer: Cell work is the Key to Understanding Cancer Initiation and Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: One important group of people at higher risk from the COVID-19 pandemic are those with autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis/inflammatory bowel disease. To minimise infection risk, many people are now being switched from intravenous to subcutaneous biologics including biosimilars. A key question is how transition costs are viewed by clinicians. Design The survey was designed to understand the comparative economic issues related to the intravenous infusion vs subcutaneous biologic administration routes for infliximab. The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored. Setting/Participants Semi structured telephone interviews were carried out with twenty key stakeholders across the NHS from clinical/pharmacy/commissioning roles. The interviews were undertaken virtually 5thApril-27thApril 2020 and included a semi-structured interview framework with questions across the two administration routes. Results From interview results a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. Key findings included evidence of significant variation in infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% that of infusion, with a most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times and reduced risk of COVID-19 infection plus reduced patient costs. However, this was to some extent offset by increased pressure on home-care and community/primary care services. Conclusions Switching from infusion to subcutaneous routes is currently being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in many services. A case for biologics (infusion vs subcutaneous) must be made on accurate real-world economic analysis. In an analysis of direct/indirect costs, excluding medicine acquisition costs, subcutaneous administration appears to be the more cost saving option for many patients even without the benefit of industry funded home-care.","output":"Comparing cost of intravenous infusion and subcutaneous biologics in COVID-19 pandemic care pathways -- A brief UK stakeholder survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) was seriously affected by the 4(th) COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to provide mental health care services for people through a psychological intervention model, called PSYCARE.

METHODS: The entire workflow was implemented in the three steps under the leadership of the Ho Chi Minh City government: (1) Preparation and mobilization, (2) Multidisciplinary team establishment, and (3) Feedback mechanism, and project completion. By statistical method on service usage data of people during the outbreak, we evaluated the results as well as discussed the models effectiveness. RESULTS: In 42 days of implementation, there were a total of 149 posts, 1660 shares in social networks with more than 4,000 interactions per week. A MHC handbook was published. Ten episodes of MHC radio and ten live TV programs were broadcast with more than 10,000 listening times. We successfully propagated 35 topics at 4 COVID-19 hospitals and 34 quarantine areas.

Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) can capture how phylogenetic relationships vary across the genome due to recombination, but reconstructing ARGs from genomic sequence data is notoriously difficult. Here we present a method for reconciling discordant phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ARGs using maximum agreement forests (MAFs). Given two discordant trees, a MAF identifies a set of topologically concordant subtrees present in both trees. We show how discordant trees can be reconciled through their MAF in a way that retains discordances strongly supported by sequence data while eliminating conflicts likely attributable to phylogenetic noise. We further show how MAFs and our reconciliation approach can be combined to select a path of local trees across the genome that maximizes the likelihood of the genomic sequence data, minimizes discordance between neighboring local trees, and identifies the recombination events necessary to explain remaining discordances to obtain a fully connected ARG. While heuristic, our ARG reconstruction approach is often as accurate as more exact methods while being much more computationally efficient. Moreover, important demographic parameters such as recombination rates can be accurately estimated from reconstructed ARGs. Finally, we apply our approach to plant infecting RNA viruses in the genus Potyvirus to demonstrate how true recombination events can be disentangled from phylogenetic noise using our ARG reconstruction methods.","output":"Espalier: Efficient tree reconciliation and ARG reconstruction using maximum agreement forests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After nearly being hunted to extinction during the fur trade of the late 20th Century, sea otter (Enhydra lutris) populations have recovered to varying degrees of their historical range. While overall population numbers and range have increased, there are regions in which expansion has occurred at a slower rate and/or animal numbers have decreased, which may be a result of chronic stress from a variety of sources. Some have employed glucocorticoid analysis in their attempts to validate these explanations. Our goal was to conduct a controlled study using sea otters managed under human care to validate the use of serum glucocorticoid analysis to monitor stress physiology in the sea otter. We used a standard ACTH challenge test to compare cortisol and corticosterone responses, thereby identifying the primary glucocorticoid in the sea otter. Fourteen sea otters of both sexes (five males, nine females), including juveniles, sub-adults and adults, participated in the study. The results of the testing supported cortisol as the primary glucocorticoid in the sea otter. Sex and age did not affect how the individual responded to the ACTH or saline injection. Interestingly, the saline injection not only confirmed the effects of the ACTH on glucocorticoid release from the adrenal glands but also provided information on how long it takes the sea otter's glucocorticoid levels to return to baseline after capture and sedation. The insight gained from this study will aid in future efforts to better understand the role of stress in free-ranging sea otter populations. Recognition of the primary glucocorticoid will facilitate evaluation of more stable biological material, such as fur or whiskers, which tend to be less affected by the diurnal cycling of glucocorticoids.","output":"Use of the ACTH challenge test to identify the predominant glucocorticoid in the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic poses substantial threats to Latinx farmworkers and other immigrants in food production and processing.

This situation has been worsened even more by the COVID-19 restrictions embraced by employers worldwide. However, a timely and sustainable intervention protocol for treating such issues has not been developed yet. Thus, the present research shows a first effective attempt based on Metacognitive therapy (MCT) to solve this issue. MCT was practiced on four individuals suffering from chronic work-related stress. Primary outcome variables were general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure. Participants were assessed at multiple baselines before the start of therapy and then attended a 3- and 6-months follow-up after treatment termination. Results showed significant improvements in general mental health, perceived stress, and blood pressure in each client. Secondary outcome variables improved toomaladaptive coping strategies, avoidance behaviors, and depression symptomscorroborating the main findings. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, results were maintained.

By applying structural decomposition analysis, we further explore the driving forces behind the slowdown in Chinas imported emissions growth, finding that it is attributable to restructuring of import patterns resulting from changes in the structures of domestic demand. These changes could have been caused by China moving along the global value chain and rebalancing its industrial linkages toward trade in carbon-efficient goods to avoid transferring emissions-intensive production to other regions, indicating a shift to less emissions-intensive trade rather than pure outsourcing.","output":"Decoupling without outsourcing?

Suffering from stressful life events may have a profound negative impact on a person's life. Nurses felt great demands on their spiritual selves even as they responded to the grave situations and caring demands needed to care for the spirits of their patients during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. However, with intentionality, suffering and stress can be ameliorated by engaging in spiritual self-care and self-renewing activities. Spirituality is recognized as an essential factor in a person's health and well-being and is integral to the process of growing through life events, such as illness, grief, and bereavement. Nurses may choose to use spiritual practices, either religious or nonreligious, to buffer the effects of stressful life events. The concept of caring for self has long being promoted, by scholars, as an essential need of nurses to care for themselves, not so they can keep on giving to others but because each nurse is worthy of being cared for by self. In the era of the pandemic in which stressful work environment, social distancing, and self-isolation make it difficult to maintain interconnectedness and build relationships, despair can occur.

Methods: Preparation of a survey, based on two validated questionnaires answered by 63 participants, to carry out an analytical, transversal and observational study. All participants were European, adult, female athletes (mean age 30.78 years, standard deviation 12.16 years). Results: UI has a high prevalence (44.4%) in female athletes (compared to 10% in non-athletes), being more frequent in those who practice long-distance running. As age and years of sport practice increase, the incidence of this pathology increases. Absorbent pads are used by more than half of women with incontinence, while the rest wet their underwear. Menopause, childbirth and surgery in the region are risk factors for UI, while the presence of urinary tract infections or candidiasis is not. The results state that urine loss does not cause anxiety or depression, but it does affect sporting life.

METHODS A randomised controlled trial was conducted at a Swedish labour ward between January 2019 and October 2020. Nulliparous women in spontaneous labour were randomised either to a birthing room designed with person-centred considerations (New room) or a Regular room. The primary outcome was a composite of four variables: vaginal non-instrumental birth; no oxytocin augmentation; postpartum blood loss < 1000 ml; and a positive childbirth experience. To detect a difference of 8% between the groups, 1274 study participants were needed, but the trial was terminated early due to consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 406 women were randomised; 204 to the New room and 202 to the Regular room.

The aim of this study was to assess the self-perceived beliefs of Montenegrin secondary school pupils regarding the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of the pupils was conducted during October and November 2020 in four randomly selected public secondary schools in Podgorica, Montenegro. All 500 pupils were asked to fill in a questionnaire that included questions on age, sex, presence of acne, perceived acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, and sources of their information about acne. RESULTS: A total of 500 pupils, 234 (46.8%) boys, and 266 (53.2%) girls, aged 14?17 years, participated in the study. Acne was self-reported in 249 (49.8%) pupils, whereas 251 (50.2%) did not report acne. Factors most often believed to aggravate acne were inadequate face washing (85.0%), hormones (84.0%), sweets (82.0%), greasy food (72.6%), makeup (71.2%), and stress (67.8%). Overall the most prevalent acne ameliorating factors were cosmetic treatment (80.4%), increased water consumption (77.6%), a diet change to a healthier food choice (77.4%), and being on school holidays (62.2%). Girls reported more frequently that genetics, stress, sweets consumption, inadequate face wash, and makeup are acne exacerbating factors, whilst cosmetic treatment, increased water consumption, smoking, and being on school holidays are acne ameliorating factors. Boys more frequently considered the benefit of losing weight. There was no statistically significant difference between pupils with and without acne in perceived factors, except for cosmetic treatment. Those with acne more frequently believed in the benefits of cosmetic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents self-perceived beliefs about factors that aggravate and ameliorate acne are myths and misconceptions without evidence-based justification.

While often attempting to employ this in corporate venturing activities, they face the challenge of simultaneously exploring new and exploiting existing business opportunities. Examining possible approaches to mastering this feat of organizational ambidexterity reveals an extensive but scattered picture. To better integrate this effort by assessing how corporate venturing is linked with organizational ambidexterity in the literature and identifying possible organizational setups, this systematic literature review builds on a sample of 172 studies. Based on different dimensions of dynamic capabilities, the analysis indicates that corporate venturing may take a solely explorative or an exploitative role, or balance both, to directly enable organizational ambidexterity, following a trade-off, respectively paradox, school of thought. As a result, this paper identifies four different setups of corporate venturing in an integrated framework, based on the ability and approach to enabling organizational ambidexterity. Here, the synthesis in the proposed framework of the studies examined allows differentiating between not directly ambidextrous separated or integrated corporate venturing and directly ambidextrous contextual or interlinked corporate venturing. As a novel contribution to the fields of strategic management, organizational change and corporate entrepreneurship, this integrated perspective suggests an often overlooked, potentially more strategic role for corporate venturing in the strategic renewal of a firms competitive advantage, thus building the basis for further empirical research on strategic corporate venturing approaches for organizational ambidexterity and their application in practice.

In this contributed paper, we show that polarization effects due to such dielectric mismatch remarkably influence the double-layer structure of a polyelectrolyte solution confined between two charged surfaces. Surprisingly, the electrostatic potential across the adsorbed polyelectrolyte double layer at the confining surface is found to decrease with increasing surface charge density, indicative of a negative differential capacitance. Furthermore, in the presence of polarization effects, the electrostatic energy stored in the double-layer structure is enhanced with an increase in the charge amplification, which is the absorption of ions on a like-charged surface. We also find that all of the important double-layer properties, such as charge amplification, energy storage, and differential capacitance, strongly depend on the polyelectrolyte backbone flexibility and the solvent quality. These interesting behaviors are attributed to the interplay between the conformational entropy of the confined polyelectrolytes, the Coulombic interaction between the charged species, and the repulsion from the surfaces with lower dielectric constant.","output":"Surface polarization effects in confined polyelectrolyte solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Firm innovation relies heavily on financing, which is why it is a hot topic in the fields of finance and innovation management.

METHODS: We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9  88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2-5) and total CT score was 6 (2-8). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p < 0.01). The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5-5) and 12 (9-14), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation.

This syndrome is classically defined with beta-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB). We present a case of BRASH syndrome in the setting of amiodarone - class III antiarrhythmic with alpha- and beta-blocking properties. Case Presentation 58-year-old obese male presents with dyspnea, and lower extremity swelling. Medical history is notable for hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization for novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) complicated by acute renal failure requiring temporary hemodialysis. Active medications include levothyroxine, amiodarone, and apixaban. Patient is afebrile, with pulse 49 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 85/54mmHg, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. On exam, respirations are non-labored, with bibasilar rales, jugular venous distention, and anasarca. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia (pulse 53bpm), with first-degree AV block and PR interval of 240ms. Basic metabolic panel: blood urea nitrogen 73 mmol/L, creatinine 2.3 mg/dL, sodium 125 mmol/L, chloride 93 mmol/L, and potassium 5.9 mEq/L. TSH is elevated (7.34 mIU/L) with normal free T4 level (1.2 ng/dL). A formal transthoracic echocardiography suggests normal systolic and diastolic function. Baseline cortisol level could not be ascertained;nevertheless, 60-minutes post-cosyntropin administration, cortisol level is 71.8 ug/dL. Repeat testing 96-hours later was not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. Discussion The diagnosis of BRASH syndrome requires bradycardia in the setting of synergistic effect of hyperkalemia and AV nodal blockade with underlying renal insufficiency, in turn exacerbating hyperkalemia. There is a paucity of literature delineating the pathophysiology of BRASH. Unlike most reported cases classically involving BB or CCB, in our patient, the AV nodal blocking medication implicated is amiodarone. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic with alpha- and beta-blocking properties which prolongs the action potential and refractory period in myocardial tissue, thereby decreasing AV conduction and sinus node function. The anti-sympathetic action, calcium, and potassium channel blockade are responsible for the negative chronotropic effects as seen in BB and CCB. There has been one reported case linking BRASH and amiodarone. However, multiple doses of diltiazem and metoprolol were also cited. Our patient received no additional AV nodal blocking agents. Conclusion Patients taking amiodarone can present in renal failure as part of BRASH syndrome. With the wide use of amiodarone, this case deserves attention from clinicians.","output":"Bradycardia, renal failure, atrioventricular nodal blockade, shock and hyperkalemia (brash) syndrome in the setting of amiodarone use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Background.

The most challenging symptoms of Covid-19 are related to respiratory distress, and most patients admitted in intensive care units cannot breathe by their own. Therefore, a crucial question is if respiratory distress can be partially explained by the CNS affection. SARS-Cov-2 is a beta-coronavirus that shares high similarities with SARS-CoV. The infection of SARS\\\\CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Those coronaviruses have been able to invade the brainstem via a synapse\\\\connected route to the medullary respiratory center, where the infected regions included the nucleus of the solitary tract and nucleus ambiguous.

METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in 18 community healthcare centers in Guangzhou, China. The responses of 600 PCPs were tagged as valid responses. Information pertaining to their background, eHealth literacy, anxiety, depression levels, social support, and individual resilience was also collected. Multilevel analysis was used to determine the association among the measures to account for the nested random effect of community health centers in different districts. RESULTS: Participants showed a moderate self-perceived level of eHealth literacy (M = 30, SD = 5.8). Participants who reported higher levels of eHealth literacy were more likely to exhibit lower levels of anxiety and depression, higher social support, and greater resilience. After adjusting for background characteristics, the results of the multilevel logistic analysis showed that eHealth literacy was significantly associated with anxiety and depression, social support, and individual resilience. Younger participants and those who were highly educated reported enhanced eHealth literacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a baseline reference for eHealth literacy among Chinese PCPs. Improving their ability to search for and use reliable web-based information was beneficial for facilitating perceived social support and raising resilience during the pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that up to 15% of COVID-19 cases warranted hospitalization between March and December 2020 due to symptom severity. With significant respiratory manifestations, there has been increased interest in the characterization of pulmonary function following recovery from COVID-19 and the potential role of inhaled medications. The following represents a single-center study investigating the pulmonary function of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at 1- and 2.5-months following discharge. Methods: Patients without prior pulmonary pathology (n= 25, mean age= 59.28 2.07 years, 52% male) hospitalized for COVID-19 (mean hospitalization= 8.32 0.93 days) underwent pulmonary function testing 1-month (27.23 2.67 days) following hospital discharge using the Platinum Elite body plethysmograph (MGC Diagnostics, Minnesota, USA). Patients were prescribed albuterol with or without an inhaled corticosteroid according to symptom severity on the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. Subsequent pulmonary testing was conducted at 2.5-months (76.45 11.68 days) postdischarge using the EasyOne Plus Spirometer (NND Medical Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). Results: At 1-month post-discharge, characterization of pulmonary function noted moderately-severe restrictive lung disease (FEV1= 64.36 2.86%, FVC= 59.36 2.71%, FEV1/FVC= 92.40 3.10%) with reduced total lung capacity (TLC= 79.68 6.84%) and preserved diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide divided by alveolar volume (DLCO/VA= 97.50 8.89%). At 2.5-months post-discharge, significant improvement of FEV1 (+13.82%, p&lt;0.001) and FVC (+13.16%, p&lt;0.001) was found, with an overall restrictive lung disease pattern of mild severity and near-normalization of FEV1 (FEV1= 78.19 2.78%, FVC= 72.52 2.46%, FEV1/FVC= 95.82 4.32%). At 2.5-months post-discharge, patients prescribed albuterol sulfate with an inhaled corticosteroid were found to have a tendency for greater improvement of pulmonary function (n= 12, FEV1= +15.73%, FVC= +12.75%, p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.01 respectively) compared to patients prescribed albuterol sulfate alone (n= 11, FEV1= +12.36%, FVC= +10.64%, p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01 respectively). However, this improvement difference did not reach significance. Conclusions: The current study aimed to characterize the pulmonary function of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 1- and 2.5-months following hospital discharge. At 1-month post-discharge, patients were found to have moderately-severe restrictive lung disease with reduced total lung capacity and preserved diffusion capacity. Significant improvement in pulmonary function was noted at 2.5-months postdischarge, with FEV1 nearing normalization.

Extensive epidemiological evidence documents maternal prenatal cigarette smoking as a major risk factor for SUID, but leaves unclear whether quitting reduces risk. This Commentary draws attention to a report by Anderson et al. (Pediatrics. 2019, 143[4]) that represents a breakthrough on this question and uses their data on SUID risk reduction to delineate potential economic benefits. Using a five-year (2007-11) U.S. CDC Birth Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death dataset, Anderson et al. demonstrated that compared to those who continued smoking, women who quit or reduced smoking by third trimester decreased the adjusted odds of SUID risk by 23% (95% CI, 13%-33%) and 12% (95% CI, 2%-21%), respectively. We applied these reductions to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' recommended value of a statistical life in 2020 ($10.1 million). Compared to continued smoking during pregnancy, the economic benefits per woman of quitting or reducing smoking are $4700 (95% CI $2700-$6800) and $2500 (95% CI, $400-$4300), respectively. While the U.S. obtained aggregate annual economic benefits of $0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.82) billion from pregnant women who quit or reduced smoking, it missed an additional $1.16 (95%CI 0.71-1.60) billion from the women who continued smoking. Delineating the health and economic impacts of decreasing smoking during pregnancy using large epidemiological studies like Anderson et al. is critically important for conducting meaningful economic analyses of the benefits-costs of developing more effective interventions for decreasing smoking during pregnancy.","output":"Decreasing smoking during pregnancy: Potential economic benefit of reducing sudden unexpected infant death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented economic support measures from governments across Europe With this, the crisis has provided an occasion for a significant demonstration of the ability of states to implement policies and deliver services This could create expectations among electorates of permanent changes to the macroeconomic regime, towards one characterised by a more protective state and a rebalancing between the state and the market Significant political barriers to such a shift remain The article argues that, in contrast to the aftermath of the two previous economic crises in Europe, many new ideas are floating around and support for a more protective state is emerging across the political spectrum The current crisis might thus represent a turning point","output":"A new political economy for Europe post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) made it necessary to evaluate in more detail the processes of neuroinflammation as an integral component of the pathogenesis of viral infection.

The workflow consists of a set of Python codes of which the execution is managed within Nextflow to annotate coding variants based on 37 criteria. SWAAT also includes an auxiliary workflow allowing a versatile use for genes other than ADME members. Our tool also includes a machine learning random forest binary classifier that showed an accuracy of 73%. Moreover, SWAAT outperformed six commonly used sequence-based variant prediction tools (PROVEAN, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD, MetaSVM, and FATHMM) in terms of sensitivity and has comparable specificity.

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients, the effects of pregnancy on the course of COVID-19 disease, and the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes. DISCUSSION: The physiological and mechanical changes associated with pregnancy increase maternal susceptibility to infections and complicate intubation and mechanical ventilation. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant patients are cough and fever, although many infected individuals are asymptomatic. The majority of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 disease have a mild course of illness and will recover without needing to deliver, but the risks of critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation are increased compared to the general population. Risk factors for death and severe disease include obesity, diabetes, and maternal age > 40 years. Women in their third trimester have the highest risk for critical illness, intensive care unit admission, and need for mechanical ventilation. Adverse fetal outcomes of maternal COVID-19 infection include increased risk of miscarriage, prematurity, and fetal growth restriction. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible but has not been conclusively proven. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a potentially deadly infection, but data are limited concerning the pregnant population. Pregnant patients appear to present similarly to the general population, with fever and cough being the most reported symptoms in studies.

The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The \\"Opacification in the olfactory cleft\\" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis.

METHODS: From Jan 16 to Dec 31, 2019, IPC professionals were invited through email and campaigns to complete the online Hand Hygiene Self-Assessment Framework (HHSAF). A geospatial clustering algorithm selected unique health-care facilities responses and post-stratification weighting was applied to improve representativeness. Weighted median HHSAF scores and IQR were reported. Drivers of the HHSAF score were determined through a generalised estimation equation. FINDINGS: 3206 unique responses from 90 countries (46% WHO Member States) were included. The HHSAF score indicated an intermediate hand hygiene implementation level (350 points, IQR 248-430), which was positively associated with country income level and health-care facility funding structure. System Change had the highest score (85 points, IQR 55-100), whereby alcohol-based hand rub at the point of care has become standard practice in many health-care facilities, especially in high-income countries. Institutional Safety Climate had the lowest score (55 points, IQR 35-75). From 2015 to 2019, the median HHSAF score in health-care facilities participating in both HHSAF surveys (n=190) stagnated. INTERPRETATION: Most health-care facilities had an intermediate level of hand hygiene implementation or higher, for which health-care facility funding and country income level were important drivers.

METHODS This prospective cohort study evaluated young (18-35 years old) athletes referred for cardiopulmonary symptoms that were present>28 days from COVID-19 diagnosis. CPET findings in post-COVID athletes were compared with a matched reference group of healthy athletes without COVID-19. Post-COVID athletes underwent repeat CPET between 3 and 6 months after initial evaluation. RESULTS Twenty-one consecutive post-COVID athletes with cardiopulmonary symptoms (21.93.9 years old, 43% female) were evaluated 3.02.1 months after diagnosis.

The most common concerns reported included fear of infection at the workplace (81%), stigma from colleagues (79%), lack of workplace support (63%), and inadequate availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) (56%). In multivariable analysis, moderate (adjusted prevalence ratio, [aPR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2C4.0) and high (aPR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.0C7.0) risk perception towards COVID-19 (compared with low-risk perception) were associated with psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-four percent of HCWs surveyed in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients during the early COVID-19 epidemic in Uganda reported psychological distress related to fear of infection, stigma, and inadequate PPE. Higher perceived personal risk towards COVID-19 was associated with increased psychological distress. To optimize patient care during the pandemic and future outbreaks, workplace management may consider identifying and addressing HCW concerns, ensuring sufficient PPE and training, and reducing infection-associated stigma.","output":"Risk perception and psychological state of healthcare workers in referral hospitals during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"US-based Dana Inc, which develops engineered driveline, sealing and thermal-management technologies, has been named a 2019 Supplier of the Year' by General Motors Co (GM)","output":"Dana recognised by GM as a Supplier of the Year winner"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] This Perspective focuses on thiol-mediated uptake, that is, the entry of substrates into cells enabled by oligochalcogenides or mimics, often disulfides, and inhibited by thiol-reactive agents.

Usage in large caliber cerebral vessels has therefore been limited as few implants with diameters > 5 mm exist. We present our initial experience in treating cerebral aneurysms using the 5.5 mm and 6 mm diameter implants of the Derivo embolization device (DED). METHODS Our prospectively maintained institutional database was reviewed to identify patients in whom a > 5 mm DED was implanted between November 2016 and February 2021. The primary efficacy outcome was complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion at 6 months (O'Kelly-Marotta, OKM, C-D, adapted for magnetic resonance angiography). Safety outcomes included 30-day major morbidity defined as modified Rankin Score (mRS) 3-5, mortality, serious adverse events and procedural complications. RESULTS A total of 21 large diameter DEDs were deployed in 18 patients (age 59.5  14.1 years), harboring 19 unruptured aneurysms. Of the aneurysms 14 (73.7%) were saccular in morphology (sac diameter 10.9  5.5 mm, neck diameter 6.8  3.1 mm), 3 (15.8%) aneurysms were dissecting, 1 (5.3%) iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm and 1 (5.3%) fusiform. Aneurysm locations were: ICA (internal carotid artery) (n = 17); (7 cavernous, 4 paraophthalmic, 2 paraclinoid, 1 petrous, 2 communicating, 1 cervical); vertebrobasilar (n = 2). Adjunct stenting to optimize proximal wall apposition was undertaken in 5 (27.8%) patients. At 6 months 75% of patients followed-up met the primary efficacy endpoint (OKM C-D). There were no serious adverse events, 30-day major morbidity (mRS 3-5) or mortality. CONCLUSION Implantation of large diameter (5.5 mm and 6 mm) DEDs into capacious cerebral vessels to treat a range of complex aneurysms is safe and technically feasible but may require adjunct stenting to optimize proximal wall apposition. Short-term efficacy of this device subset is comparable to previous DED and other flow diverter studies. Long-term follow-up and comparative studies are required for further assessment.","output":"Implantation of Large Diameter (5.5-6 mm) Derivo Embolization Devices for the Treatment of Cerebral Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsCOVID-19 is an on-going pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including mania. We present a case of a middle aged man presenting with acute mania with psychotic symptoms 20 days post COVID infection in the absence of prior psychiatric illness. This report highlights the need for rigorous neuropsychiatric assessment in patient with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.MethodA 52-year-old man of West African origin with past history of hypertension and no previous history of mental health illness presented with acute manic symptoms on background of two weeks of high fever, diarrhoea, mild headache, dry cough and anosmia. He was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID PCR test. He was under self-isolation along with his family members who exhibited mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, none of them required hospital admission. He was initially fearful to seek medical attention but was brought in by family after exhibiting behaviour changes, obsession with toilet cleaning, reckless spending and getting aggressive approximately two weeks after the onset of acute upper respiratory symptoms. He presented elated in mood with pressure of speech and grandiose ideas. Investigations like neuroimaging and bloods were unremarkable. Initial psychiatric assessment found symptoms consistent with acute mania and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. During admission, he was sexually disinhibited and agitated on the ward requiring IM antipsychotics. He was treated with high dose of Olanzapine and Sodium valproate and his symptoms subsided within two weeks.ResultThis case emphasises the manifestation of neuropsychiatric illness post COVID-19 without a background of psychiatric illness, hypoxemia and cerebral infarction.Based on the CORONERVE Programme and latest retrospective Lancet cohort studies, the period between 14 and 90 days after diagnosis, 5.8% COVID-19 survivors had their first recorded diagnosis of psychiatric illness.It is also important to consider other organic disease given the simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19. Although it is not yet possible to confirm here due to the lack of a validated CSF-PCR assay, previous reports have implicated SARS-CoV-2 in the development of viral encephalitis, and this remains an important differential.ConclusionClinicians should be alert to the possibility of patients with COVID-19 developing neuropsychiatric complications post SARS-CoV-2 infection, mandating the need for vigilant initial neuropsychiatric assessment and possibly follow-up care in 3 months.","output":"Acute mania with psychotic symptom in post COVID-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic devastated substantial portions of the tourism industry; the cruise industry particularly suffered from negative publicity as the virus spread rapidly on cruise ships.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective audit of all stroke and TIA presentations in 2020 and compared these with data from 2019. We collected information about stroke subtype, severity, time from stroke/TIA onset to presentation and acute reperfusion therapies. ResultsBetween January-February and April-March 2020, there was a 15% drop in acute stroke presentations (128 vs. 109). In the same period \\"stroke mimic\\" presentations dropped by 22%. The proportion of patients attending the emergency department within 4.5hrs was only 36% compared with 48% over the similar period in 2019. ConclusionsAlthough the raw numbers of ischemic stroke presentations remained stable during NSW Covid lockdown, the proportion of patients presenting within time window for acute reperfusion therapies fell. The number of TIAs similarly fell suggesting COVID-19 discouraged patients from presenting to hospital which placed them at higher risk of disabling stroke.

Peptides represent a simple, safe and adaptable basis for vaccine development; however, the potency of peptide vaccines is insufficient in most cases for significant therapeutic efficacy. Several methods, such as Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System and ISCOMATRIX, have been developed to enhance the potency of peptide vaccines. One way of increasing the loading of MHC class II peptides occurs through the use of Ii-Key technology. Ii-Key (LRMK), a portion of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii), facilitates the direct loading of epitopes to the MHC class II molecule groove. Linking the Ii-Key moiety via a simple polymethylene bridge to an MHC class II epitope, to generate an Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrid, greatly enhances the vaccine potency of the tethered epitope. The combination of such Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrids with MHC class I epitope-containing peptides might generate a potent peptide vaccine for malignancies and infectious diseases.

SP-D exerts antimicrobial effects and dampens inflammation through direct microbial interactions and modulation of host cell responses via a series of cellular receptors. However, low protein concentrations, genetic variation, biochemical modification, and proteolytic breakdown can induce decomposition of multimeric SP-D into low-molecular weight forms, which may induce pro-inflammatory SP-D signaling. Multimeric SP-D can decompose into trimeric SP-D, and this process, and total SP-D levels, are partly determined by variation within the SP-D gene, SFTPD. SP-D has been implicated in the development of respiratory diseases including respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, allergic asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disease-induced breakdown or modifications of SP-D facilitate its systemic leakage from the lung, and circulatory SP-D is a promising biomarker for lung injury. Moreover, studies in preclinical animal models have demonstrated that local pulmonary treatment with recombinant SP-D is beneficial in these diseases. In recent years, SP-D has been shown to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in various non-pulmonary organs and to have effects on lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory effects in vessel walls, which enhance the risk of atherosclerosis. A common SFTPD polymorphism is associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes, and SP-D has been associated with metabolic disorders because of its effects in the endothelium and adipocytes and its obesity-dampening properties. This review summarizes and discusses the reported genetic associations of SP-D with disease and the clinical utility of circulating SP-D for respiratory disease prognosis. Moreover, basic research on the mechanistic links between SP-D and respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases is summarized.

We study three modern VCAs: Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Answers to these questions differ substantially depending on VCA. First, the average utilization on an unconstrained link varies between 0.8 Mbps and 1.9 Mbps. Given temporary reduction of capacity, some VCAs can take as long as 50 seconds to recover to steady state. Differences in proprietary congestion control algorithms also result in unfair bandwidth allocations: in constrained bandwidth settings, one Zoom video conference can consume more than 75% of the available bandwidth when competing with another VCA (e.g., Meet, Teams). For some VCAs, client utilization can decrease as the number of participants increases, due to the reduced video resolution of each participant's video stream given a larger number of participants.

Filters are installed in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of sampling used ventilation filters to assess the types and concentrations of virus aerosols present in buildings. METHODS: The HVAC filters from 2 large public buildings in Minneapolis and Seattle were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses and viruses with bioterrorism potential. Four air-handling units were selected from each building, and a total of 64 prefilters and final filters were tested for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza 1-3, adeno, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Representative pieces of each filter were cut and eluted with a buffer solution. RESULTS: Attempts were made to detect viruses by inoculation of these eluates in cell cultures (Vero, MDCK, and RK-13) and specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. Two passages of eluates in cell cultures or these eggs did not reveal the presence of any live virus. The eluates were also examined by polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA, respectively. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that existing building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. As integrated long-term bioaerosol sampling devices, they may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can inform the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses and possible deterrents against the spread of bioterrorism agents.","output":"Detection of viruses in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the start of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many modeling efforts to assess several issues of importance to public health.

METHODS: Sixty samples of caries-infected teeth were divided into five groups: (1) control (SDF alone), (2) SDF plus immediate composite restoration, (3) SDF plus immediate GIC restoration, (4) SDF plus delayed composite restoration, and (5) SDF plus delayed GIC restoration. The delay between SDF and restoration for groups 4 and 5 was two weeks. Tooth color was measured at three sites for each sample at baseline before SDF application and at multiple times. RESULTS: When comparing the change between baseline color to the color at the last time measurement in all groups, we found that Group 4 (17.4  4.3) and Group 5 (14.4  5.3) changed the least compared to baseline and were not statistically significantly different from each other. CONCLUSION: Under laboratory conditions, delaying application of restoration for two weeks after SDF to samples of caries-infected teeth significantly reduced discoloration, with neither composite nor GIC being superior. If these findings are confirmed in a clinical setting, delaying restoration by two weeks could provide an inexpensive oral health strategy to reduce the negative aesthetic impact associated with SDF.","output":"Silver diamine fluoride with delayed restoration reduces tooth discoloration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous barrier devices have recently been developed and rapidly deployed worldwide in an effort to protect health care workers (HCWs) from exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during high-risk procedures. However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine, and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data were captured by high-speed flash photography, and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed toward the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled toward the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the HCW located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough, and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution, and further validation studies are necessary.","output":"Barrier Devices, Intubation, and Aerosol Mitigation Strategies: Personal Protective Equipment in the Time of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are theoretical concerns that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) could increase the risk of severe Covid-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine if ACEIs and ARBs are associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization overall, or hospitalization involving intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. DESIGN: Observational case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries aged  66 years with hypertension, treated with ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), or thiazide diuretics. MAIN MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes of Covid-19 hospitalization, or hospitalization involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: A total of 35,300 cases of hospitalized Covid-19 were matched to 228,228 controls on calendar date and neighborhood of residence. The median age of cases was 79 years, 57.4% were female, and the median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (interquartile range 5C12). ACEIs and ARBs were associated with a slight reduction in Covid-19 hospitalization risk compared with treatment with other first-line antihypertensives (OR for ACEIs 0.95, 95% CI 0.92C0.98; OR for ARBs 0.94, 95% CI 0.90C0.97). Similar results were obtained for hospitalizations involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. There were no meaningful differences in risk for ACEIs compared with ARBs. In an analysis restricted to monotherapy with a first-line agent, CCBs were associated with a small increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization compared with ACEIs (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04C1.14), ARBs (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05C1.15), or thiazide diuretics (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03C1.19). CONCLUSIONS: ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization or with hospitalization involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. The finding of a small increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization with CCBs was unexpected and could be due to residual confounding.

Seven healthy males performed a 2-min maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the elbow flexors or knee extensors on four separate days. Electromyographic responses were elicited by nerve stimulation (maximal M-wave) in all sessions and by transcranial magnetic stimulation (motor-evoked potential; silent period) and spinal tract stimulation (cervicomedullary or thoracic motor-evoked potentials; silent period) in one session each per limb. During sustained maximal voluntary contractions, motor-evoked potential area normalised to M-waves increased from baseline in biceps brachii (155  55%) and rectus femoris (151  44%) (both p  0.045). At the end of maximal voluntary contractions, spinal tract motor-evoked potential area normalised to M-waves was smaller than baseline in biceps brachii (74  23%; p = 0.012) but not rectus femoris (108  40%; p = 0.999). The ratio of motor-evoked potential to spinal tract-evoked potential areas increased dramatically from 90 to 115 s in biceps brachii (p = 0.001) but not in rectus femoris (p = 0.999). Silent period durations increased similarly in both muscles (p  0.008) after transcranial and spinal stimulation. Sustained maximal contractions elicit different neurophysiological adjustments in upper- and lower-limb muscles. Specifically, motoneuronal excitability was reduced in biceps brachii, but not in rectus femoris, and this reduction required greater compensatory adjustments from the motor cortex. Therefore, changes in cortical and spinal excitability during sustained maximal exercise are likely specific to the muscle performing the task.","output":"Sustained Maximal Voluntary Contractions Elicit Different Neurophysiological Responses in Upper- and Lower-Limb Muscles in Men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing society to re-evaluate how it educates learners of all levels, from medical students to faculty.

However, little is known regarding the variations in the mental health issues experienced by college students during the peak versus reopening stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: To assess these issues, an online longitudinal survey was conducted via a WeChat applet. Undergraduates (n = 300) were recruited from 26 universities throughout Jinan in February 2020 (T1 ? the epidemic peak stage) and in January 2021 (T2 ? the society reopening stage). Their mental status was determined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item, and the Insomnia Severity Index. RESULTS: Of the original 300 college students recruited for this survey, 294 responses at T1 and 285 at T2 were analyzed. Compared with responses obtained at T1, college students at T2 showed a greater prevalence of depression (65.3 vs. 51.0%; p = 0.001) and anxiety (47.7 vs. 38.1%, p = 0.019), and experienced more severe depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001). Both males (p = 0.03) and females (p < 0.01) showed higher levels of depression at T2 versus T1, while no differences were obtained with regard to anxiety and insomnia. At T1, Grade 4 students showed greater levels of depression (p = 0.005) and anxiety (p = 0.008) than that of Grade 1 students. While at T2, only greater levels of depression (p = 0.004) were present when compared with that of Grade 1 students. Additionally, Grade 4 college students demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression at T2 versus T1 (p = 0.03), but no statistically differences were present for anxiety and insomnia. No statistically significant differences were obtained among the 4 grades of college students for insomnia at either the T1 or T2. CONCLUSION: With progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, college students showed increasing levels of depression and anxiety, with Grade 4 college students being most seriously affected.

Since we could not find a consolidated source of information on African competitions, we include many details and links, hoping that this paper will serve as a valuable starting point for future investigators. Next, we present some survey findings on the attitudes towards and experiences of mathematical competitions, both from the perspective of teachers in secondary schools as well as from secondary school students, and whether these experiences have served to improve or degrade their perceptions of mathematics in general. Among other results, we find that teachers view their students participation in mathematics competitions as being important, with the biggest barrier to participation being that there are not enough competitions at appropriate levels available, and that students enjoy mathematics competitions and are more likely to pursue a STEM career because of them. Finally, we present some suggestions on how this research may be taken further, and on how the state of mathematical competition culture in Africa may be improved.","output":"Mathematical competitions in Africa: their prevalence and relevance to students and teachers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually a symptom of another medical condition. People with poor overall health are more likely to develop severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may have unwanted symptoms such as ED. COVID-19-related stress, anxiety, and depression can also impact sexual health and possibly lead to ED. There are various treatment options for patients with ED. However, real-world evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment and comorbidities of patients with ED is limited. Objectives To estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment and comorbidities of patients with ED in the United States. Methods This retrospective real-world data (RWD) analysis used the IQVIA PharMetrics? Plus claims database, which is a patient-Centric, closed claims database of fully adjudicated pharmacy, hospital and medical claims anonymized at the patient level, that captures the complete patient journey for all services billed to and covered by the patient's health plan. We compared the ED treatment and comorbidities in adult males aged 18+ years with ED in the same 3-month periods before (01March - 31May, 2019) and during (01March C 31May, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. ED treatment included any ED-related claims, prescriptions of any and individual phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) medications (avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil). Results See the table below for number of patients having ED-related claims, having any and individual PDE5i prescriptions, number of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, and percentage of patients with each of the top 10 comorbidities, in the 3-month periods before and during COVID-19. Conclusions RWD showed that ED-related claims significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the pandemic's impact on ED patients health. However, the use of PDE5i medications remained stable during the pandemic. Key comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms, testicular hypofunction, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate, during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic period, highlighted the impact of the pandemic on ED patients health and need for managing their other comorbid chronic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion of alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs admitted into the SUS and associated factors. METHODS: This is a sectional study developed with alumni from Primary Health Care Multiprofessional Residency Programs from all over Brazil, encompassing the period from 2015 to 2019. Participants answered an online questionnaire with general personal information, admission into stricto sensu graduate school, the labor market and, specifically, the SUS. We applied Pearson's chi-square test for bivariate analyses and Poisson's regression for multiple analysis. RESULTS: A total of 365 alumni from Programs from all Brazilian regions participated in the study. Of those, 80.2% reported entry into the labor market and 47.9% reported being employed in the SUS. Admission into the SUS has been associated with the professions that make up the Reference Team for Primary Health Care (PHC) (PR = 1.87;95% CI 1.54C2.28) and non-admission into stricto sensu graduate programs (PR = 0.77;95% CI 0.61C0.97). Regarding admission characteristics, the PHC scenario (47.4%) and work focused on health care (84.9%) were prevalent. Almost 40% of alumni who entered the SUS are working with unstable contracts. Besides, being a residency alumnus is often undervalued in recruitment (56.9%). Among those admitted into the SUS, 8.7% reported being selected to work in the Covid-19 pandemic effort.

In addition, their ability to offer rapid onset of action with reduced first-pass metabolism make them suitable for use in palliative and end-of-life care to provide fast relief of symptoms. This is particularly important in COVID-19, as patients can deteriorate rapidly. Despite the advantages, these routes of administration face challenges including a relatively small surface area for effective drug absorption, small volume of fluid for drug dissolution and the presence of a mucus barrier, thereby limiting the number of drugs that are suitable to be delivered through the transmucosal route.

Because immune responses often play a role, antivirals may not ensure a successful outcome. To identify pathogenic mechanisms and potential adjunctive therapeutic options, we compared the extent to which avian influenza A/H5N1 virus and seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus impair alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability in an in vitro model of acute lung injury, defined the role of virus-induced soluble mediators in these injury effects, and demonstrated that the effects are prevented or reduced by bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. We verified the in vivo relevance of these findings in mice experimentally infected with influenza A/H5N1. We found that, in vitro, the alveolar epithelium's protein permeability and fluid clearance were dysregulated by soluble immune mediators released upon infection with avian (A/Hong Kong/483/97, H5N1) but not seasonal (A/Hong Kong/54/98, H1N1) influenza virus. The reduced alveolar fluid transport associated with down-regulation of sodium and chloride transporters was prevented or reduced by coculture with mesenchymal stromal cells. In vivo, treatment of aged H5N1-infected mice with mesenchymal stromal cells increased their likelihood of survival. We conclude that mesenchymal stromal cells significantly reduce the impairment of alveolar fluid clearance induced by A/H5N1 infection in vitro and prevent or reduce A/H5N1-associated acute lung injury in vivo.

In portions of the world, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing remains slow and in limited supply, and computed tomography is expensive, inefficient, and involves exposure to ionizing radiation. Multiple studies evaluating the efficiency of lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) have been published recently, but include relatively small cohorts and often focus on characteristics associated with severe illness rather than screening efficacy. This study utilizes a retrospective cohort to evaluate the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, predictive values) of lung POCUS in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, and to determine lung score cutoffs that maximize performance for use as a screening tool. RESULTS: Lung POCUS examinations had sensitivity 86%, specificity 71.6%, NPV 81.7%, and PPV 77.7%. The Lung Ultrasound Score had an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78, 0.90). When including only complete examinations visualizing 12 lung fields, lung POCUS had sensitivity 90.9% and specificity 75.6%, with NPV 87.2% and PPV 82.0% and an area under the curve of 0.89 (95% CI 0.83, 0.96). Lung POCUS was less accurate in patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, severe emphysema, and heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: When applied in the appropriate patient population, lung POCUS is an inexpensive and reliable tool for rapid screening and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients with influenza-like illness. Adoption of lung POCUS screening for SARS-CoV-2 may identify patients who do not require additional testing and reduce the need for RT-PCR testing in resource-limited environments and during surge periods.

There is an increasing need to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care, in order to manage their limited resources. This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed in Bogot, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use an SEIR model that includes three different categories of infection: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December.

High rate of infection due to the lethal virus has caused major sufferings and premature deaths to many budding possibilities. Nevertheless, quick identification of the disease can lead to faster recovery with medical help. Unfortunately, the ratio of COVID infection to methods of early medical identification of disease is quite feeble. This has motivated researchers in designing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can identify the disease from easily available chest X-Ray images of patients. However, the success rate of identification of COVID cases is not satisfactory since the proposed systems are emphasizing on identifying pneumonia rather than separating the cause of it as COVID or non COVID. In this paper, the authors have investigated the cause of such misclassification and have identified feature generalization as one of the reasons. A feature fusion based approach is proposed by the authors to encourage generalization of input features to CAD for better identification of COVID 19. The reason for proposing the fusion based feature formation is encompassing diverse X-Ray image information by extracting descriptors with assorted techniques and uniting them with fusion. The classification results with fusion based approach have reported substantial improvements compared to individual techniques.

In this study, comparative phylogenetic analyses conducted on replicase- (ORF1b) and glycoprotein- (ORF3) gene amplicons identified 10 putative natural recombinants amongst 28 viruses representing all six genotypes from across the Indo-Pacific region. The  4.6 kb genomic region spanning the two amplicons was sequenced for three putative recombinant viruses from Vietnam (genotype 3/5), the Philippines (genotype 5/2) and Indonesia (genotype 3/2). SimPlot analysis using these and representative parental virus sequences confirmed that each was a recombinant genotype and identified a recombination hotspot in a region just upstream of the ORF1b C-terminus. Maximum-likelihood breakpoint analysis predicted identical crossover positions in the Vietnamese and Indonesian recombinants, and a crossover position 12 nt upstream in the Philippine recombinant. Homologous genetic recombination in the same genome region was also demonstrated in recombinants generated experimentally in shrimp co-infected with YHV and GAV. The high frequency with which natural recombinants were identified indicates that genetic exchange amongst genotypes is occurring commonly in Asia and playing a significant role in expanding the genetic diversity in the yellow head complex.

Scientific evidence supports that cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing severe complications. COVID-19 patients can be asymptomatic during part or all of their disease course, therefore it is a compelling need to develop universal pre-interventional COVID-19 screening guidelines. The aim of this study is to is review COVID-19 positive rate among asymptomatic cancer patients since the implementation of universal policy at our institution, and assess the impact of diagnosing COVID-19 on delay of oncologic interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study population comprised of all cancer patients planned for high risk interventions between April 1, 2020 - May 14, 2020 at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi [CCAD] after implementing universal COVID-19 screening policy. DISCUSSION Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among cancer patients could result in poor outcomes. Universal screening for high-risk populations may facilitate earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and implementation of control strategies. Our review demonstrated that [7.5%] of asymptomatic cancer patients tested positive for COVID-19 after implementation of universal prospective screening policy. The overall evidence supporting universal COVID-19 screening of cancer patients is limited, yet as tests become more widely available, it may be reasonable to screen all cancer patients for COVID-19 before anticancer therapies. While such policy may delay and affect the timing of anticancer therapy as shown in this report, it should improve the safety of care for oncology patients and help protect healthcare workers.

Aim: In light of the dynamic developments and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the care of people in need of long-term care the following questions arise: How do leaders of care facilities perceive the challenges, how burdened are they and how do they cope with these? METHODS Leaders from outpatient and inpatient nursing and hospice care facilities were contacted by e-mail to participate in an online survey. Closed questions were analysed descriptively, open information was analysed by content analysis. RESULTS From of 4,333 nursing facilities contacted, usable information was available from 525 persons. The greatest pandemic-related, interdependent challenges include concern about infections of patients and employees, procurement of protective equipment, compliance with hygiene regulations, inconsistency and lack of transparency of information and guidelines that are important for work, and loss of income and lead to a cascade of burdens. Around 40 % of respondents are uncertain whether they can cope with these. According to the respondents, the well-being and presenteeism of the leaders surveyed has deteriorated in the course of the pandemic outbreak and they appeared to be more often ill at work. Financial and structural measures, the strengthening of social cohesion and explanation were mentioned as coping strategies.

DESIGN : Evidence-based algorithms were developed from published research as well as \\"needs and values\\" assessments. Research evidence was obtained from 97 studies reporting the protectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis, seasonal vaccination, and mask use. Needs and values assessments were undertaken by international experts in pandemic infection control and local healthcare workers. Opportunity and resources costs were not determined. SETTING The Australian government commissioned the development of an evidence-based algorithm for inclusion in the 2008 revision of the Australian Health and Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza. PARTICIPANTS Two international infection control teams responsible for healthcare worker safety during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak reviewed the evidence-based algorithms. The algorithms were then reviewed for needs and values by eight local clinicians who were considered key frontline clinicians during the contain and sustain phases. The international teams reviewed for practicability of implementation, whereas local clinicians reviewed for clinician compliance. RESULTS Despite strong evidence for vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis providing significant protection, clinicians believed they required the additional combinations of both masks and face shields. Despite the equivocal evidence for the efficacy of surgical and N95 masks and the provision of algorithms appropriate for the level of risk according to clinical care during a pandemic, clinicians still demanded N95 masks plus face shields in combination with prophylaxis and novel vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Conventional evidence-based principles could not be applied to formulate recommendations due to the lack of pandemic-specific efficacy data of protection tools and the inherent unpredictability of pandemics.

Data were collected via an online survey conducted among university students across Poland. The survey addressed recent lifestyle changes that were a result of the pandemic as well as psychological distress, symptoms of insomnia and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. The results indicate that protective factors include maintaining a daily routine, staying physically active, following a usual eating pattern and taking care of sleep hygiene. Changes in behavior contributing to poorer mental health included giving up a daily routine, neglecting meals, tidiness, hygiene as well as social relationships, changes in food intake, sleeping schedule, a decrease in physical activity and the onset of sexual dysfunctions. A history of psychiatric treatment and an increase in self-harm as well as an increase in alcohol and tobacco consumption were also found to be associated with psychological distress. Experienced lifestyle and behavioral changes and their impact on mental health were apparent throughout the obtained data, highlighting the need for psychological support in the studied population.

However, there is a lack of empirical data on the reverse causality between the two variables and on the correlation between the symptom severity of insomnia and PLEs. This study aimed to explore the bidirectional associations between insomnia and PLEs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 938 students aged 14C25 years completed both waves of the survey before and during the pandemic (the first wave: October 2019 to November 2019; the second wave: April 2020 to May 2020). PLEs were assessed using the 15-item positive subscale of the community assessment of psychic experiences (CAPE-P15), and insomnia was assessed using three questions on difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening. RESULTS: Students with baseline insomnia were more likely to exhibit new-onset PLEs during the pandemic (OR: 5.13, 95% CI: 2.54C10.38), while no significant predictive effect of insomnia was found for the persistence and severity of PLEs. Meanwhile, baseline PLEs not only predicted the presence of insomnia during the pandemic (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.25C3.65) but also correlated with its severity (B: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.47C1.31). CONCLUSION: The study provides the first piece of evidence for the bidirectional association between insomnia and PLEs in the general population. However, although insomnia has an important predictive role in the occurrence of PLEs, it does not predict the persistence and development of PLEs, suggesting that there is a more complex mechanism underlying the process.","output":"The Bidirectional Associations Between Insomnia and Psychotic-Like Experiences Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has seriously affected our society.

In this study we analyzed the complete genome sequences of 122 SFTSV strains to determine the phylogeny, evolution and reassortment of the virus. We revealed that the evolutionary rate of three genome segments were different, with highest in the S segment and lowest in the L segment. The SFTSV strains were phylogenetically classified into 5 lineages (A, B, C, D and E) with each genome segment. SFTSV strains from China were classified in all 5 lineages, strains from South Korea were classified into 3 lineages (A, D, and E), and all strains from Japan were classified in only linage E. Using the average evolutionary rate of the three genome segments, we found that the extant SFTSV originated 20C87 years ago in the Dabie Mountain area in central China. The viruses were then transmitted to other areas of China, Japan and South Korea. We also found that six SFTSV strains were reassortants. Selection pressure analysis suggested that SFTSV was under purifying selection according to the four genes (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, non-structural protein), and two sites (37, 1033) of glycoproteins were identified as being under strong positive selection.

Right now, one of the main questions about COVID-19 is whether the second wave is less severe and deadly than the first wave. In order to answer this challenging question, we decided to evaluate the chest X-ray (CXR) severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the mechanical ventilation (MV) use, the patient outcome, and certain clinical/laboratory data during the second wave and compare them with those of the first wave. METHODS During the two COVID-19 waves two independent groups of hospitalised patients were selected. The first group consisted of the first 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the first wave. The second group consisted of another 100 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital during the second wave. We enlisted only Caucasian male patients over the age of fifty for whom the final outcome was available. For each patient, the CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the MV use, the patient outcome, comorbidities, corticosteroid use, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were considered. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to compare the data obtained from the two waves. RESULTS The CXR severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, the in-hospital mortality, and CRP levels were significantly higher in the first wave than in the second wave (p  .041). Although not statistically significant, the frequency of MV use was higher in the first wave.

The review identified several problems that can contribute to incentive misalignment by compromising the triple aims (cost, quality, and access) in this epidemic. Some of these issues include the inefficacy of conventional payment mechanisms in providing incentives for providers, practice guidelines in pain management that are not easily implementable across different medical specialties, barriers in adopting multi-modal pain management strategies, low capacity of providers/treatments to address opioid/substance use disorders, the complexity of addressing the co-occurrence of chronic pain and opioid use disorders, and patients non-adherence to opioid substitution treatments.

In British Columbia (BC), Canada second doses were deferred up to 16 weeks and ChAdOx1 was only initially recommended for adults 55 years of age and older. We compared single-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the spring 2021 wave in BC when Alpha and Gamma variants of concern (VOC) predominated. Methods: VE was estimated against infection and hospitalization by test-negative design: cases were RT-PCR test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were test-negative. Adults 50-69 years old with specimen collection between April 4 and May 22 (weeks 14-20) were included. Variant-specific VE was estimated between weeks 17-20 when genetic characterization of all case viruses was performed, primarily through whole genome sequencing. Results: VE analyses included 7,116 (10%) cases and 60,958 controls. Three-quarters of vaccinated participants received mRNA vaccine (60% BNT162b2, 15% mRNA-1273) and 25% received ChAdOx1. Half of genetically characterized viruses were Alpha, with 38% Gamma, 4% Delta and 8% non-VOCs. Single-dose VE against any infection was 75% (95%CI: 72-78) for BNT162b2, 82% (95%CI: 76-87) for mRNA-1273 and 61% (95%CI: 54-66) for ChAdOx1. VE against hospitalization was 83% (95%CI: 76-89), 85% (95%CI: 63-94) and 96% (95%CI: 86-99), respectively. VE against Alpha vs. Gamma infections did not differ among mRNA (78%;95%CI: 73-82 and 80%;95%CI: 74-85) or ChAdOx1 (66%;95%CI: 57-74 and 60%;95%CI: 48-69) recipients. Conclusions: A single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by at least 75%, including infections due to early VOC. Although effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 was lower at 60% against infection, just one dose of any vaccine reduced the hospitalization risk by more than 80%. In the context of constrained vaccine supplies, these findings have implications for global vaccine deployment to reduce the overall burden of infections and hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Comparative single-dose mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, including early variants of concern: a test-negative design, British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019 the novel Corona virus which is called COVID 19 was originated in China and now it has spread all over the world.

Radiofrequency was applied to the livers using four protocols: (1) Group A-1, monopolar mode using a clustered electrode (n=11); (2) Group A-2, monopolar mode using an Octopus electrode (n=11); (3) Group B-1, consecutive monopolar mode using three, clustered electrodes (n=8); and (4) Group B-2, switching monopolar mode using two Octopus electrodes (n=9). The energy efficiency, shape, diameters (D) and volume (V) of the coagulation volume were compared in each of the two groups. RESULTS The mean maximum D and V of the coagulations in Group A-2 (4.7 cm and 33.1 cm(3), respectively) were significantly larger than those in Group A-1 (4.1 cm and 20.3 cm(3), respectively) (p<0.05). Furthermore, the mean minimum D, maximum D and V of the coagulations in Group B-2 were significantly larger than those in Group B-1, i.e. 5.3 vs 4.0 cm, 6.6 vs 4.9 cm and 66.9 vs 30.2 cm(3), respectively (p<0.05). The energy efficiencies were also significantly higher in Groups A-2 and B-2 than in Groups A-1 and B-1 (p<0.05).

Acute appendicitis was suspected based on history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ultrasound findings. During laparoscopic surgery, a 5 mm trocar was inserted through the umbilicus and a 5 mm telescope was placed. A 12 mm trocar and a 5 mm grasper were inserted separately through the posterior fornix of the vagina under laparoscopic guidance. The appendix was divided with an endoscopic stapler through the transvaginal 12 mm trocar and removed from the same trocar. The operating time was 75 minutes with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). The patient was discharged 16 hours after surgery uneventfully and she did not require any analgesic administration. Conclusion.

On time follow-up and timely programing of symptoms are important measures to maintain the effectiveness of DBS. Due to the highly contagious nature of 2019-nCoV, patients were quarantined. With the help of Internet technologies, we continued to provide motor and non-motor symptom assessment and remote programming services for postsurgical PD-DBS patients during this extraordinary period. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on postsurgical PD-DBS patients who could not come to our hospital for programming due to the impact of the 2019-nCoV. The differences between the pre- and post-programming groups were analyzed. We designed a 5-level Likert rating scale to evaluate the effects and convenience of the remote programming and Internet self-evaluation procedures. RESULTS: Of the 36 patients engaged in the remote programming, 32 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 32 patients set initiated stimulation parameters, and the other 28 patients had significant improvement in UPDRS-III. Nearly all the 28 patients were satisfied with the effect of the remote programming. Most of the patients were willing to use remote programming again. CONCLUSION: Remote programming based on the online evaluation of patient's symptoms can help improve motor symptoms of postsurgical DBS patients with PD during the quarantine period caused by 2019-nCoV.","output":"Management of Parkinson's disease patients after DBS by remote programming: preliminary application of single center during quarantine of 2019-nCoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 symptoms are routinely required to have chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. COVID-19 infection has been directly related to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe infections lead to admission to intensive care and can also lead to death. The use of clinical data in machine learning models available at time of admission to ED can be used to assess possible risk of ARDS, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as risk of mortality. In addition, chest radiographs can be inputted into a deep learning model to further assess these risks. Purpose: This research aimed to develop machine and deep learning models using both structured clinical data and image data from the electronic health record (EHR) to adverse outcomes following ED admission. Materials and Methods: Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) was used as the main machine learning algorithm using all clinical data including 42 variables. Compact models were also developed using 15 the most important variables to increase applicability of the models in clinical settings. To predict risk of the aforementioned health outcome events, transfer learning from the CheXNet model was implemented on our data as well. This research utilized clinical data and chest radiographs of 3571 patients 18 years and older admitted to the emergency department between 9th March 2020 and 29th October 2020 at Loyola University Medical Center. Main Findings: Our research results show that we can detect COVID-19 infection (AUC = 0.790 (0.746-0.835)) and predict the risk of developing ARDS (AUC = 0.781 (0.690-0.872), ICU admission (AUC = 0.675 (0.620-0.713)), and mortality (AUC = 0.759 (0.678-0.840)) at moderate accuracy from both chest X-ray images and clinical data. Principal Conclusions: The results can help in clinical decision making, especially when addressing ARDS and mortality, during the assessment of patients admitted to the ED with or without COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Image and structured data analysis for prognostication of health outcomes in patients presenting to the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Primary health care (PHC) system is designated to be responsible for epidemic control and prevention during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, while COVID-19 suspected cases in PHC are required to be transferred to specialist fever clinics at higher level hospitals. This study aims to understand to impact of COVID-19 on PHC delivery and antibiotic prescribing at community level in the rural areas of central China. Methods Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 PHC practitioners and seven patients recruited from two township health centres (THCs) and nine village clinics (VCs) in two rural residential areas of Anhui province. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results Practitioners' and patients' views and perspectives on COVID-19 impacts on PHC services and antibiotic prescribing are organised into four broad themes: switch from PHC to epidemic prevention and control, concerns and challenges faced by those delivering PHC, diminished PHC, and COVID-19 as a different class of illness. Conclusion The COVID-19 epidemic has had a considerable impact on the roles of rural PHC clinics in China that shifted to public health from principal medical, and highlighted the difficulties in rural PHC including inadequately trained practitioners, additional work and financial pressure, particularly in VCs. Antibiotic prescribing practices for non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections remained unchanged since the knowledge of COVID-19 was not seen as relevant to practitioners' antibiotic treatment practices, although overall rates were reduced because fewer patients were attending rural PHC clinics. Since COVID-19 epidemic control work has been designated as a long-term task in China, rural PHC clinics now face the challenge of how to balance their principal clinical and public health roles and, in the case of the VCs, remain financially viable.

Another Jupyter notebook trains an LSTM, or a long short-term memory model, to predict a cryptocurrency's closing price. The LSTM is fed the close price, which is the price that the currency has at the end of the day, so it can learn from those values.

Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of RSV patients with ribavirin improve prognosis, even if the use of this drug is limited due to myelosuppression and toxicity effects. Furthermore, effective vaccines to prevent RSV infection are currently unavailable. Thus, the development of highly effective and specific antiviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of RSV infections is a compelling need. In the quest of new RSV inhibitors, in this work we evaluated the antiviral activity of a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives in cell-based assays. Several 1- and 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted fairly potent (M concentrations) inhibitors of RSV infection in plaque reduction assays, accompanied by low cytotoxicity in human highly dividing T lymphoid-derived cells and primary cell lines. Contextually, no inhibitory effects were observed against other RNA or DNA viruses assayed, suggesting specific activity against RSV. Further results revealed that the lead compound 10d was active during the early phase of the RSV infection cycle. To understand whether 10d interfered with virus attachment to target cells or virus-cell fusion events, inhibitory activity tests against the RSV mutant strain B1 cp-52expressing only the F envelope glycoproteinand a plasmid-based reporter assay that quantifies the bioactivity of viral entry were also performed.

We aimed to assess the extent of COVID-19 pulmonary abnormalities on chest x-ray (CXR) using a semiquantitative severity score, correlating it with clinical data and testing its interobserver agreement. METHODS: From February 22 to April 8, 2020, 926 consecutive patients referring to ED of two institutions in Northern Italy for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. Patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR images on ED admission were included (295 patients, median age 69 years, 199 males). Five readers independently and blindly reviewed all CXRs, rating pulmonary parenchymal involvement using a 0C3 semiquantitative score in 1-point increments on 6 lung zones (range 0C18). Interobserver agreement was assessed with weighted Cohens , correlations between median CXR score and clinical data with Spearmans , and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Median score showed negative correlation with SpO(2) ( = -0.242, p < 0.001), positive correlation with white cell count ( = 0.277, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase ( = 0.308, p < 0.001), and C-reactive protein ( = 0.367, p < 0.001), being significantly higher in subsequently dead patients (p = 0.003).

In the current global context of rapidly changing health care systems, there is great need for a standardized definition and integrative framework that can guide implementation. This study aims to propose an accurate and up-to-date definition of care pathway and an integrative conceptual framework. METHODS An innovative hybrid method combining systematic review, concept analysis and bibliometric analysis was undertaken to summarize qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies. Databases searched were PubMed, Embase and ABI/Inform. Methodological quality of included studies was then assessed. RESULTS Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Using concept analysis, we developed a fine-grained understanding, an integrative conceptual framework, and an up-to-date definition of patient-centered care pathway by proposing 28 subcategories grouped into seven attributes. This conceptual framework considers both operational and social realities and supports the improvement and sustainable transformation of clinical, administrative, and organizational practices for the benefit of patients and caregivers, while considering professional experience, organizational constraints, and social dynamics. The proposed attributes of a fluid and effective pathway are (i) the centricity of patients and caregivers, (ii) the positioning of professional actors involved in the care pathway, (iii) the operation management through the care delivery process, (iv) the particularities of coordination structures, (v) the structural context of the system and organizations, (vi) the role of the information system and data management and (vii) the advent of the learning system. Antecedents are presented as key success factors of pathway implementation. By using the consequences and empirical referents, such as outcomes and evidence of care pathway interventions, we went beyond the single theoretical aim, proposing the application of the conceptual framework to healthcare management.

Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-&#945; production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma-obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions. Finally, the return to school activities raises concerns, as asymptomatic children could act as vectors for the spread of the disease. Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

The present study used; BC-GenExMiner, COSMIC, UCSC Xena, The Human Protein Atlas, GEPIA, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER and Oncomine, in order to investigate gene expression, co-expression, clinical parameters and mutations in GINS2 in patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, the present study assessed the prognostic value of GINS2 in patients with breast cancer via the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The results of the present study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GINS2 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. In addition, high mRNA expression levels of GINS2 were associated with high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson status grades, a basal-like status and age (&#8804;51 years); however, it was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis revealed that increased GINS2 mRNA levels were associated with a worse prognosis for relapse-free survival in all patients with breast cancer, particularly in those with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes. In addition, a positive association between the GINS2, CENPM and MCM4 genes was confirmed. The results of the present study suggest that GINS2 could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.

SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement. OBJECTIVE: To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barr, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.

Preclinical studies have suggested that priming the immune system with various modalities in addition to checkpoint inhibition may overcome the relative T-cell exhaustion or senescence; however, in this small data set, radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibition did not appear to activate the antitumor immune response. BACKGROUND: Extramedullary disease (EMD) is recognized as an aggressive subentity of multiple myeloma (MM) with a need for novel therapeutic approaches. We therefore designed a proof-of-principle pilot study to evaluate the synergy between the combination of the anti-PD-L1, avelumab, and concomitant hypofractionated radiotherapy. METHODS: This was a single-arm phase II Simon two-stage single center study that was prematurely terminated because of the COVID-19 pandemic after enrolling four patients. Key eligibility included patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had exhausted or were not candidates for standard therapy and had at least one lesion amenable to radiotherapy. Patients received avelumab until progression or intolerable toxicity and hypofractionated radiotherapy to a focal lesion in cycle 2. Radiotherapy was delayed until cycle 2 to allow the avelumab to reach a study state, given the important observation from previous studies that concomitant therapy is needed for the abscopal effect. RESULTS: At a median potential follow-up of 10.5 months, there were no objective responses, one minimal response, and two stable disease as best response. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-7.1 months), and no deaths occurred. There were no grade &#8805;3 and five grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION: Avelumab in combination with radiotherapy for patients with RRMM and EMD was associated with very modest systemic clinical benefit; however, patients did benefit as usual from local radiotherapy. Furthermore, the combination was very well tolerated compared with historical RRMM treatment regimens.","output":"Avelumab, a PD-L1 Inhibitor, in Combination with Hypofractionated Radiotherapy and the Abscopal Effect in Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this globalized world, the spread of new, exotic and re-emerging diseases has become one of the most important threats to animal production and public health.

In this paper, an epidemic model that incorporates the testing rate as a control input is presented. The proposed model distinguishes between the undetected infected and the detected infected cases with the latter assumed to be isolated from the disease spreading process in the population. Two testing policies, effective during the onset of an epidemic when no treatment or vaccine is available, are devised: (i) best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and (ii) constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST is a suppression policy that provides a lower bound on the testing rate to stop the growth of the epidemic. The COST is a mitigation policy that minimizes the peak of the epidemic by providing a constant, optimal allocation of tests in a certain time interval when the total stockpile of tests is limited.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 urologists in Turkey participated in an online survey between August 22 and September 23, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine the participants demographic characteristics and responses to multiple\\\\choice questions. RESULTS: While 54% of urologists stated that they were concerned about the possibility that the patients planned to undergo MIS were carrying COVID\\\\19 or false\\\\negative for the virus, 51% considered that open surgery was safer than MIS in this regard. The pandemic led to a difference in the preferences of 40% of the urologists in relation to open or MIS methods, and during the pandemic, 39% of the urologists always directed their patients to open surgery. It was determined that during the pandemic, there was a statistical decrease in the intensity and weekly application of MIS methods among all surgical procedures compared to the pre\\\\pandemic (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). MIS was preferred for oncological operations by 97.3% of the urologists during the pandemic, with the most performed operation being radical nephrectomy (90.7%). Among oncological operations, radical prostatectomy was most frequently postponed. To prevent virus transmission during MIS, 44% of the urologists reported that they always used an additional evacuation system and 52% took additional precautions. There were a total of 27 healthcare workers who took part in MIS and tested positive for COVID\\\\19 after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of operations has decreased during the ongoing pandemic, MIS is a method that can be preferred due to its limited contamination and mortality in urology practice provided that safety measures are taken and guideline recommendations are followed.","output":"A nationwide survey on the impact of COVID\\\\19 pandemic on minimal invasive surgery in urology practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still underway.

The most common approved dosing regimen is four intrathecal loading doses of nusinersen 12 mg; the first three are administered at 14-day intervals followed by a fourth dose 30 days later, and then 12-mg maintenance doses are administered every 4 months thereafter. Interruption of nusinersen treatment in the maintenance dosing phase might occur for a number of clinical reasons. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to describe dosing regimens that allow for the most rapid restoration of steady-state concentrations of nusinersen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following a treatment interruption during maintenance dosing. METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic models using integrated pharmacokinetic data from ten nusinersen clinical trials that included a broad range of participants with spinal muscular atrophy treated with intrathecal nusinersen were used to investigate different durations of treatment interruptions during maintenance treatment. Potential dosing regimens for re-initiation of nusinersen were evaluated, with the goal of achieving the quickest restoration of steady-state nusinersen CSF concentrations without exceeding maximal CSF exposures observed during the initial loading period. RESULTS: Our pharmacokinetic modeling indicates the following regimen will lead to optimal restoration of nusinersen CSF levels after treatment interruption: two doses of nusinersen should be administered at 14-day intervals following treatment interruptions of  8 to < 16 months since the last dose, and three doses of nusinersen at 14-day intervals for treatment interruptions of  16 to < 40 months since the last maintenance dose, with subsequent maintenance dosing every 4 months in both instances.

Neutralizing antibody titers to BCV and BVDV were determined for 852 animals from 3 Ontario feedlots.

This evidence of previous exposure to both viruses was associated with reduced subsequent UBRD risk. Evidence of exposure to BCV during the study period was common, as 50% of animals showed a 16-fold or greater titer increase; however, treatment for UBRD was not associated with titer change. Although the majority of animals were vaccinated for BVDV at arrival, within a feedlot, animals treated for UBRD had larger titer increases to BVDV than non-treated animals.

The evaluation of alternative NPIs is needed to confront the pandemic with less disruption. By harnessing human mobility data, we develop an agent-based model that can evaluate the efficacies of NPIs with individualized mobility simulations. Based on the model, we propose data-driven targeted interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong without city-wide NPIs. We develop a data-driven agent-based model for 7.55106 Hong Kong residents to evaluate the efficacies of various NPIs in the first 80 days of the initial outbreak. The entire territory of Hong Kong has been split into 4905 500500m2 grids. The model can simulate detailed agent interactions based on the demographics data, public facilities and functional buildings, transportation systems, and travel patterns. The general daily human mobility patterns are adopted from Google's Community Mobility Report. The scenario without any NPIs is set as the baseline. By simulating the epidemic progression and human movement at the individual level, we propose model-driven targeted interventions which focus on the surgical testing and quarantine of only a small portion of regions instead of enforcing NPIs in the whole city. The effectiveness of common NPIs and the proposed targeted interventions are evaluated by 100 extensive simulations. The proposed model can inform targeted interventions, which are able to effectively contain the COVID-19 outbreak with much lower disruption of the city.

Pneumonia FilmArray? panel (BPFA) multiplex PCR platform and presents an approach for integrating BPFA results as a foundation for subsequent antibiotic stewardship (AS) activities. METHODS: Between January 2017 to March 2018, all patients admitted for CAP were enrolled. Patients were considered evaluable if all elements of the MTB and the BPFA were completed, and they met other a priori inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the percentage of potential pathogens detected using the MTB (8 viral and 6 bacterial targets) versus the BPFA (8 viral and 18 bacterial targets). Blood and sputum cultures were performed on all patients. Two or more procalcitonin (PCT) levels assisted clinical assessments as to whether detected bacteria were invading or colonizing. RESULTS: Of 585 enrolled patients, 274 were evaluable. A potential viral pathogen was detected in 40.5% with MTB versus 60.9% of patients with BPFA with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 9.00 (4.12 to 23.30) p<0.01.

A robust and up to date overview of empirical evidence assessing and substantiating health equity impact of health insurance schemes among specific vulnerable populations in LMICs beyond the more common parameters, such as income level, is lacking. We fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of how social inclusion affects access to equitable health financing arrangements in LMIC. METHODS We searched 11 databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 1995 and January 2018 that addressed the enrolment and impact of health insurance in LMIC for the following vulnerable groups: female-headed households, children with special needs, older adults, youth, ethnic minorities, migrants, and those with a disability or chronic illness. We assessed health insurance enrolment patterns of these population groups and its impact on health care utilization, financial protection, health outcomes and quality of care. RESULTS The comprehensive database search resulted in 44 studies, in which chronically ill were mostly reported (67%), followed by older adults (33%). Scarce and inconsistent evidence is available for individuals with disabilities, female-headed households, ethnic minorities and displaced populations, and no studies were yielded reporting on youth or children with special needs. Enrolment rates seemed higher among chronically ill and mixed or insufficient results are observed for the other groups. Most studies reporting on health care utilization found an increase in health care utilization for insured individuals with a disability or chronic illness and older adults. In general, health insurance schemes seemed to prevent catastrophic health expenditures to a certain extent. However, reimbursements rates were very low and vulnerable individuals had increased out of pocket payments. CONCLUSION Despite a sizeable literature published on health insurance, there is a dearth of good quality evidence, especially on equity and the inclusion of specific vulnerable groups in LMIC. Evidence should be strengthened within health care reform to achieve UHC, by redefining and assessing vulnerability as a multidimensional process and the investigation of mechanisms that are more context specific.","output":"Leaving no one behind?

However, NGS implementation, and therefore patient access, varies across Europe; a multi-stakeholder collaboration is needed to establish the conditions required to improve this discrepancy. In that regard, we set up European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM)-led expert panels during the first half of 2021, including key stakeholders from across 10 European countries covering medical, economic, patient, industry, and governmental expertise. We describe the outcomes of these panels in order to define and explore the necessary conditions for NGS implementation into routine clinical care to enable patient access, identify specific challenges in achieving them, and make short- and long-term recommendations. The main challenges identified relate to the demand for NGS tests (governance, clinical standardization, and awareness and education) and supply of tests (equitable reimbursement, infrastructure for conducting and validating tests, and testing access driven by evidence generation). Recommendations made to resolve each of these challenges should aid multi-stakeholder collaboration between national and European initiatives, to complement, support, and mutually reinforce efforts to improve patient care.","output":"Identifying the Steps Required to Effectively Implement Next-Generation Sequencing in Oncology at a National Level in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread adverse collateral effects on health care delivery for non-COVID-19 disease conditions. Paediatric oncology care is reliant on prompt testing and diagnosis and on timely and coordinated multimodal treatment, all of which have been impacted by the pandemic. This study aimed to quantify the initial and enduring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of paediatric cancer care and to examine whether the pandemic differentially impacted specific demographic groups. METHOD: We performed an interrupted time series analysis using negative binomial regression to estimate the change in the monthly admissions for paediatric cancer patients (Age 0-17) associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown policies. We obtained data from deidentified individual electronic medical records of paediatric cancer inpatients admitted between January 1, 2015 and May 31, 2021 to a tertiary hospital that provides general and specialized healthcare services to an estimated population of 8.4 million in Jining China. Relative risk (RR) estimates representing monthly admissions compared with expected admissions had the pandemic not occurred were derived. The number of inpatient admissions lost due to the pandemic were estimated. FINDINGS: The overall denominator for the paediatric population was 1 858 209 individuals in January 2015, which increased to 2 043 803 by May 2021. In total, there were 4 901 admissions for paediatric cancer during the study period, including 1 479 (30%) since February 2020 when the lockdown was implemented. A 33% reduction (95% CI: -43% to -22%) in admissions was observed in February 2020, with the largest relative reduction (-48%, 95% CI: -64% to -24%) among first-time admissions and admissions for patients from rural districts (-46%, 95% CI: -55% to -36%). Admissions quickly rebounded in March 2020 when many government-imposed mobility restrictions were lifted, and continued to resume gradually over time since April 2020, leading to a full recovery as of November 2020. However, the recovery for first-time admissions, and among female patients, younger patients (<5 years) and patients from rural districts was slower over time and incomplete (first-time admissions and rural patients) as of January 2021. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impact on the timely utilization of paediatric oncology services in China, particularly in the early stage of the first wave. Importantly, some population groups were disproportionately affected and the recovery of admissions among those subgroups has been slow and incomplete, warranting targeted approaches to address potentially exacerbated gender and socio-economic inequalities in access to healthcare resources.","output":"Unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric cancer care: a population-based cohort study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by massive inflammation of the arterial endothelium accompanied by vasoconstriction and widespread pulmonary micro thrombi As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide (*NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O2*-), pulmonary *NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients Introducing *NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived *NO The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method's efficacy INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients However, due to the rapid inactivation of *NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of *NO will not protect remote organs Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O2*--driven destruction of *NO by neutralizing inflammatory O2*- By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e g , AEOL 10150), salen type (e g , EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e g , M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate-MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO From the authors' viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 Five days after submission of the current manuscript, Galera Pharmaceuticals Inc announced the dosing of the first patient in a randomized, double-blind pilot phase II clinical trial with GC4419 for COVID-19 The study was first posted on ClinicalTrials gov (Identifier: NCT04555096) 18 September 2020","output":"May Mangafodipir or Other SOD Mimetics Contribute to Better Care in COVID-19 Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a common complication of cancer treatment causing chemotherapy delays, dose reductions, and treatment discontinuation, negatively impacting treatment outcomes and putting patients at risk for bleeding complications.

For this review, a PubMed/MEDLINE literature search was undertaken for relevant articles published from 1995-2021. EXPERT OPINION After over two decades of drug development for CIT, multiple clinical trials and observational studies have found TPO-RAs, in particular romiplostim, to be safe and effective agents to manage patients with CIT, although no agent is yet FDA-approved for this indication. Active management of CIT with TPO-RAs is likely to improve oncologic outcomes, although additional data is needed.

Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in elite futsal players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-Recent world events (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) led to an unparalleled situation in sports. Players were forced to stay at home for a prolonged period and not allowed to use their team's training facilities or even exercise outdoors. The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in futsal players. Ten elite male players performed a 10-m sprint, horizontal and vertical jump, and body composition measurements before and after the quarantine (i.e., 70 days). Pre-post confinement differences in horizontal jump distance, countermovement jump variables, sprinting time, and body composition were analyzed by a paired sample t-test and effect sizes (ESs). A large and significant decline was observed in sprint ability (p = 0.004; ES = 1.31). Small and nonsignificant differences were found in horizontal jump performance (p = 0.243; ES = -0.39). Nonsignificant differences were observed in countermovement jump (CMJ) height (p = 0.076; ES = -0.63) but moderate-to-large significant declines were found in CMJ eccentric deceleration impulse, rate of force development, peak power, velocity, and landing peak force (p &#8804; 0.05; ES = -0.52 - 1.23). Finally, trivial and nonsignificant differences were obtained on body composition parameters. In summary, sprint performance and specific CMJ kinetic variables were significantly affected by long-term reduced training, whereas vertical jump height and horizontal jump distance and body composition were not. Practitioners are advised to implement efficient sprint-oriented and eccentric-oriented training strategies to optimize return to competition after prolonged detraining periods.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Neuromuscular Performance and Body Composition in Elite Futsal Players"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among 275 patients with COVID-19, we found that median blood zinc level was significantly lower in patients with poor clinical outcome (N=75) as compared to patients with good clinical outcome (N=200) (840 g/L versus 970 g/L; p< 0.0001), suggesting that zinc supplementation could be useful for patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Low blood zinc concentrations in patients with poor clinical outcome during SARS-CoV-2 infection: is there a need to supplement with Zinc COVID-19 patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Induction of protective mucosal T cell memory remains a formidable challenge to vaccinologists Using a combination adjuvant strategy that elicits potent CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, we define the tenets of vaccine-induced pulmonary T cell immunity An acrylic-acid-based adjuvant (ADJ), in combination with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA) or CpG, promotes mucosal imprinting but engages distinct transcription programs to drive different degrees of terminal differentiation and disparate polarization of TH1/TC1/TH17/TC17 effector/memory T cells Combination of ADJ with GLA, but not CpG, dampens T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, mitigates terminal differentiation of effectors, and enhances the development of CD4 and CD8 TRM cells that protect against H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses Mechanistically, vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells play a vital role in optimal programming of CD8 TRM and viral control Taken together, these findings provide further insights into vaccine-induced multifaceted mucosal T cell immunity with implications in the development of vaccines against respiratorypathogens, including influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2","output":"Programming Multifaceted Pulmonary T Cell Immunity by Combination Adjuvants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused ongoing challenges in health services worldwide.

Firstly, the high number of cases overwhelms diagnostic test capacity and proposes the need for a rapid solution for sample processing (Science 2018;360:444-8). Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus species and subspecies, so detection assays can give false-positive results if they are not efficiently specific to SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (MedRxiv 2020a;1-18).

METHODS: This is a case-control study involved 169 Saudi subjects with different L. species and 199 healthy controls from central region of Saudi Arabia. All subjects were characterized by TNF- ? 308 G/A and IFN- + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms using PCR. RESULTS: Evaluation of genotyping and allelic frequency of TNF- ? 308 G/A in different L. species showed no significant association compared to controls (p > 0.05). Except, in cases of L. tropica that showed significantly higher TNF- ? 308 A versus G allele frequency (p = 0.0004). Evaluation of genotyping of IFN- + 874 (TT versus AA+AT recessive) and allelic frequency of IFN- + 874 (T versus A) showed significant higher in L. major and also in total CL cases as compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a strong association was observed between the susceptibility of L. major, L. tropica or total CL cases with synergistically combined high TNF- 308/INF- 874 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that shows the gene polymorphisms of TNF- ? 308 G/A and IFN- + 874 A/T in Saudi patients with different L. species infections. Data showed that the TNF--308 G/A gene polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility of CL in Saudi subjects. The only correlation was found in between A versus G allelic frequency in L. tropica. Importantly, IFN- + 874 A/T polymorphism was found to be associated with the susceptibility of L. major and also with total CL subjects. Moreover, data from synergistically combined high TNF- 308/INF- 874 alleles strongly suggest their potential role in the susceptibility of leishmania infection.","output":"TNF- ? 308 G/A and IFN- + 874 A/T gene polymorphisms in Saudi patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics are associated with increased rates of intimate partner violence (IPV).

METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess COVID-19 incidence rates in Egypt, Tunisia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa (SA). Data were collected between 14 February and 19 July 2020 from online data repositories. The linear trend and magnitude of change were evaluated using the itsa function with ordinary least-squares regression in Stata with a 7-d deferred interruption point, which allows a period of diffusion post-border closure. RESULTS: Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19 after border closure. However, when compared with matched control groups, SA, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and Kenya showed a higher incidence rate trend. In contrast, Ethiopia, DRC and Tunisia showed a lower trend compared with their controls. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of COVID-19. The inclusion of other control measures such as enhanced testing capacity and improved surveillance activities will reveal the effectiveness of border closure measures.","output":"Evaluation of the effect of border closure on COVID-19 incidence rates across nine African countries: an interrupted time series study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hem-o-lok clips have been widely used in laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery.

Body-weight-support systems (BWSSs) minimize this risk and allow patients to safely practice balance activities during therapy. Treadmill based balance perturbation systems with BWSSs are known to improve balance in patients with age or disease related impairments. However, these stationary systems are unable accommodate complex exercises requiring more freedom of movement. Objective: To evaluate the impact of a new balance perturbation module, which is directly integrated to a track-mounted BWSS, has on patient balance after acute stroke. Design: Unblinded quasi-randomized controlled pilot study. Setting: Rehabilitation centered long-term acute care hospital. Participants: Stroke rehabilitation inpatients with an admission Berg Balance Scale (BBS) assessment score of 21/56 or greater. Interventions: BWSS and BWSS with perturbation (BWSS-P) training was incorporated into participants regular treatment. While both groups conducted the same balance and gait activities during their treatment sessions, the BWSS-P sessions included lateral and anterior/posterior resistive or assistive balance perturbations. Main outcome measures: BBS and Activities-Specific Balance-Confidence (ABC) assessments were the main outcome measure collected. Institutional BBS data from fiscal-year 2018, prior to installation of the track mounted BWSS, was used as a historical standard-of-care (SOC) baseline. Results: Improved post-intervention BBS and ABC assessment scores showed all participants benefited from therapy (p[]0.0438). The BBS percent-change of the BWSS-P [mean(SD)n] [66.95%(43.78%)14] and BWSS control [53.29%(24.13%)15] were greater than the SOC group [28.31%(17.25%)30] (p[]0.0178), with no difference between BWSS groups (p=0.6669); ABC percent score-changes were also similar (p[]0.8036). Conclusions: BWSS groups demonstrated similar BBS and ABC score improvements, indicating balance perturbations are not detrimental to post-acute stroke rehabilitation and are safe to use. This data provides strong rationale for conducting a larger follow-up study to further assess if this new perturbation system provides additional benefit to stroke patient balance during rehabilitation.

Owing to their hydrophobic nature, they are thought to perturb the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. Against such antibiotic challenges, bacteria develop mechanisms for cell envelope stress responses (CESR). In Bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive sporulating soil bacterium, the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor-mediated response system plays a pivotal role in CESR. Among them, M is strongly involved in response to cell envelope stress, including a shortage of available bactoprenol. Vetiver essential oil, a product of Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty root, is also known to possess bactericidal activity. M was exclusively and strongly induced when the cells were exposed to Vetiver extract, and depletion of multi-ECF sigma factors (sigM, sigW, sigX, and sigV) enhanced sensitivity to it. From this quadruple mutant strain, the suppressor strains, which restored resistance to the bactericidal activity of Vetiver extract, emerged, although attempts to obtain resistant strains from the wild type did not succeed. Whole-genome resequencing of the suppressor strains and genetic analysis revealed inactivation of xseB or pnpA, which code for exodeoxyribonuclease or polynucleotide phosphorylase, respectively. This allowed the quadruple mutant strain to escape from cell death caused by Vetiver extract. Composition analysis suggested that the sesquiterpene, khusimol, might contribute to the bactericidal activity of the Vetiver extract.","output":"Analysis of cell death in Bacillus subtilis caused by sesquiterpenes from Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.)

Typically, the treatment provided is a 25g ampule of 50% dextrose (D50). This dose of D50 is meant to ensure a return to consciousness. However, this dose may cause harm and lead to difficulties regulating blood glucose levels (BGLs) post-treatment. It is hypothesized that a lower concentration, such as 10% dextrose (D10), may improve symptoms while minimizing harm. METHODS PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central were systematically searched on September 15, 2020. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. GRADE and risk of bias were applied to determine the certainty of the evidence. Primary literature investigating the use of IV dextrose in hypoglycemic diabetic patients presenting to paramedics or the emergency department was included. Outcomes of interest included safety, efficacy (symptom resolution), and BGL. RESULTS Of 680 abstracts screened, 51 full-text articles were reviewed, with eleven studies included. Data from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies were analyzed. A single RCT comparing D10 to D50 was identified. The primary significant finding of the study was an increased post-treatment glycemic profile by 3.2mmol/L in the D50 group; no other outcomes had significant differences between groups. When comparing pooled data from all the included studies, there was greater symptom resolution in the D10 group (95.9%) compared to the D50 group (88.8%). However, the mean time to resolution was approximately four minutes longer in the D10 group (4.1 minutes [D50] versus 8.0 minutes [D10]). There was a greater need for subsequent doses with the use of D10 (19.5%) compared to D50 (8.1%). The post-treatment glycemic profile was lower in the D10 group at 6.2mmol/L versus 8.5mmol/L in the D50 group. Both treatments had nearly complete resolution of hypoglycemia: 98.7% (D50) and 99.2% (D10). No adverse events were observed in the D10 group (0/1057) compared to 13/310 adverse events in the D50 group. CONCLUSION Studies show D10 may be as effective as D50 at resolving symptoms and correcting hypoglycemia. Although the desired effect can take several minutes longer, there appear to be fewer adverse events. The post-D10-treatment BGL may result in fewer untoward hyperglycemic episodes.","output":"Dextrose 50% versus Dextrose 10% or Dextrose Titration for the Treatment of Out-of-Hospital Hypoglycemia: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Up to 25% of ovulating women suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, a condition associated with pain and transient-reduced quality of life, along with greater irritability and impaired sleep.

To this end, we conducted a double-blind cross-over clinical trial lasting for three menstrual cycles. A total of 14 women (mean age M = 27.5 years) with primary dysmenorrhea took part in the study. At baseline, that is, during the first menstruation, they completed a visual analogue scale to rate pain; sleep continuity was assessed via actigraphs, and overall sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Next, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either melatonin during the second, and meloxicam during the third menstruation, or meloxicam during the second, and melatonin during the third menstruation. Neither participants nor investigators were aware of participants' study assignment. During the second and third menstruations, the assessments described above were repeated.

RESULTS: There were 542 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an average age of 62.8 years. Of these, 395 had blood cultures performed upon admission, with six true positive results (1.1% of the total population). An additional 14 patients had positive respiratory cultures treated as true pathogens in the first 72 h. Low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate were statistically significantly associated with bacteremia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All adult patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [37-58] years) consecutively admitted to the Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-five patients (23.1%) developed severe disease, and of those 12 patients (48%) died. Advanced age, comorbidities (most commonly hypertension), higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of COVID-19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level.

There is a trend towards minimizing the number of incisions such as natural transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC). Many retrospective case series propose excellent cosmesis and reduced pain in SPLC. As the latter has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial, patient's satisfaction on cosmesis is still controversially debated. METHODS/DESIGN The SPOCC trial is a prospective, multi-center, double blinded, randomized controlled study comparing SPLC with 4-port conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (4PLC) in elective surgery. The hypothesis and primary objective is that patients undergoing SPLC will have a better outcome in cosmesis and body image 12 weeks after surgery. This primary endpoint is assessed using a validated 8-item multiple choice type questionnaire on cosmesis and body image. The secondary endpoint has three entities: the quality of life 12 weeks after surgery assessed by the validated Short-Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire, postoperative pain assessed by a visual analogue scale and the use of analgesics. Operative time, surgeon's experience with SPLC and 4PLC, use of additional ports, conversion to 4PLC or open cholecystectomy, length of stay, costs, time of work as well as intra- and postoperative complications are further aspects of the secondary endpoint.

Before COVID-19, it rarely received public attention, even when it occurred in everyday practices, mainly in the form of implicit rationing, as it continues to do today. There are different definitions, types and levels of healthcare rationing, according to different perspectives. With the aim of contributing to a more coherent debate on such a highly emotional healthcare issue as rationing, here are provided a number of reflections from a patient advocate perspective which are specifically focused on bedside rationing, the most troublesome level, both for patients and clinicians, particularly in regard to cancer care. Oncology, with its numerous expensive therapies and increasing number of patients, is undeniably one of the main areas contributing to the increase in healthcare costs. However, the fixed budgets of today's publicly financed health systems cannot allow unlimited access to the potentially beneficial treatments to all patients. Bedside rationing constitutes the last phase of many decision-making processes occurring at different interrelated levels (macro-levels), both inside and outside healthcare systems, which implicitly and inevitably result in a bottleneck determined by the upstream decisions themselves. Shifting from implicit to explicit bedside rationing essentially means moving from a paternalistic to a citizen-before-patient approach;this implies, first of all, a cultural change. Practical bedside rationing is an ethically complex topic, but one that needs to be urgently addressed in a transparent and open debate. In this scenario, the oncological community ? patients, patient advocates and clinicians ? can and should play an important role.","output":"Bedside rationing in cancer care: Patient advocate perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be effective to combat the pandemic and to prevent severe disease but their distribution proceeds in a context of global vaccine shortage Their uneven distribution favors the appearance of new variants of concern, as the highly transmissible Delta variant, affecting especially non-vaccinated people. We consider that devising reliable models to analyse the spread of the different variants is crucial. These models should include the effects of vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical measures used to contain the pandemic by modifying social behaviour. In this work, we present a stochastic geographical model that fulfills these requirements. It consists of an extended compartmental model that includes various strains and vaccination strategies, allowing to study the emergence and dynamics of the new COVID-19 variants. The models conveniently separates the parameters related to the disease from the ones related to social behavior and mobility restrictions. The geographical spread of the virus is modeled taking into account the actual population distribution in any given country of interest. Here we choose the UK as model system, taking advantage of the reliable available data, in order to fit the recurrence of the currently prevalent variants. Our computer simulations allow to describe some global features observed in the daily number of cases, as the appearance of periodic waves and the features that determine the prevalence of certain variants. They also provide useful predictions aiming to help planning future vaccination boosters. We stress that the model could be applied to any other country of interest.","output":"Modelling the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rapid changes in globalization and technology advancement, self-directed learning is argued repeatedly as a key competency needed to survive in the twenty-first century. In August 2019, the Taiwan Ministry of Education implemented the new Curriculum Guidelines for 12-Year Basic Education. Being Taiwans first official curriculum that promoted self-directed learning, this study contributed to the emerging knowledge of how the introduction of the curriculum guidelines affected students readiness for self-directed learning. Three cohorts of high school students from seven schools returned 10,020 valid surveys. The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), a reputable instrument developed by Lucy Guglielmino (2000), was used in the study. The results provided a birds-eye view of evidence supporting our explanations for the positive, though slight, effect of implementing new curriculum guidelines in fostering self-directed high-school learners. Moreover, the progression of self-directed learning readiness appeared differently among schools and among different demographic associations. We suggest that future researchers both (a) qualitatively explore how specific latent variables were changed in different instructional interventions, and (b) conduct panel studies to advance our understanding of curriculum reform and learners self-direction.

However, SS also affects many extraglandular systems. In SS patients, the pattern of extraglandular manifestations may have a close similarity with the vasculitic features seen in SLE patients that are mediated by immune complexes and complement. However, SS patients also have an increased frequency of lymphocytic infiltration into extraglandular tissues, as might be expected by their increased frequency of lymphoma in comparison to SLE patients. For example, SS patients need to be evaluated for interstitial nephritis (in contrast to the glomerulonephritis of SLE) or interstitial pneumonitis (in comparison to pleurisy of SLE). This chapter will focus on the clinical extraglandular manifestations of primary SS that are not specifically covered in other chapters. These extraglandular manifestations have led to a recently introduced disease activity and organ damage index. The recognition of these extraglandular manifestations is important since they have prognostic and therapeutic implications. The differential diagnosis of these extraglandular manifestations includes overlapping features with other autoimmune diseases (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, dermatomyositis, celiac sprue, and small- and medium-sized vessel vasculitis), infectious diseases that mimic autoimmune disease (particularly hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis), and predisposition to drug toxicities that may involve extraglandular organs (particularly skin rashes, nephritis, pneumonitis, myositis, and hematopoietic abnormalities).","output":"Extraglandular Manifestations of Sj?grens Syndrome (SS): Dermatologic, Arthritic, Endocrine, Pulmonary, Cardiovascular, Gastroenterology, Renal, Urology, and Gynecologic Manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood flow partially determines specific climbing endurance (SCE) as it mediates oxygen bio-availability in the finger flexors. Blood flow is related to occlusion threshold (OT), which is defined as the contraction intensity at which intramuscular pressure exceeds perfusion blood pressure resulting in the cessation of local blood flow. The OT is represented as an inflection point on a force-time graph when isometric force is registered and applied through maximal and continuous tests. Endurance time (ET) to exhaustion is influenced by the relative isometric applied force and is different for each climber. The aim of this study was to explore whether an approximation of the finger flexo?s OT in sport climbers through records of ET to exhaustion at different isometric relative intensities was possible. We measured maximum finger hang ETs at 6 intensities ranging from 85% to 35% maximal force in 34 sport climbers of advanced and elite level. The values obtained were analyzed by two different methods in an attempt to determine a change in the shape of the curve in the intensity-ET relationship graphs that approximated the OT for each climber. The results suggest that the finger flexo?s OT could be different among climbers, regardless of their strength and ability level. The presented methods do not accurately reflect the OT, but could indicate the intensity at which blood flow is restored in the active muscles. This is the first study to indirectly approximate the finger flexors OT in sport-climbers, a parameter that could be essential to assess SCE.","output":"The finger flexors occlusion threshold in sport-climbers: an exploratory study on its indirect approximation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has impacted educational systems worldwide during 2020, including primary and secondary schooling.

Most centers have canceled elective surgeries. Surgical demonstration and hands-on training of postgraduate residents are challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued training of residents is of utmost importance in terms of time and skill development. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common and important surgeries in ENT. Resident training of tonsillectomy is essential. Here, we present a simple, inexpensive model for tonsillectomy hands-on training addressing critical steps of the surgery.

This assay can be completed in two steps in a label-free fashion, yielding a \\"signal-on\\" signal readout, which usually cannot be attained by electrochemical label-free detection using no labels or markers to tag the target protein. The proposed assay also utilizes no antibodies or enzyme-based reagents. The method achieves this performance by moderating the frequency of electrochemical potential scanning such that the scanning rate keeps pace with, or \\"resonances\\" with, the molecular motion of the probe molecule. This method has been successfully applied to detect the three target proteins in serum samples collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results indicate a strong correlation with the risk of deteriorating into severe acute conditions after virus infection.

The task was complicated by the fact that resurfacing arthroplasty is commonly offered only to a subset of patients who are candidates for total hip replacement, often prohibiting direct comparisons. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to address four key questions addressing revision rates, patient characteristics, effectiveness of treatment, and whether improved technique, surgeon experience, and/or patient selection lead to improved outcomes. Despite data limitations, it is apparent that revision rates are higher after resurfacing than after total hip arthroplasty. Potential prognostic indicators did not yield a consistent predictor of patient-oriented outcomes (eg, pain relief) for either resurfacing arthroplasty or total hip replacement. Because of differences between patients who received hip resurfacing and those who received total hip arthroplasty, the results of studies comparing these techniques cannot be interpreted. Finally, changes in technique and increased experience result in a decrease in revision rates and femoral neck fractures and improved pain and hip scores in resurfacing.","output":"Modern metal-on-metal hip resurfacing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El neumomediastino espontneo se define como la presencia de aire o gas en el mediastino de forma primaria.

Over the course of 53 days, the floodwaters of Harvey delivered 14  109 m3 of freshwater to Galveston Bay. This resulted in record flooding of Houston bayous and waterways, all of which drained into the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE,) with its main tributaries being Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. The lower SJE and lower Buffalo Bayou has experienced up to 3 m of land subsidence in the past 100 years and, as a result, prior to Hurricane Harvey, up to 2 m of sediment within the upper seabed contained an archive of high concentrations of Total Hg (HgT) and other particle-bound and porewater contaminants. Within the SJE, Harvey eroded at least 48 cm of the sediment column, resulting in the transport of an estimated 16.4  106 tons of sediment and at least 2 tons of Hg into Galveston Bay. This eroded sediment was replaced by a Harvey storm deposit of 7.73  106 tons of sediment and 0.96 tons within the SJE, mostly sourced from Buffalo Bayou. Considering that the frequency of slow-moving tropical cyclones capable of delivering devastating rainfall may be increasing, then one can expect that delivery of Hg and other contaminants from the archived sediment within urbanized estuaries will increase and that what happened during Harvey is a harbinger of what is to come.","output":"How tropical cyclone flooding caused erosion and dispersal of mercury-contaminated sediment in an urban estuary: The impact of Hurricane Harvey on Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto Estuary, Galveston Bay, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of COVID-19, there was widespread cessation of face-to-face teaching in medical schools from March 2020 130 students in their first clinical year at a large London medical school were at risk of missing part of their clinical and practical procedure teaching We mailed a teaching pack containing clinical consumables and gave instructions to prepare fruit, vegetables and kitchen sponges as a replacement for manikins Students used cucumbers for bladder catheterisation, oranges for injections, bananas for suturing and cannulated sponges for practising intravenous drug administration A student evaluation after the course was favourable Hands-on practice had a positive effect on the students' feelings of belongingness and identity and helped them feel like they were not missing out or being left behind Technology was challenging for both students and tutors The intervention is being repeated for all incoming students from September 2020","output":"'You've got mail!': Clinical and practical skills teaching re-imagined during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is continuously evolving.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies measuring the accuracy of the various tests are usually underpowered and inconsistent, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted the literature search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. For the statistical analysis we used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA) and the point-of-care (POC) Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA) that are based on immunochromatography. In total, we identified 38 eligible studies that include data from 7,848 individuals. The analyses showed that tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones, and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone. All methods yielded high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods performed better in terms of sensitivity (90-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 86%.

METHODS: PACTR was established in 2007 as the AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Clinical Trials Registry. The scope of the registry was then expanded in 2009 to include all diseases. This is a cross-sectional study of trials registered in PACTR from inception to 18 August 2021. A descriptive analysis of the use and trends of the following data fields: study intervention, disease condition, sex of the participants, sample size, ethics, funding and availability of results was conducted using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: The number of trials registered has increased year on year, reaching 606 trials registered in 2020. The total number of trials registered at the time of the analysis was 2998. More than half of the trials in the registry (1655 of 2998, ie, 55%) were prospectively registered. Ethical approval was received by 90% (2691 of 2998) of the registered trials.

Overall 1,082 (48.3%) stressed their intention to get vaccinated (64.4% for Greece and 34.9% for Republic of Cyprus). The main reasons for those who intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine include self (94.2%), family (98.7%), and patients protection (95.2%) as well as mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic (95.4%). The multivariate logistic regression that was performed for the total sample revealed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased probability to get vaccinated against COVID-19: being a physician, a member of the nursing personnel, paramedical staff, working in Greece, age, the belief that influenza vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and the rating of the overall management of COVID-19 pandemic in the country and from the public hospitals. Physicians were more likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than other HCP. The age was a predictor of COVID-19 uptake intention in the Republic of Cyprus. The belief that there was a successful management of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the intention to COVID-19 vaccination uptake.","output":"A comparative online survey on the intention to get COVID-19 vaccine between Greek and Cypriot healthcare personnel: is the country a predictor?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of COVID-19 requires alternative treatments based on the reuse of drugs as a strategy to prevent the progression of the disease in patients infected with SARS-COV-2. The goal was to evaluate the use of ivermectin in mild stage outpatients to heal and / or reverse the progression of COVID-19 disease towards the development of moderate or severe stages. Methods: Cluster Assigned Clinical Trial (2:1) in outpatients, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n = 110) and control groups (CG: n = 62). The EG received ivermectin orally 4 drops of 6 mg = 24 mg every 7 days for 4 weeks. All participants were diagnosed by positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and were evaluated by clinical examination, at the beginning and the end of protocol. Data analyzed were applied the proportion, bivariate, and logical regression tests with level significance p < 0.05. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04784481. Findings: Both groups were similar in age, sex, and comorbidities (EG: 56F, median age= 40.0, range: 18.0 - 75.0; CG: 34F, median age = 37.5, range: 18.0 - 71.0). A significant reduction in the symptom numbers was observed in the EG when the medical examination was performed from 5th to 9th days, after starting treatment (p = 0.0026). Although, medical examination from 10th to 14th day, showed a progressive reduction of the percentage symptom numbers, these were not significative in both groups. A higher proportion of medical release was observed in EG (98.2%) vs CG (87.1%) (p = 0.003). EG showed 8 times more chance of receiving medical release than CG (OR 7.99, 95% CI: 1.64 -38.97, p = 0.003). The treatment effect with ivermectin to obtain medical release was analyzed by the logistic regression model based in the following control variables: sex, age, and comorbidities. Then, the chance to obtain medical release was maintained in EG (OR 10.37, 95% CI: 2.05 - 52.04, p = 0.005). Interpretation: Treatment with ivermectin in outpatients with mild stage COVID-19 disease managed to slightly reduce the symptom numbers. Also, this treatment improved the clinical state to obtain medical release, even in the presence of comorbidities. The treatment with ivermectin could significantly prevent the evolution to serious stages since the EG did not present any patient with referral to critical hospitalization.","output":"IVERMECTIN REPROPOSING FOR COVID-19 TREATMENT OUTPATIENTS IN MILD STAGE IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTERS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of February 2020, Daegu faced a serious situation due to the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.

Although two SARS-related Rhinolophus sinicus bat CoVs (SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs) previously detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Yunnan, RsSHC014 and Rs3367, possessed 95% genome identities to human and civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 protein exhibited only 32.2 to 33% amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. To elucidate the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8, we sampled 348 bats of various species in Yunnan, among which diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including potentially novel CoVs, were identified, with some showing potential interspecies transmission. The genomes of two betacoronaviruses, SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C, from greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), possessed 93% nucleotide identities to human/civet SARSr-CoV genomes. Although these two betacoronaviruses displayed lower similarities than SARSr-Rs-BatCoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367 in S protein to civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 proteins demonstrated exceptionally high (80.4 to 81.3%) amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs, compared to SARSr-BatCoVs from other horseshoe bats (23.2 to 37.3%). Potential recombination events were identified around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. The expression of ORF8 subgenomic mRNA suggested that the ORF8 protein may be functional in SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs. The high Ka/Ks ratio among human SARS-CoVs compared to that among SARSr-BatCoVs supported that ORF8 is under strong positive selection during animal-to-human transmission. Molecular clock analysis using ORF1ab showed that SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C diverged from civet/human SARSr-CoVs in approximately 1990. SARS-CoV ORF8 originated from SARSr-CoVs of greater horseshoe bats through recombination, which may be important for animal-to-human transmission. IMPORTANCE Although horseshoe bats are the primary reservoir of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), it is still unclear how these bat viruses have evolved to cross the species barrier to infect civets and humans. Most human SARS-CoV epidemic strains contain a signature 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8, compared to civet SARSr-CoVs, suggesting that ORF8 may be important for interspecies transmission. However, the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8 remains obscure. In particular, SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) exhibited <40% amino acid identities to human/civet SARS-CoV in the ORF8 protein. We detected diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses among various bat species in Yunnan, China, including two SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs from greater horseshoe bats that possessed ORF8 proteins with exceptionally high amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. We demonstrated recombination events around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. Our findings offer insight into the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV ORF8 protein, which was likely acquired from SARSr-CoVs of greater horseshoe bats through recombination.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus ORF8 Protein Is Acquired from SARS-Related Coronavirus from Greater Horseshoe Bats through Recombination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The on-going COVID-19 outbreak made healthcare systems across the globe to be in the edge of the battle.

We aimed to quantitatively assess the global change in surgical and oncological clinical practice in the early COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, we designed a 12-item online survey on the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in urology. Demographic survey data, change of clinical practice, current performance of procedures, and current commencement of treatment for 5 conditions in medical urological oncology were evaluated. RESULTS: 235 urologists from 44 countries responded. Out of them, 93% indicated a change of clinical practice due to COVID-19. In a 4-tiered surgery down-escalation scheme, 44% reported to make first cancellations, 23% secondary cancellations, 20% last cancellations and 13% emergency cases only. Oncological surgeries had low cancellation rates (%): transurethral resection of bladder tumor (27%), radical cystectomy (21-24%), nephroureterectomy (21%), radical nephrectomy (18%), and radical orchiectomy (8%). (Neo)adjuvant/palliative treatment is currently not started by more than half of the urologists.

Using a practice-theoretical approach, we conducted a qualitative empirical study to explore how commuters organise the transition between their personal life and job. Through our analysis, we were able to identify different meanings of commuting and its strong interconnection with other everyday practices. This allowed us to gain deep insight into the social (non-)sustainability of commuting. At the core of our results are four different types of commuting practice whose impact on social sustainability differs widely. Furthermore, since the interviews were conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, respondents had their first experience of strongly reduced commuting.

We searched Medline Ovid, Embase and Scopus for publications concerning ethical issues of research use of EHRs. We employed the constant comparative method to retrieve common ethical themes. We descriptively summarized empirical studies. The study reveals the breadth, depth, and complexity of ethical problems associated with research use of EHRs. The central ethical question that emerges from the review is how to manage access to EHRs. Managing accessibility consists of interconnected and overlapping issues: streamlining research access to EHRs, minimizing risk, engaging and educating patients, as well as ensuring trustworthy governance of EHR data.

Methods: 81 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled and followed until discharge. CT scores were quantified on a basis of a CT scoring system where each lung was divided into 3 zones: upper (above the carina), middle, and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement on a scale of 0-4 (0, 0%; 1, 0-24%; 2, 25% - 49%; 3, 50% -74%; 4, >74%).Temporal trends of CT scores and the laboratory parameters characteristic of COVID-19 were analyzed. Correlations between the two were determined at three milestones (initial presentation, worst CT manifestation, and recovery finding before discharge). Their correlations with duration to worst CT manifestation and discharge from symptom onset were evaluated. Results: CT scores peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5), and stayed steady. C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase increased, peaked on illness days 6-8 and 8-11 (mean: 23.5 mg/L, 259.9 U/L), and gradually declined. Continual decrease and increase were observed in hemoglobin and lymphocyte count, respectively. Albumin reduced and remained at low levels with a nadir on illness days 12-15 (36.6 g/L). Both initial (r = 0.58, 0.64, p < 0.05) and worst CT scores (r = 0.47, 0.65, p < 0.05) were correlated with C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase; and CT scores before discharge, only with albumin (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Duration to worst CT manifestation was associated with initial and worst CT scores (r = 0.33, 0.29, p < 0.05). No parameters were related to timespan to discharge.

This study aims to compare the effect of combining nebulized amikacin with intravenous amikacin to the effect of the usual intravenous route alone in the treatment of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and its impact on the duration of mechanical ventilation, laboratory, and clinical picture of the patients. RESULTS: This study was carried out on 64 mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative VAP. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A included 32 patients treated with nebulized amikacin plus IV amikacin, and group B included 32 patients treated with IV amikacin alone. The duration of treatment for both groups was 8 days with a daily assessment of Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) and monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters. Sputum cultures were obtained thereafter. In our study, the CPIS score and overall ICU mortality were less in the nebulized than in the IV group but the difference failed to be statistically significant. Increase of oxygenation level (Pao2/Fio2 ratio), organism clearance, decrease in serum creatinine level, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay were significantly different in favor of group A than group B. CONCLUSION: Nebulized and IV amikacin offered better oxygenation, organism clearance, less nephrotoxicity, and less duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay than the IV group. Combined and IV routes were comparable regarding the decrease in CPIS score and ICU mortality with no significant difference between them. However, we prefer to use the combined regimen for the mentioned reasons.

To decrease in-person contact many medical schools have adapted their curricula by reducing or eliminating gross dissection. The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), believing gross dissection to be a critical foundational curricular component, retained cadaveric dissection in 2020 but in a reduced capacity (i.e., fewer labs and fewer student per lab). In an effort to address this shortfall in dissection experience and to increase student preparedness, 24 pre-lab demonstration videos covering 26 individual dissections were prepared for the 2020 cohort. Research Aim To determine if individual student performance is correlated with viewing pre-lab videos. Methods Pre-lab videos were available to all first-year students at IUSM (n=378 students across 9 campuses). Viewership data (total views, total duration) were aggregated from the Kaltura online video platform. Student exam performance data (practical and written exams) were compared to viewership data using the Pearson correlation test. Results 91.5% of student course evaluation respondents (n=329) report that they viewed pre-lab videos. Pearson's correlation tests revealed a positive correlation between viewership activity and overall performance on all exams. The strongest correlation (0.182) was between total views and overall practical exam performance. Correlation coefficients for individual block exams vary and range between 0.13 (back, upper limb and thorax) and 0.253 (Head and Neck). Likewise, correlation coefficients varied across campuses with several campuses exceeding the statewide values. Conclusion Pre-lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab-based learning from the lab environment when access and dissection time are limited. Their most immediate and significant impact is on practical exam performance although positive correlations between viewership data and performance on written exams with NBME-style questions suggests pre-lab videos effectively reinforce foundational anatomical relationships and concepts. While not directly addressing questions of overall cohort performance, particularly when dissection access is not limited, future directions for this research will include direct comparisons of overall class performance in multiple cohorts with and without full dissection schedule and with or without the aid of pre-lab videos. Likewise, student evaluation comments suggest that pre-lab videos were used in a variety of contexts (i.e., lab prep, peer-teaching, general study). An online survey exploring how students use the pre-lab videos was sent to the 2020 cohort at course end to better understand how students are using them. Implications Medical educators are increasingly asked to teach more with fewer contact hours. COVID-19 has exacerbated this situation. This study provides new data suggesting that pre-lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab-based learning when lab contact time is decreased.","output":"Viewing pre-lab gross anatomy demonstration videos correlates positively with student performance when total dissection time is limited by Covid-19 restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early March 2020, libraries across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began to close in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis On March 19, staff members in the Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Department at Penn State University Libraries pivoted to providing remote services to Penn State users and library partners from around the world In addition to describing the difficulties of transitioning to and the realities of working from home, this piece describes the challenges experienced in returning to the library Considerations for the future are also discussed","output":"Lessons Learned in Leaving the Library and Coming Back Again"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Just like Internet shopping, TV shopping as an emerging powerful channel of distribution has shown substantial growth in sales and in the number of customers over the past decade.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential for HCWs to recognize which procedures are potentially aerosolizing so that appropriate infection prevention precautions can be taken. The aim of this literature review was to identify potential AGMPs in Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and provide evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane Review databases up to April 3, 2020. All titles and abstracts of retrieved studies were evaluated and all studies mentioning potential AGMPs were included for formal review. Full text of included studies were assessed by two reviewers and the quality of the studies was evaluated. Ten categories of potential AGMPs were developed and recommendations were provided for each category. RESULTS: Direct evidence indicates that CO2 laser ablation, the use of high-speed rotating devices, electrocautery and endotracheal suctioning are AGMPs. Indirect evidence indicates that tracheostomy should be considered as potential AGMPs. Nasal endoscopy and nasal packing/epistaxis management can result in droplet transmission, but it is unknown if these procedures also carry the risk of airborne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, special care should be taken when CO2 lasers, electrocautery and high-speed rotating devices are used in potentially infected tissue.

Zoonoses are the commonest source of emerging human infections and inter-species transmission is facilitated by anthropogenic factors such as encroachment and destruction of wilderness areas, wildlife trafficking and climate change. South Africa was selected for a One Health study to identify research priorities for control of zoonoses due to its complex disease burden and an overstretched health system. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 18 experts identified priority zoonotic diseases, knowledge gaps and proposed research priorities for the next 5 y. Each priority was scored using predefined criteria by another group of five experts and then weighted by a reference group (n=28) and the 18 experts. RESULTS: Seventeen diseases were mentioned with the top five being rabies (14/18), TB (13/18), brucellosis (11/18), Rift Valley fever (9/11) and cysticercosis (6/18). In total, 97 specific research priorities were listed, with the majority on basic epidemiological research (n=57), such as measuring the burden of various zoonoses (n=24), followed by 20 on development of new interventions. The highest research priority score was for improving existing interventions (0.77/1.0), followed by health policy and systems research (0.72/1.0). CONCLUSION: Future zoonotic research should improve understanding of zoonotic burden and risk factors and new interventions in public health.

Although antibiotic use and travelers' diarrhea have shown to influence the ESBL-E acquisition risk, it remains largely unknown whether successful colonization of ESBL-E during travel is associated with the composition, functional capacity and resilience of the traveler's microbiome. The microbiome of pre- and post-travel fecal samples from 190 international travelers visiting Africa or Asia was profiled using whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. A metagenomics species concept approach was used to determine the microbial composition, population diversity and functional capacity before travel and how it is altered longitudinally. Eleven travelers were positive for ESBL-E before travel and removed from the analysis. Neither the microbial richness (Chao1), diversity (effective Shannon) and community structure (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) in pretravel samples nor the longitudinal change of these metrics during travel were predictive for ESBL-E acquisition. A zero-inflated two-step beta-regression model was used to determine how the longitudinal change in both prevalence and abundance of each taxon was related to ESBL acquisition. There were detected increases in both the prevalence and abundance of Citrobacter freundii and two members of the genus Bacteroides, in association with remaining uncolonized by ESBL-E. These results highlight the potential of these individual microbes as a microbial consortium to prevent the acquisition of ESBL-E.

A total of 833 records were identified, of which 14 met eligibility criteria (published in English since 1995, targeted youth health and/or youth with health issues, and communication was entirely digital or combined with in-person interaction). The results showed that the majority of health-focused e-mentoring studies were conducted with young people with existing health conditions rather than on the use of e-mentoring to promote overall health and wellness.

However, the statistical significance of this relationship breaks down as soon as potentially confounding factors, in particular, the local Catholic population share, are controlled for. Our findings do not provide valid support for a significant role of grandparental childcare in driving SARS-CoV-2 infections, but rather suggest that the frequency of extra-familial contacts driven by religious communities might be a more relevant channel in this context.

Vascular involvement leads to an array of complications ranging from thrombosis to pulmonary edema secondary to loss of barrier function. This review will address the vasculopathy of COVID-19 with a focus on the role of the endothelium in orchestrating the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The endothelial receptor systems and molecular pathways activated in the setting of COVID-19 and the consequences of these inflammatory and prothrombotic changes on endothelial cell function will be discussed. The sequelae of COVID-19 vascular involvement at the level of organ systems will also be addressed, with an emphasis on the pulmonary vasculature, but with consideration of effects on other vascular beds. The dramatic changes in endothelial phenotypes associated with COVID-19 has enabled the identification of biomarkers that could help guide therapy and predict outcomes. Knowledge of vascular pathogenesis in COVID-19 has also informed therapeutic approaches that may control its systemic sequelae. Since our understanding of vascular response in COVID-19 continues to evolve, we will consider areas of controversy, such as the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 directly infects endothelium and the degree to which vascular responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unique or common to those of other viruses capable of causing severe respiratory disease.

Establishing the prevalence estimates of sexual violence at higher education institutions (HEIs) is essential for designing and resourcing responses to sexual violence, including monitoring the effectiveness of prevention initiatives and institutional programmes. Yet, to date, there have been no rigorous studies assessing prevalence of sexual violence at HEIs in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Informed by guidance from Universities UK, the University of Oxford administration and the related student advocacy groups working within the University, Oxford Understanding Relationships, Sex, Power, Abuse and Consent Experiences is a cross-sectional survey of all undergraduate and graduate students over the age of 18 enrolled at the University of Oxford, UK. The survey design uses a complete sampling approach and measures adapted from previous campus climate surveys in the USA as well as the Sexual Experiences Survey (USA). The analysis will estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual violence perpetration and victimisation, and will examine whether ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation are associated with these primary outcomes.

Pregnant women are one such group of individuals who are at in increased risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their immunocompromised state. In South Africa, HIV infection and pre-eclampsia are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, with South Africa being the HIV epicentre of the world. The relationship between COVID-19 superimposed on HIV infection and preeclampsia is complex and uncertain due to their different immune responses, and therefore requires further research. RECENT FINDINGS: Notably evidence suggests that pregnant women with chronic comorbidities (HIV and pre-eclampsia) may be at a greater risk of contracting or encountering complications from COVID-19. Maternal stress, during a pandemic, as well as home delivery have become potential options for pregnant woman. Nonetheless there is currently a paucity of information on the combined effect of COVID-19 in HIV-associated preeclampsia.

Using Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (EdTx) as an adjuvant, we previously showed that innate responses triggered after sublingual immunization could limit generation of IgA responses. We tested whether co-administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI) could rescue the ability of EdTx to induce broad antibody responses, including mucosal IgA. NEI supplementation of sublingual vaccines containing EdTx promoted antigen-specific serum IgA responses but also enhanced serum IgG1, and IgG2b responses. This enhancing effect of NEI did not extend to all antibody isotypes and IgG sublclasses, since NEI reduced serum IgE responses and did not affect IgG2a/c and IgG3 responses. NEI supplementation also promoted anti-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) neutralizing antibodies and enhanced high affinity IgG1 and IgA antibodies. In addition to serum IgA, NEI supplementation stimulated antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in the GI tract, and enhanced antigen-specific IgG responses in vaginal washes. Analysis of CD4(+) T helper cell responses revealed that co-administration of NEI broadened the profile of cytokine responses, by stimulating Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tfh cytokines. We also noted that NEI had a higher stimulatory effect on IL-5, IL-10, IL-17 responses.","output":"A Novel Supplementation Approach to Enhance Host Response to Sublingual Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCovid-19 has significantly impacted the nations day-to-day life and inevitably affected the workplace too. The NHS has been under visible unprecedented stress and consequently staff have carried the burden. The general paediatricians at Birmingham Childrens Hospital wanted to understand how the medical staff felt they could be supported during this difficult timeObjectivesTo assess the wellbeing and team morale amongst medical staff within the General Paediatrics team at Birmingham Childrens Hospital (BCH) during the Covid-19 pandemic and implement a new method to improve wellbeing and team morale.MethodsA questionnaire was created and distributed to the medical staff working within the General Paediatrics team at BCH. Questions were formulated following research relating to existing staff wellbeing questionnaires and current literature regarding the effects of Covid-19 on mental health, wellbeing and team morale.ResultsTwenty-two staff members completed the questionnaire which represented their experience over the last month. Fifteen (68.2%) looked forward to going to work and nineteen reported feeling happy, smiling and laughing at work when asked. However, 27.3% only felt appreciated at work a few times a month or less and 31.7% stated that their good work was acknowledged less than a few times a month. Twelve felt that they needed someone to talk to at work and four felt unable to confide in a colleague at least a few times a month. 50% felt then needed some time alone during a break at work. 81.8% admitted that Covid-19 had affected their mental health or wellbeing, 50% felt socially isolated as a result of Covid-19 and 95.5% felt worried about their health of the health of family/friends as a result of Covid-19. Seventeen staff members felt that Covid-19 had affected team morale and eighteen felt that knowing their colleagues better would improve team morale and make them more likely to confide in them if needed.ConclusionsThis evaluation highlights that the majority of staff at BCH felt Covid-19 had affected their mental health, wellbeing and the General Paediatric team morale. It stressed the importance building colleague relationships to support each other during this worrisome time. A Lets Strike Up a Conversation matchbox activity was created in response to the findings to initiate non-covid and work-related conversation during work breaks. The matchbox had conversation starting Match cards within to stimulate and improve team communications and encourage staff to get to know each other. The effects of this intervention are to be evaluated in due course. The assessment of staff wellbeing and team morale has highlighted the importance of actively surveying the team during new and unexpected changes/circumstances. Early recognition facilitates early response and adjustments to boost team morale and wellbeing.","output":"Staff wellbeing and team morale during the Covid-19 pandemic at Birmingham childrens hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect many organs and may be responsible for numerous complications including cardiovascular problems. Methods: We analysed consecutive patients (n = 51) admitted to the cardiology department between 1st October 2020 and 31st January 2021 due to symptoms which might have reflected cardiovascular complications following COVID-19. We collected data concerning clinical characteristics, results of laboratory tests, echocardiography and 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording. Results: The post-COVID-19 complications appeared 1C4 months after disease recovery. Severe cardiovascular complications were observed in 27.5% of hospitalized patients. In comparison to those with mild complications, patients with severe complications had significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (36 vs. 8%;p = 0.01), decrease in ejection fraction (36% vs. 0%, p &lt; 0.001), higher resting heart rate at admission (85 vs. 72 bpm;p &lt; 0.001), and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.02) and troponin T (17.9 vs. 4.2 pg/ml;p = 0.01). Dyspnoea and exercise intolerance were also more frequent in patients with severe complications. Conclusions: Diabetes, elevated level of CRP and troponin, heart rate variability parameters and worsening of left ventricular ejection fraction are related to the severity of cardiovascular complications following COVID-19 infection.

Nevertheless, the challenge of developing thermostable vaccine adjuvants has sometimes not received appropriate emphasis. Adjuvants comprise an expansive range of particulate and molecular compositions, requiring innovative thermostable formulation and process development approaches. AREAS COVERED Reports on efforts to develop thermostable adjuvant-containing vaccines have increased in recent years, and substantial progress has been made in enhancing stability of the major classes of adjuvants. This narrative review summarizes the current status of thermostable vaccine adjuvant development and looks forward to the next potential developments in the field. EXPERT OPINION As adjuvant-containing vaccines become more widely used, the unique challenges associated with developing thermostable adjuvant formulations merit increased attention. In particular, more focused efforts are needed to translate promising proof-of-concept technologies and formulations into clinical products.","output":"Development of thermostable vaccine adjuvants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, an outbreak of fatal infection caused by a pantropic variant (strain CB/05) of canine coronavirus (CCoV) has been reported. In this study, evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric CCoV is not fully protective against strain CB/05. Twenty-two, 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric CCoV were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight (groups A and B) and one control group of six (group C) dogs. Dogs in groups A and B were inoculated oronasally with different doses (4  10(5) or 4  10(3) TCID(50)) of the pantropic strain CB/05, whereas dogs in group C were used as negative controls. Clinical, post-mortem and virological investigations showed that, despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric CCoV, dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain CB/05. This was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs, mainly vomiting and diarrhoea. Involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia (below 70% of the initial counts), gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of CB/05 RNA in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs. The presence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered. The present study demonstrates that strain CB/05 is able to induce infection and disease in dogs seropositive to enteric CCoV, thus highlighting the need for extensive epidemiological investigation and for the possible development of novel antigenically relevant vaccines.","output":"Immunity after natural exposure to enteric canine coronavirus does not provide complete protection against infection with the new pantropic CB/05 strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our recommendation, as experts who have monitored health hazards at the Hajj for over 15 years, especially if the situation with COVID-19 continues to escalate globally is that Hajj 2020 will be at risk of being suspended and a means for Muslims to fulfill their rights in the future either personally or even by proxy need to be announced.

Our objective was to review tracings, which also included muscular activity, obtained in sedated patients who were mechanically ventilated to describe the entrainment events and their characteristics. The term reverse triggering was adopted to describe the ventilator-triggered muscular efforts. METHODS Over a 3-month period, recordings containing fl ow, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure or electrical activity of the diaphragm were reviewed. Recordings were obtained from a series of consecutive heavily sedated patients ventilated with an assist-control mode of ventilation for ARDS. The duration of entrainment, the entrainment ratio, and the phase difference elapsing between the commencement of the ventilator and neural breaths were evaluated. RESULTS The tracings of eight consecutive patients with ARDS were reviewed; they all showed different forms of entrainment. Reverse triggering occurred over a portion varying from 12% to 100% of the total recording period. Seven patients had a 1:1 mechanical insuffl ation to diaphragmatic contractions ratio; this coexisted with a 1:2 ratio in one patient and 1:2 and 1:3 ratios in another. One patient exhibited only a 1:2 ratio. The frequency of reverse-triggered breaths had a mean coeffi cient of variability of , 5%, very close to the variability of mechanical breaths. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the fi rst time that the presence of respiratory entrainment in sedated, critically ill adult patients who are mechanically ventilated has been documented. The reverse-triggered breaths illustrate a new form of neuromechanical coupling with potentially important clinical consequences.","output":"Mechanical ventilation-induced reverse-triggered breaths: a frequently unrecognized form of neuromechanical coupling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Some patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) present with abdominal symptoms. Abdominal manifestations of COVID on imaging are not yet established. The goal of this study was to quantify the frequency of positive findings on abdominopelvic CT in COVID-positive patients, and to identify clinical factors associated with positive findings to assist with imaging triage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included adult COVID-positive patients with abdominopelvic CT performed within 14 days of their COVID PCR nasal swab assay from 3/1/2020 to 5/1/2020. Clinical CT reports were reviewed for the provided indication and any positive abdominopelvic findings. Demographic and laboratory data closest to the CT date were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression model with binary outcome of having no reported positive abdominopelvic findings was constructed. RESULTS: Of 141 COVID-positive patients having abdominopelvic CT (average age 64 years [ 16], 91 [64%] women), 80 (57%) had positive abdominopelvic findings. Abdominal pain was the most common indication, provided in 54% (43/80) and 74% (45/61) of patients with and without reported positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.015). 70% (98/141) of patients overall had reported findings in the lung bases. Findings either typical or intermediate for COVID were reported in 50% (40/80) and 64% (39/61) of patients with and without positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.099). Of 80 patients with positive abdominopelvic findings, 25 (31%) had an abnormality of gastrointestinal tract, and 14 (18%) had solid organ infarctions or vascular thromboses. In multivariate analysis, age (OR 0.85, p = 0.023), hemoglobin (OR 0.83, p = 0.029) and male gender (OR 2.58, p = 0.032) were independent predictors of positive abdominopelvic findings, adjusted for race and Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSION: Abdominopelvic CT performed on COVID-positive patients yielded a positive finding in 57% of patients. Younger age, male gender, and lower hemoglobin were associated with higher odds of having reportable positive abdominopelvic CT findings.","output":"Abdominopelvic CT findings in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular mechanisms that drive the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus C the causative agent of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic C are under intense current scrutiny, to understand how the virus operates and to uncover ways in which the disease can be prevented or alleviated.

Challenges of acute perioperative pain management or intensive care management of patients receiving opioid agonist treatment include opioid tolerance and ongoing prescribing of methadone or buprenorphine. There has been some ambiguity about the optimal perioperative management of buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu receptor.In this article, a framework to identify emerging opioid misuse problems, identify risk of overdose and to manage the opioid-dependent patient on opioid agonist treatment perioperatively or in the intensive care unit is provided. Diagnostic criteria and risk stratification criteria are presented. Management strategies include trauma-informed care, care planning and care coordination with community practitioners and opioid agonist treatment providers. Continuing methadone or buprenorphine perioperatively with additional opioid and non-opioid analgesia is generally recommended. Increased opioid agonist treatment doses may be required on discharge.

METHODS: 1. Tblastx searches of SARS-CoV-2 are performed by limiting searches to five Plasmodium species that infect humans. 2. Aligned sequences in the respective organisms proteomes are searched with blastp. 3. Binding predictions of the identified SARS-CoV-2 peptide to HLA supertype representatives are performed. 4. Blastp searches of predicted epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA allele are performed by limiting searches to H. sapiens and Plasmodium species, separately. 5. Peptides with minimum 60% identity to the predicted epitopes are found in results. 6. Peptides among those, which bind strongly to the same HLA allele, are predicted. 7. Step-4 is repeated by limiting searches to H. sapiens, followed by the remaining steps until step-7, for peptides sourced by Plasmodium species after step-6. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 peptide with single letter amino acid code CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC has the highest identity to P. vivax. Its YFCTCYFGLF part is predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A*24:02. Peptides in the human proteome both homologous to YFCTCYFGLF and with a strong binding affinity to HLA-A*24:02 are YYCARRFGLF, YYCHCPFGVF, and YYCQQYFFLF.

In the work reported here, we detected that homoharringtonine (HHT) presents effective antiviral activity. HHT completely inhibited infections of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at concentrations of 50, 100, and 500 nM in cell cultures, respectively. Treatment with HHT at doses of 0.05 or 0.2 mg/kg significantly reduced viral load and relieved severe symptoms in PEDV- or NDV-infected animals. HHT treatment, however, moderately inhibited avian influenza virus (AIV) infection, suggesting its potent antiviral action is restricted to a number of classes of RNA viruses. In this study, we also observed that HHT actively inhibited herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 139 nM; the treatment with HHT at 1000 nM led to reductions of three orders of magnitude. Moreover, HHT antagonized the phosphorylation level of endogenous and exogenous eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E), which might regulate the selective translation of specific messenger RNA (mRNA).

We have previously shown that in cells infected with gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were drastically upregulated, and the MAP kinase p38 and the integrated stress response pathways were implicated in this process. In this study, we report that coronavirus infection activates a negative regulatory loop that restricts the upregulation of a number of proinflammatory genes. As revealed by the initial transcriptomic and subsequent validation analyses, the anti-inflammatory adenine-uridine (AU)-rich element (ARE)-binding protein, Zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) and its related family members were upregulated in cells infected with IBV and three other coronaviruses, alphacoronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43, respectively. Characterization of the functional roles of ZFP36 during IBV infection demonstrated that ZFP36 promoted the degradation of transcripts coding for IL-6, IL-8, dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and TNF--induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), through binding to AREs in these transcripts. Consistently, knockdown and inhibition of JNK and p38 kinase activities reduced the expression of ZFP36, as well as the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. On the contrary, overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2), the upstream and downstream kinases of p38, respectively, increased the expression of ZFP36 and decreased the expression of IL-8. Taken together, this study reveals an important regulatory role of the MKK3-p38-MK2-ZFP36 axis in coronavirus infection-induced proinflammatory response. Importance Excessive and uncontrolled induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the so-called cytokine release syndrome (CRS), would cause life-threatening complications and multiple organ failure in severe coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19. This study reveals that coronavirus infection also induces the expression of ZFP36, an anti-inflammatory ARE-binding protein, promoting the degradation of ARE-containing transcripts coding for IL-6 and IL-8 as well as a number of other proteins related to inflammatory response. Furthermore, the p38 MAP kinase, its upstream kinase MKK3 and downstream kinase MK2 were shown to play a regulatory role in upregulation of ZFP36 during coronavirus infection cycles. This MKK3-p38-MK2-ZFP36 axis would constitute a potential therapeutic target for severe coronavirus infections.","output":"Activation of the MKK3-p38-MK2-ZFP36 axis by coronavirus infection restricts the upregulation of AU-rich element-containing transcripts in proinflammatory response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zhang et al. showed that COVID\\\\19 affected patients present liver biochemistry abnormalities, including elevation of aminotransferases, gamma\\\\glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase (1).

The detailed characterization of the protein primary structure by mass spectrometry (MS) is mandatory, as described in ICHQ6B guidelines. In this work, several recombinant RBD proteins produced in five expression systems were characterized using a non-conventional protocol known as in-solution buffer-free digestion (BFD). In a single ESICMS spectrum, BFD allowed very high sequence coverage ( 99%) and the detection of highly hydrophilic regions, including very short and hydrophilic peptides (2C8 amino acids), and the His(6)-tagged C-terminal peptide carrying several post-translational modifications at Cys(538) such as cysteinylation, homocysteinylation, glutathionylation, truncated glutathionylation, and cyanylation, among others. The analysis using the conventional digestion protocol allowed lower sequence coverage (80C90%) and did not detect peptides carrying most of the above-mentioned PTMs. The two C-terminal peptides of a dimer [RBD((319C541))-(His)(6)](2) linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys(538)-Cys(538)) with twelve histidine residues were only detected by BFD. This protocol allows the detection of the four disulfide bonds present in the native RBD, low-abundance scrambling variants, free cysteine residues, O-glycoforms, and incomplete processing of the N-terminal end, if present. Artifacts generated by the in-solution BFD protocol were also characterized. BFD can be easily implemented; it has been applied to the characterization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of two RBD-based vaccines, and we foresee that it can be also helpful to the characterization of mutated RBDs.

In this report, we describe the Video Visits for Elders Project (VVEP), a quality improvement effort to help older adults access video visits at an academic primary care practice. Methods We reached out to empaneled older adults ( 65 years) who had a scheduled visit between March 30 and June 12, 2020. We assessed patients readiness to engage in a virtual visit and offered to walk them through accessing the platform if they owned a compatible device. We evaluated outcomes of those phone calls and actual visit completion. Results Between March 26 and June 3, 2020, we called 1,427 patients, reaching 1,025 (72%). Of those reached (mean age 75.6 years), 312 (30%) were already video-enabled, 192 (19%) asked for technical assistance, 185 (18%) did not have access to an electronic device, and 336 (33%) declined assistance. Of those reached, 40% completed their visit by video, 27% by telephone, and 1% by in-person visit, while 30% canceled and 2% no-showed. Conclusions VVEP successfully innovated to promote equitable access to telemedicine for vulnerable older patients in a time of crisis. Almost half required technical assistance or did not have access to a compatible device to engage in virtual care. As telemedicine will continue to play an important role in access to clinical care even in a post-pandemic world, it is imperative for health systems to focus on technological need to promote equitable access to care for all patients.","output":"Increasing Telehealth Access to Care for Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic at an Academic Medical Center: Video Visits for Elders Project (VVEP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enteroviruses are among the most common human viral pathogens. Infection with members of a subgroup of viruses within this genus, the nonpoliovirus enteroviruses (NPEVs), can result in a broad spectrum of serious illnesses, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like childhood paralysis; neonatal sepsis; aseptic meningitis; myocarditis; and hand-foot-mouth disease. Despite the diverse primary sites of virus infection, including the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and an array of diseases associated with these infections, there is significant genetic and antigenic similarity among NPEVs. This conservation results in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies that are either able to bind and neutralize or bind but not neutralize multiple NPEVs. Using plaque reduction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based binding assays, we define the antigenic relationship among poliovirus and NPEVs, including multiple isolates of EV-D68, EV-A71, EV-D70, EV-94, EV-111, Coxsackievirus A24v, and rhinovirus.

This international longitudinal study compared young childrens physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Parents of children aged 3-5 years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in physical activity, sedentary behaviour (screen-time) and sleep and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12 months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). PA, sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent questionnaire. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Results: : 948 parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (AdjOR=2.0, 95%CI 1.0 to 3.8) and SST (2.2, CI 1.2 to 3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO recommendations (AdjOR 3.3, CI 1.1 to 9.8) than those who were not. Children of caregivers with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (0.5, CI 0.3 to 0.9). Conclusion: PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs.

The theoretical framework was tested using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling method. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from branded functional beverage consumers aged 18 and up. For the final data analysis, 445 usable questionnaires were utilized. This study revealed that perceived behavioral control and subjective norms were significant predictors of BFB purchase intention and subsequent consumption behavior in the post-pandemic period. The perceived threat of NCDs did not affect purchase intention or consumption behavior. Perceived susceptibility indirectly affected BFB purchase intention and consumption behavior via subjective norms (role of subjective norms as a mediator). The study implied that to positively influence the subjective norms of potential BFB customers, food marketers should focus on opinion leaders and subject experts. The companies may devise appropriate options for delivering functional beverage products to consumers doors via m-commerce and e-commerce platforms at competitive prices. They may also focus on customer education centered on the superior quality of their functional product portfolio and the ways of acquiring those at the minimum cost during this post-pandemic period. This pioneering study investigated the use of TPB and HBM in the context of post-pandemic functional beverage consumption. To build healthier and more robust food systems, governments and public health authorities across the world should proactively design and execute policies to promote sustained and strategic changes through functional foods and beverages.

Under this special background of COVID-19 pandemic, this review focuses on the latest rapid microfluidic PCR. Rapid PCR is concluded in two main features, including the reactor (type, size, material) and the implementation of thermal cycling. Especially, the compromise between speed and sensitivity with microfluidic PCR is explored based on the system ratio of (thermal cycling time)/(reactor size).

While much research has been dedicated to understanding the genetic causes of the disease, our understanding of the mechanistic impacts of GRN deficiency has only recently begun to take shape. With no known cure or treatment available for GRN-related FTD, there is a growing need to rapidly advance genetic and/or small-molecule therapeutics for this disease. This issue is complicated by the fact that, while lysosomal dysfunction seems to be a key driver of pathology, the mechanisms linking a loss of GRN to a pathogenic state remain unclear. In our attempt to address these key issues, we have turned to the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to model, study, and find potential therapies for GRN-deficient FTD. First, we show that the loss of the nematode GRN ortholog, pgrn-1, results in several behavioral and molecular defects, including lysosomal dysfunction and defects in autophagic flux. Our investigations implicate the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in the regulation of many of the in vivo defects associated with pgrn-1 loss. Finally, we utilized these nematodes as an in vivo tool for high-throughput drug screening and identified two small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against GRN/pgrn-1 deficiency.

Extracted results were summarised using quantitative and qualitative descriptive analysis. RESULTS Of the 18 studies (100%) that met the inclusion criteria, most were observational studies (60%) that evaluated findings quantitatively (60%). HCX were often concerned with patient information, global satisfaction as well as relationships and communication between patients and providers and generally covered ambulatory care, hospital care and rehabilitation services. Overall, the considerable heterogeneity of the included studies' outcomes only permitted relatively trivial levels of synthesis. CONCLUSION In Germany, research on HCX of patients with CHF is characterised by missing, inadequate and insufficient information. Future research would benefit from qualitative analyses, evidence syntheses, longitudinal analyses that investigate HCX throughout the disease trajectory, and better reporting of sociodemographic data.

The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

Our analysis contributes a better understanding of the constitutive nature of the duty to care, defined in part by taking account of public views. This broadened understanding can further inform the articulation of acceptable norms of duty to care and policy development efforts. What is more, it illustrates the urgent need for policy-makers and regulators to get clarity on obligations, responsibilities, and accountability in the execution of HCPs' duty to care during times of universal vulnerability.","output":"The duty to care in an influenza pandemic: A qualitative study of Canadian public perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently there are no reported series determining the Covid-19 infected lung cancer patients characteristics and outcome that allow us to clarify strategies to protect our patients. In our study we determine whether exists differences in cumulative incidence and severity of Covid-19 infection between lung cancer patients visiting our Medical Oncology department and the reference population of our center (320,000 people), in the current epicenter of the pandemic in Europe (Madrid, Spain). We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9 %) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3 %) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p < 0.0001). Dead lung cancer patients were elderly compared to survivors: 72 versus 64.5 years old (p = 0.12). Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improves the outcome of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients, detecting only 1/6 deaths between patients under this treatment versus others treatment, with statistical significance in the univariate and multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.04, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients have a higher mortality rate than general population. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment seems like a good treatment option. It is important to try to minimize visits to hospitals (without removing their active treatments) in order to decrease nosocomial transmission.","output":"Covid-19 and lung cancer: A greater fatality rate?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: El incremento exponencial de casos confirmados con el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 oblig a las autoridades de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud a declarar como pandemia esta emergencia sanitaria Objetivo: Caracterizar a ni?os y adultos confirmados con la COVID-19 desde los puntos de vista clnico y epidemiolgico Mtodos: Se realiz un estudio observacional, descriptivo y transversal de 74 pacientes confirmados con la COVID-19, quienes estuvieron ingresados en el Hospital Clinicoquirrgico Docente Dr Joaqun Castillo Duany de Santiago de Cuba, desde marzo hasta mayo de 2020 Los datos se obtuvieron de las historias clnicas de los afectados Entre las variables analizadas figuraron: edad, sexo, letalidad, estado al egreso, lugar de procedencia de los casos e inicio de sntomas de la COVID-19 antes del ingreso hospitalario Resultados: Se hall un predominio del sexo masculino (52,7 %) Hubo una tendencia al ingreso hospitalario de pacientes asintomticos confirmados, de ellos 50,0 % del grupo de 1 a 17 a?os de edad;94,5 % de los afectados egresaron vivos de la institucin Ningn ni?o fue notificado como grave o crtico La tos (60,0 %), la fiebre (34,5 %) y la falta de aire (21,8 %) fueron las manifestaciones clnicas ms referidas Conclusiones: Con un enfoque biosocial se informa una primera experiencia en la atencin a pacientes confirmados con la COVID-19 en Santiago de Cuba El diagnstico clnico y epidemiolgico favoreci a registrar la mayor incidencia de esta enfermedad en adultos jvenes sintomticos e identificar otros pacientes que transmitieron el virus sin manifestar sntomas ABSTRACT Introduction: The exponential increment of confirmed cases with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 forced the authorities of the Health World Organization to declare as pandemic this health emergency Objective: to characterize children and adults confirmed with the COVID-19 from the clinical and epidemiological points of view Methods: An observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study of 74 patients confirmed with the COVID-19 who were admitted to Dr Joaqun Castillo Duany Teaching Clinical Surgical Hospital was carried out in Santiago de Cuba, from March to May, 2020 The data were obtained from the medical records of the affected patients Among the analyzed variables we have: age, sex, lethality, discharge state, place of origin of the cases and beginning of COVID-19 symptoms before admission to hospital Results: A prevalence of the male sex (52 7 %) was found There was a tendency to the hospital admission of confirmed asymptomatic patients, of them 50 0 % of the 1 to 17 age group;94 5 % of the affected patients were alive when discharged of the institution No kids were notified in serious or critical condition Cough (60 0 %), fever (34 5 %) and breathlessness (21 8 %) were the most referred clinical features Conclusions: With a biosocial approach a first experience is informed in the care to confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Santiago de Cuba The clinical and epidemiological diagnosis favored to register the highest incidence in this disease in symptomatic young adults and to identify other patients that transmitted the virus without manifesting symptoms","output":"Clinical and epidemiological characterization of patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Santiago de Cuba"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated frequency of reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and serum antibody response following infection over 8 years in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation cohort. METHODS: Households were followed annually for identification of acute respiratory illness with RT-PCR confirmed HCoV infection. Serum collected before and at two time points post infection were tested using a multiplex binding assay to quantify antibody to seasonal, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SARS-CoV-2 spike sub-domains and N protein. RESULTS: Of 3418 participants, 40% were followed for 3years. A total of 1004 HCoV infections were documented; 303 (30%) were reinfections of any HCoV type. The number of HCoV infections ranged from 1 to 13 per individual. The mean time to reinfection with the same type was estimated at 983 days for 229E, 578 days for HKU1, 615 days for OC43, and 711 days for NL63. Binding antibody levels to seasonal HCoVs were high, with little increase post-infection, and were maintained over time. Homologous, pre-infection antibody levels did not significantly correlate with odds of infection, and there was little cross response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

On the other hand, higher sedentary time during the pandemic period can have deleterious effects. The objective of this study was to compare physical activity levels, sedentary time, and sleep parameters during the pre-COVID period and the COVID-19 pandemic period in young badminton athletes. METHODS: Fifteen young badminton athletes were evaluated during a pre-COVID period (July 2019) and during the COVID-19 period (July 2020). Sleep parameters, physical activity level, and sedentary time were measured using a tri-axial accelerometer. Participants wore the accelerometer on their dominant wrist for 7 days consecutively. In addition, the average of each sleep parameter [time in bed and total sleep time in hours per day, sleep efficiency (%), wake after sleep onset (WASO, total per day), and sleep latency (minutes per day)] was reported over the 7-day period. RESULTS: Athletes presented increased sedentary time (pre-COVID = 7.0  1.1 vs.COVID-19 = 8.9  1.9 h/day, p = 0.004, d = 1.30) and significant decreases in the total PA observed in counts per day (pre-COVID = 2,967,064.4  671,544.1 vs. COVID-19 = 1,868,210.2  449,768.4 counts/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.99), time in vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 7.7  0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.1  1.2 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.56), and time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (pre-COVID = 8.1  0.9 vs. COVID-19 = 6.5  1.3 h/day, p = 0.001, d = 1.48).

Intense activities in megacities induce high levels of air pollutants in the atmosphere that harm human health, cause regional haze and acid deposition, damage crops, influence air quality in regions far from the megacity sources, and contribute to climate change. Since the Great London Smog and the first recognized episode of Los Angeles photochemical smog seventy years ago, substantial progress has been made in improving the scientific understanding of air pollution and in developing emissions reduction technologies. However, much remains to be understood about the complex processes of atmospheric oxidation mechanisms; the formation and evolution of secondary particles, especially those containing organic species; and the influence of emerging emissions sources and changing climate on air quality and health. While air quality has substantially improved in megacities in developed regions and some in the developing regions, many still suffer from severe air pollution. Strong regional and international collaboration in data collection and assessment will be beneficial in strengthening the capacity. This article provides an overview of the sources of emissions in megacities, atmospheric physicochemical processes, air quality trends and management in a few megacities, and the impacts on health and climate.

Presently, the virus infection is diagnosed primarily by a process called the real-time Reverse TranscriptaseCPolymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) based on its genetic prints. This whole procedure takes a substantial amount of time to identify and diagnose the patients infected by the virus. The proposed research uses a wavelet-based convolution neural network architectures to detect SARS-nCoV. CNN is pre-trained on the ImageNet and trained end-to-end using thoracic X-ray images. To execute Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT), the available mother wavelet functions from different families, namely Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Biorthogonal, Coiflet, and Discrete Meyer, were considered. Two-level decomposition via DWT is adopted to extract prominent features peripheral and subpleural ground-glass opacities, often in the lower lobes explicitly from thoracic X-ray images to suppress noise effect, further enhancing the signal to noise ratio. The proposed wavelet-based deep learning models of both, two-class instances (COVID vs. Normal) and four-class instances (COVID-19 vs. PNA bacterial vs. PNA viral vs. Normal) were validated from publicly available databases using k-Fold Cross Validation (k-Fold CV) technique. In addition to these X-ray images, images of recent COVID-19 patients were further used to examine the models practicality and real-time feasibility in combating the current pandemic situation. It was observed that the Symlet 7 approximation component with two-level manifested the highest test accuracy of 98.87%, followed by Biorthogonal 2.6 with an efficiency of 98.73%. While the test accuracy for Symlet 7 and Biorthogonal 2.6 is high, Haar and Daubechies with two levels have demonstrated excellent validation accuracy on unseen data. It was also observed that the precision, the recall rate, and the dice similarity coefficient for four-class instances were 98%, 98%, and 99%, respectively, using the proposed algorithm.","output":"Wavelet and deep learning-based detection of SARS-nCoV from thoracic X-ray images for rapid and efficient testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global health has been thrown into turmoil by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused devastating morbidity and unprecedented loss of life in almost all continents of the world.

It was hypothesized that the youthful population and a vastly primed immune system were protective, and many people may have been exposed without coming down with the severe disease. Most of them would have presented in hospitals with other medical conditions and possibly transmit COVID-19 to health workers inadvertently. This study is designed to measure serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in health workers as a marker of latent exposure. Asymptomatic frontline health workers were randomly selected from the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria; venous blood samples were obtained from them, and the serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG level was determined using ELISA techniques. A proportion of participants with seropositivity were obtained, and factors associated with seropositivity were determined. A total of 133 participants were recruited for this study, and 60 (45.1%) of them were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the seropositive participants were doctors, nurses, health assistants, laboratory scientists and technicians, and nonmedical staff. Obstetrics, gynecology, and emergency departments had higher odds of seropositivity. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is very high among frontline health workers, though asymptomatic.

METHODS: Searches were conducted in May 2020 in PubMed, medRxiv, arXiv, Scopus, WHO COVID-19 database, Compendex & Inspec. We included studies reporting data on any indoor setting except schools, any indoor activities and any potential means of transmission. Articles were screened by a single reviewer, with rejections assessed by a second reviewer. We used Joanna Briggs Institute and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools for evaluating epidemiological studies and developed bespoke tools for the evaluation of study types not covered by these instruments. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by a single reviewer. We conducted a meta-analysis of secondary attack rates in household transmission. Otherwise, data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: We identified 1573 unique articles. After screening and quality assessment, fifty-eight articles were retained for analysis. Experimental evidence from fluid mechanics and microbiological studies demonstrates that aerosolised transmission is theoretically possible; however, we found no conclusive epidemiological evidence of this occurring. The evidence suggests that ventilation systems have the potential to decrease virus transmission near the source through dilution but to increase transmission further away from the source through dispersal. We found no evidence for faecal-oral transmission. Laboratory studies suggest that the virus survives for longer on smooth surfaces and at lower temperatures. Environmental sampling studies have recovered small amounts of viral RNA from a wide range of frequently touched objects and surfaces; however, epidemiological studies are inconclusive on the extent of fomite transmission. We found many examples of transmission in settings characterised by close and prolonged indoor contact. We estimate a pooled secondary attack rate within households of 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9, 13). There were insufficient data to evaluate the transmission risks associated with specific activities. Workplace challenges related to poverty warrant further investigation as potential risk factors for workplace transmission. Fluid mechanics evidence on the physical properties of droplets generated by coughing, speaking and breathing reinforce the importance of maintaining 2 m social distance to reduce droplet transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a snap-shot of evidence on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments from the early months of the pandemic. The overall quality of the evidence was low. As the quality and quantity of available evidence grows, it will be possible to reach firmer conclusions on the risk factors for and mechanisms of indoor transmission.","output":"Which factors influence the extent of indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2?

This objective is becoming more attainable through the co-evolution of gene transfer vectors and regulation systems. The ideal vector should efficiently transduce non-dividing cells with minimal toxicity, thus endowing the system with persistent transgene expression. The helper-dependent adenovirus vectors meet these requirements, as demonstrated in various studies in the literature. The most promising regulation system is the tet-on system, which has low basal transcriptional activity and high inducibility. To explore the regulated transgene expression in the context of a helper-dependent vector, we constructed the HD-TET-IFN vector, containing the mIFN gene under the control of the tetracycline inducible transactivator rtTA2(s)-S2. Mice injected with HD-TET-IFN showed high levels of serum mIFN only upon transcriptional activation. The transgene expression was reinducible to the same high level up to 3 months p.i., and the amount of expressed cytokine could be regulated by dosing doxycycline. Transcriptional activation of mIFN induced by doxycycline resulted in prolonged survival and reduced liver damage in HD-TET-IFN-injected mice challenged with a lethal dose of coronavirus. Activation of antiviral genes mediated by doxycycline-dependent mIFN expression was also observed at low HD-TET-IFN doses. The possibility of controlling gene expression by the combination of HD vectors and the latest tet-on transactivator also holds promise for studying gene function in other animal models.","output":"Regulated and prolonged expression of mIFN in immunocompetent mice mediated by a helper-dependent adenovirus vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Despite the surge of publications examining the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in China, little was reported about effective solutions.

The data collected in this study describe a first attempt to introduce the qualitative and quantitative analyses of adulterants present in street drugs in Cartagena de Indias to improve surveillance. Through gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the purity and adulterants were quantified in 45 personal doses of cocaine powder and coca paste. 100% of the personal doses in the city were adulterated; caffeine, phenacetin, and levamisole were the main adulterants identified in cocaine. Besides the above, lidocaine was also found in coca paste. The purity of cocaine varied from 8% to almost 70%, with caffeine ranging from 6% to 42%. In the case of coca paste, the maximum content of cocaine found was 60%, while some samples contained as little as 14%.

Others have responded with acts of overaccommodative care that have minimized older adults autonomy. Taken together, there have been inferences of increased hostile and benevolent ageism. Currently, these claims lack empirical data, and the goal of this study was to examine if attitudes and experiences of ageism are on the rise. Across two studies, we examined young adults (N=268) attitudes of older adults and older adults (N=65) experiences of ageism before and after the start of the pandemic. In study 1, we examined ageist attitudes at 3 time points (2017, 2019, 2020) from separate, but equitable, college samples and found that hostile ageism was higher during the pandemic (F(2,265)=5.48, p<.001) and benevolent ageism demonstrated no differences.

Our findings suggest an increase in hostile ageist views, but a decrease in experiences, partially supporting the alleged claims of rising ageism.

In Germany, a study based on nationwide hospital discharge data of almost all German hospitals found a sepsis incidence of 158 per 100,000 inhabitants. Estimates based on clinical patient data from other industrialized countries were 780/100,000 (Sweden) and 517/100,000 (USA). However, the comparability of incidence rates is limited due to the different data sources and sepsis case identification strategies used. In all, 41.7% of sepsis patients died in hospital, and 17.9% of intensive care unit patients are affected by sepsis. Case identification of sepsis in health claims data has a low sensitivity; therefore, it is likely that sepsis incidence is underestimated using these data, as many sepsis cases are not coded as such.

Evidence suggests that estrogen-signaling pathways are closely linked to cancer development and progression. The novel G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER or GPR30) has been shown to influence cancer predisposition and progression, although results of related studies remain equivocal. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to estimate the relationship between GPER gene polymorphisms and GPER expression levels, with cancer predisposition and progression. The pooled results showed that two GPER polymorphisms, rs3808350 and rs3808351, were significantly associated with cancer predisposition, especially in the Asian population, but no significant association was detected for rs11544331. In parallel, we also found that cancer aggressiveness and progression correlated with rs3808351 and GPER expression in cancerous tissues. Altogether, our findings suggest that GPER plays a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis and progression. We suggest that rs3808350 and rs3808351 may be used as a prospective biomarker for cancer screening; while rs3808351 and GPER expression can be used to examine the prognosis of patients with cancer.

At initial stage, the way out to curb the deadly virus was lockdown, isolating the symptomatic people, quarantining travellers and educating the people about the coronavirus infection so that precautionary measures are followed by people. The present research focuses on the application of Geographic Information System on mapping the coronavirus cases in Jammu and Kashmir. The research attributes the role of dense population and urbanization responsible for increasing the coronavirus cases in the study area. The districts like Srinagar and Jammu with high population and urbanization (census 2011) attribute high number of corona cases in year 2020. This high population experiences the highest number of corona cases (Jammu 23,339, Srinagar 24,996), deaths (Jammu 350, Srinagar 444) and COVID-19 recoveries (Jammu 22,141, Srinagar 23,957). The highly urbanized and populated area are much exposed towards infection. The high number of corona case experiences heart-related issues. The number of heart-related deaths are increased to 29.6% during winter in study area by extreme weather conditions limiting regular exercising and outdoor activities. But, due to COVID-19 the amount of heart-related deaths has significantly increased, which is crucial for the study area.

Lockdown restrictions imposed during the first wave of the pandemic challenged the theories, concepts, and methods used by family sociologists and the intersecting fields of gender and social inequality. By restricting physical interactions to co-resident family members, the household regained a privileged role as a crucial social laboratory for studying the impact of COVID-19 on family life. The difficulties encountered by individuals in maintaining and dealing with close relationships across households and geographical borders, in a context in which relational proximity was discouraged by the public authorities, exposed the linked nature of family and personal relationships beyond the limits of co-residence. The main aim of this article is to investigate the social impacts of the pandemic on different types of households during the first lockdown at an early stage of the pandemic in Portugal. Drawing on an online survey applied to a non-probabilistic sample of 11,508 households between 25 and 29 March 2020, the authors combined quantitative and qualitative methods, including bi-variate inferential statistics, cluster analysis and in-depth case studies. The article distinguishes between different household types: solo, couple with and without children, extended, friendship, lone-parent families, and intermittent arrangements, such as shared custody. A cross-tabulation of the quantitative data with open-ended responses was carried out to provide a refined analysis of the household reconfigurations brought about during lockdown. The analysis showed how pre-existing unequal structural living conditions shaped the pathways leading to household reconfiguration as families sought to cope with restrictions on mobility, social distancing norms, and other lockdown measures. The findings stress that, in dealing with a crisis, multilevel welfare interventions need to be considered if governments are to cater to the differentiated social needs and vulnerabilities faced by individuals and families.","output":"Household Diversity and the Impacts of COVID-19 on Families in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), was first detected in Wuhan province in China during late December 2019 and was designated as being highly infectious. The World Health Organization (WHO) labeled it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Throughout human history, experience has shown that prejudices and viruses spread simultaneously during a viral pandemic. Outgroup members have been associated with various diseases and non-human vectors of diseases. Some epidemics have been named according to various outgroups, just as the novel coronavirus has been referred to by some as the Wuhan virus or the Chinese virus. Associating a virus with a sociodemographic group builds a false illusionary correlation, which can lead to stigmatization and discrimination. Pandemics can also stimulate violent xenophobic reactions. Besides the obvious harmful consequences for the individuals targeted, pandemic-related discrimination also affects the spread of the virus through its effect on public attitudes toward prevention and restriction, health service procurement, and in the establishment of health-related policies. It is important to first understand the relevant concepts and processes, and also to understand the underlying causes of discrimination in order to fight it. Social psychology offers multidimensional and comprehensive explanations of prejudice and discrimination. This reviews primary aim was to examine the motivations behind COVID-19-related discrimination based on social psychological perspectives. In line with this aim, the review first defines discrimination in detail, plus the related concepts and main social psychological theories on prejudice and discrimination. Then, pandemic-related discrimination in light of past experiences is discussed and explanations put forward for the theoretical perspectives and inferences specific to COVID-19.

Their improvement would reduce inequalities among various Communities/Districts or groups of Communities. A Community health index (CHI) in this regard is estimated to explore inequality ratio, inequality slope, and spatial analysis of inequalities among all Communities at regional and geographical levels. METHODS Data from Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) survey, Round-VI, 2014-15 were used to construct CHI. The index was constructed in two steps. In the first step, the study indicators were standardized while in the second step, the standardized indicators were aggregated into a single metric by applying non-linear Geometric Mean formula. RESULTS The inequality ratio of 16.59 estimated for Pakistan was found to be higher than the ratio of Atlanta city, GA (5.92), whereas, a lower slope coefficient was estimated for Pakistan than Atlanta city, GA (0.38 < 0.54). This ratio of disparity was also found to be lower for urban regions as compared to rural (7.78 < 17.54). While the slope coefficient was slightly higher for urban regions (0.45 > 0.43). The results of the spatial analysis revealed different patterns of inequalities. A cluster of healthy districts was found in Punjab province, whereas districts from Baluchistan had made a bunch of deprived/unhealthy districts in terms of CHI scores. Besides, separate maps for all provinces showed that capital districts of all provinces were relatively well-off/developed. CONCLUSION The instant results concluded that inequalities in access to health and health-related indicators exist across countries as well as across geographical regions.

Hence, specific clinics had been established in order to better characterize and manage this emerging entity of Post-COVID, among them our Cardio-COVID Clinic, which is dedicated to the cardiovascular (CV) aspects of the phenomenon. AIM: To present the experience of our Cardio-COVID Clinic. METHODS: Included in this report are 76 adult patients seen at the clinic between June 2020 and March 2021, who have recovered from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID, and who were suspected by their referring physicians to experience ongoing cardiac sequelae. All participants underwent a structured assessment by a single cardiologist, which consisted of history taking, physical examination (PE), electrocardiogram (ECG), trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and further tests as deemed appropriate, including any combination of Holter, ischemic provocation test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and cardiac computed tomography (CCT). RESULTS: Initial visits occurred within a median of 131 days after diagnosis. Most participants (83%) were referred from our general Long-COVID Clinic. About half were males, and the mean age was 53 years. 18% of participants had prior CV conditions, and the majority (72%) had at least one CV risk factor, mostly dyslipidemia. Nearly all participants experienced a symptomatic acute illness, which was graded according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria as severe in 23% of the study cohort. As for Post-COVID, late symptoms were present in 97% of patients, the most common being dyspnea (57%). While PE was unremarkable in all but 3 patients who exhibited murmurs, ECG findings were revealed in 45% C mostly non-specific ST-T changes (31%) and conduction abnormalities (14%) C and TTE aberrations were discovered in 28% C including pericardial effusion (24%), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (5%), grade 2 diastolic dysfunction (3%), moderate and up valvular dysfunction (1%), and systolic pulmonary hypertension (1%); right ventricular function was universally normal. Upon conclusion of the work-up, CV diagnoses were made in 8 (11%) patients C including myocarditis (4), myopericarditis (1), inappropriate sinus tachycardia (1), chronotropic incompetence (1), and an aberrant coronary (1). Of note, CPET and CMR had the highest diagnostic yield, in light of 57% positive results on each C followed by CCT, Holter, and provocation test. Interesting as well, among those with abnormal CMR findings, 40% had normal ECG's and TTE's. Also, none of the CV restraints on CPET translated to provocation test anomalies. CONCLUSION: CV symptoms of Post-COVID are highly prevalent, but signify actual CV disease only in a minority of patients. Further research is needed that will help identify predictors for CV morbidity and define optimal clinical pathways.

The largest weekly drop of 48% relative to 2019 occurred the week beginning 30 March. Activity recovered more slowly than it fell, and by the end of the study period remained 16% lower than the equivalent week in 2019. Changes in patterns of attendances were broadly similar across most patient characteristic groups. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of attendances taking place remotely, peaking at more than one in three during April and May 2020. Differences were observed in trends of remote consultations between age and sex categories, ethnic groups, and proxy deprivation levels. There was also substantial variation in overall activity and use of remote consultations by clinical specialty.

The current diagnostic criteria for TTS are thrombosis (venous or arterial) within 4-42 days of AZ vaccine, thrombocytopenia and presence of an antibody to platelet factor 4 (PF4)[4, 5]. TTS commonly presents with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) or splanchnic vessel thrombosis (SVT), but outside of TTS, CVST and SVT are uncommon, with an overall incidence of less than 0.5 per 100,000 [5-7]. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are also associated with TTS, however the background incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is much higher, with 1-2 events per 1000 patients per year[7, 8]. Therefore, many patients will present with new VTE and a recent exposure to the AZ vaccine, requiring consideration of investigation for TTS. Recent data suggests that PF4 antibodies can be seen in up to 8% of patients without thrombosis but following AZ vaccination[9]. We hypothesised in patients with recent AZ vaccination, new VTE but with a normal platelet count, that the incidence of a PF4 antibody is similar to this background rate of PF4 positivity. If confirmed, then presence of a normal platelet count despite new VTE and recent vaccination may exclude TTS without the need for PF4 antibody testing. We present our preliminary data on the rates of PF4 antibody positivity amongst patients with VTE, recent AZ vaccination and a normal platelet count at presentation. Aim and Methods To assess the incidence of PF4 ELISA positive results in patients with confirmed VTE, recent vaccination (within 4-42 days) with the first dose of AZ vaccine, and platelet count greater than 150x10 9/L. A retrospective audit of cases referred with suspected TTS to Monash Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, and New South Wales Health Pathology at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and St George Hospital sites Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, for testing for anti PF4 antibodies from 1 st April to 31 st July 2021. Patient sera were tested for the Anti-PF4 antibody using the STAGO Asserachrom HPIA IgG ELISA (Asnires sur Seine, France). For patients with a positive PF4 antibody test additional testing was sought for either the presence of platelet activating antibodies with a flow cytometry-based assay or the presence of spontaneous serotonin release without heparin in the serotonin release assay. Results From April 1 st to July 31 st 350 tests were run on 332 patients. 91 patients met our criteria, of whom 51 were female and 40 male, with a median age of 73 years. Median platelet count at presentation was 226x10 9/L, and median D dimer values were 10 times the upper limit of normal. 86 patients had either DVT, PE or both, including 2 with upper limb DVT, and 5 patients had PE with concurrent arterial events (1 axillary artery thrombosis, 3 arterial strokes, 1 coronary artery thrombosis). Further details are presented in table 1. 82 patient samples tested negative for anti-PF4 antibodies by ELISA, 5 were positive, and were 4 weak positive/equivocal (see table 2 for further details). Of the positive results, 3 had functional testing available, of which 2 were negative, and 1 showed discordant results, with a positive SRA but negative flow cytometry. None of the weak positive/equivocal cases had functional testing results available. Of the negative ELISA results, 5 patients had functional testing results available, of which 4 were negative. One of these cases had positive testing by flow cytometry, but negative by SRA (case included in table 2). Conclusion In our Australian cohort of patients with their first dose of AZ vaccine and new VTE within 4-42days, but a normal platelet count (therefore not fulfilling the clinical criteria of TTS), the incidence of a positive PF4 antibody test was 9/91 (9.9%, 95% CI 3.7-15.9%) and only one had evidence of platelet activating antibodies. This observed rate is similar to that observed in healthy patients wi hout thrombosis who received AZ vaccination as described by Thiele et. al., 2021. Further confirmation in a larger cohort of VTE patients is required, but if confirmed, then PF4 ELISA testing in patients with VTE and normal platelet count post AZ vaccine may not be required, and should give clinicians confidence to institute routine management.

The NHSP is composed of the National Cancer Screening Programs (NCSPs) and general health checkups. NCSPs, started in 1999, included screenings for stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and uterine cervical cancers, and they may have contributed to the improved cancer survival rate from 42.9% in 1993-1995 to 77.5% in 2013-2017 in Korea. General health check-ups included lifestyle questionnaires, anthropometric measurements; blood pressure measurement; visual acuity test; hearing test; laboratory tests including fasting glucose, lipid profile, liver function tests, creatinine, and urinalysis; and, chest radiography. Additionally, bone density, cognitive function, and depression were assessed.

We present a case study on oxygen access from 58 health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria. We found large differences in oxygen access between facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe four key domains to consider when measuring oxygen access. Use: 8/58 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter for detecting hypoxaemia (low blood oxygen level) and guiding oxygen care. Oximeters were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%), or operating theatre (4/27, 15%), not suitable for children, and infrequently used. Availability: 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating theatre or maternity ward. Cost: Oxygen was free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2 days oxygen 13000 ($36 USD) and 27500 ($77 USD) naira, respectively. Patient access: No facilities were adequately equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands for patients. We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen therapy with available data. We highlight the importance of a multi-faceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses access at the point-of-care, and ideally at the patient-level. We propose standard metrics to report oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems and existing health facility assessment tools.","output":"Measuring Oxygen Access: lessons from health facility assessments in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An immunocompetent toddler came to medication attention with gastroenteritis, complicated by encephalopathy and hepatitis.

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the impact on cancer diagnostic service in public facilities across Hong Kong. Quantifying the temporal changes in the number of cancer diagnoses before, during, and after the outbreak is useful to establish the scale of the problem and assess if there has been an adequate level of response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide database in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2020, and consecutive specimens received for pathologic diagnosis in public laboratories in 41 hospitals were retrieved. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 455,453 pathologic specimens were received, which amounted to a 15.5% reduction compared with the prior 3-year average (P < .001). An analysis of confirmed malignant pathologic diagnoses revealed a statistically significant reduction in colorectal (-10.0%; P < .001) and prostate (-19.7%; P < .001), nonsignificant reduction in lung (-3.0%; P = .0526), and a marginal but nonsignificant increase for breast (0.7%; P = .7592) regions. Based on time series projection data, the estimated missed cancers for the 3 regions with reduced investigations were colorectal (10.0%), lung (3.0%), and prostate (19.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Variable impact on actual malignant pathologic diagnoses based on 4 body regions was observed, with a statistically significant reduction in colorectal, lung, and prostate regions, and marginal but insignificant increase in breast regions.

However, an excessive clarification of the musts can lead to the reduction of volatile compound concentrations and, as a consequence, modify the sensorial properties of the wines. Therefore, in this study, the influence of two pre-fermentation clarification techniques (static settling and flotation) on the concentrations of volatile compounds has been assessed in Albari?o and Treixadura wines. Fermentations were performed at an industrial scale. Volatile compounds have been identified and quantified by gas chromatography (FID and mass spectrometry detection) and expert panelists assessed the sensory properties of the final wines. The results showed effects of the clarification techniques on the volatile composition of wines from both varieties. Flotation significantly increased the concentrations of benzyl alcohol in Treixadura wines, whereas this technique increased the concentration of 1-hexanol, octanoic acid, and furfural in Albari?o wines, but without exceeding the corresponding perception thresholds. Panelists tended to score higher the wines coming from flotation, which, together with the shorter application time, makes this technique suitable for clarifying the musts of these two white varieties.","output":"Influence of Must Clarification Technique on the Volatile Composition of Albari?o and Treixadura Wines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies showed that nasal high flow (NHF) with or without supplemental oxygen can assist ventilation of patients with chronic respiratory and sleep disorders. The hypothesis of this study was to test whether NHF can clear dead space in two different models of the upper nasal airways. The first was a simple tube model consisting of a nozzle to simulate the nasal valve area, connected to a cylindrical tube to simulate the nasal cavity. The second was a more complex anatomically representative upper airway model, constructed from segmented CT-scan images of a healthy volunteer. After filling the models with tracer gases, NHF was delivered at rates of 15, 30, and 45 l/min. The tracer gas clearance was determined using dynamic infrared CO2 spectroscopy and 81mKr-gas radioactive gamma camera imaging. There was a similar tracer-gas clearance characteristic in the tube model and the upper airway model: clearance half-times were below 1.0 s and decreased with increasing NHF rates. For both models, the anterior compartments demonstrated faster clearance levels (half-times < 0.5 s) and the posterior sections showed slower clearance (half-times < 1.0 s). Both imaging methods showed similar flow-dependent tracer-gas clearance in the models. For the anatomically based model, there was complete tracer-gas removal from the nasal cavities within 1.0 s. The level of clearance in the nasal cavities increased by 1.8 ml/s for every 1.0 l/min increase in the rate of NHF. The study has demonstrated the fast-occurring clearance of nasal cavities by NHF therapy, which is capable of reducing of dead space rebreathing.","output":"Nasal high flow clears anatomical dead space in upper airway models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: The primary aim was to assess the rate of patient deferral of elective orthopaedic surgery and whether this changed with time during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The secondary aim was to explore the reasons why patients wanted to defer surgery and what measures/circumstances would enable them to go forward with surgery. Methods: Patients were randomly selected from elective orthopaedic waiting lists at three centres in the UK in April, June, August, and September 2020 and were contacted by telephone. Patients were asked whether they wanted to proceed or defer surgery. Patients who wished to defer were asked seven questions relating to potential barriers to proceeding with surgery and were asked whether there were measures/circumstances that would allow them to go forward with surgery. Results: There was a significant decline in the rate of deferral for surgery from April (n = 38/50, 76%), June (n = 68/233, 29%), to August (n = 6/50, 12%) and September (n = 5/100, 5%) (p < 0.001). Patients wishing to defer were older (68 years (SD 10.1) vs 65 (SD 11.9)), more likely to be female (65% (44/68) vs 53% (88/165)) and waiting for a knee arthroplasty (65% (44/68) vs 41% (67/165); p < 0.001). By September 2020, all patients that deferred in June at one centre had proceeded or wanted to proceed with surgery due to a perceived lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 perioperatively (68%, n = 15) or because their symptoms had progressed (32%, n = 7). The most common reason (n = 14/17, 82%) for patients deferring surgery in September was the perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 while as an inpatient. When asked what measures or circumstances would enable them to proceed with surgery, the most common (n = 7, 41%) response was reassurance of a COVID-19 free hospital. Conclusion: The rate of deferral fell to 5% by September, which was due to a lower perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 perioperatively or worsening of symptoms while waiting. The potential of a COVID-19-free hospital and communication of mortality risk may improve a patient's willingness to go forward with surgery.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-10:663-668.","output":"The rate of patient deferral and barriers to going forward with elective orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amblyomma maculatum Koch sensu lato (s.l.) ticks are the vector of Rickettsia parkeri in Arizona, where nine cases of R. parkeri rickettsiosis have been identified since the initial case in 2014.

Understanding the molecular determinants of Omicrons transmissibility will impact development of intervention strategies. Here we map the electrostatic potential surface of the Spike protein to show that major SARS-CoV-2 variants have accumulated positive charges in solvent-exposed regions of the Spike protein, especially its ACE2-binding interface. Significantly, the Omicron Spike-ACE2 complex has complementary electrostatic surfaces. In contrast, interfaces between Omicron and neutralizing antibodies tend to have similar positively charged surfaces. Structural modeling demonstrates that the electrostatic property of Omicrons Spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) plays a role in enhancing ACE2 recognition and destabilizing Spike-antibody complexes. Collectively, our structural analysis implies that Omicron S RBD interaction interfaces have been optimized to simultaneously promote access to human ACE2 receptors and evade antibodies. These findings suggest that electrostatic interactions are a major contributing factor for increased Omicron transmissibility relative to other variants.","output":"Omicron Spike protein has a positive electrostatic surface that promotes ACE2 recognition and antibody escape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate how the restrictive measures implemented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have influenced the incidence of the most common childrens diseases and the consumption of medications in 2020 compared to 2019.

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection potentiates early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : With the continuous development of sensing technology, people begin to use all kinds of sensors to monitor the human condition, such as early rising ECG instrument Although this kind of equipment has the characteristics of high precision and high sensitivity, it has the defects of large volume, high power consumption, harsh use conditions and high cost With the continuous development of wireless sensor network technology and integration technology, it is more and more possible to design a device with small size, high mobility and greatly reduced cost on the premise of maintaining the advantages of dual height The purpose of this study is to explore how to apply wireless sensor network technology to clinical field, and to study the exact benefits of wireless sensor network technology for clinical neighborhood Methods : Body temperature is an important monitoring index of whether there is abnormality in human body Taking this as a breakthrough, we designed a real- time temperature acquisition device that can be worn on the arm of patients for a long time by using wireless sensor network technology and high- sensitivity sensor (sensitivity &lt; 0 1C) In addition, in order to complete the normal transmission of body temperature data, we also designed data aggregation node, gateway node and data processing platform Through the system, the patient's temperature data can be monitored by the medical staff in real time Results : Compared with the traditional methods of body temperature measurement (mercury thermometer, infrared thermometer), With the same accuracy, it can record the patient's temperature change in more detail (usually the temperature measurement in the hospital is tested every 6 hours, while the system can be tested every 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours, and the test interval only needs to be completed through the system setting) The use of the system can greatly reduce the workload of medical staff (from the perspective of temperature measurement alone, it subverts the traditional way of temperature measurement, from a way of medical staff to a way of patient to a way of system automatically recording the patient's temperature data, which can be viewed by medical staff when they need to), and it can realize the non- contact temperature monitoring between doctors and patients, which can control infectious diseases such as SARS, novel coronavirus is of great significance Conclusions : The combination of sensor technology, low power consumption technology, integration technology and wireless sensor network makes it possible to realize medical grade physical examination equipment with high precision, long time and easy to carry This kind of equipment can greatly reduce the nursing workload of medical staff for patients Reliable and accurate data also provides powerful data support for the treatment of patients later","output":"A wireless sensor technology' application in clinical nursing of hospital internet of things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The irrational use of antibiotics has led to a high emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria The traditional overuse of antibiotics in the animal feed industry plays a crucial role in the emergence of these pathogens that pose both economic and health problems In addition, antibiotics have also recently experienced an increase to treat companion animal infections, promoting the emergence of MDR bacteria in pets, which can reach humans Phages have been proposed as an alternative for antibiotics for the treatment of livestock and companion animal infections due to their multiple advantages as adaptative drugs, such as their ability to evolve, to multiply at the site of infections, and their high specificity Moreover, phage-derived enzymes may also be an interesting approach However, the lack of regulation for this type of pharmaceutical hinders its potential commercialization In this review, we summarize the main recent studies on phage therapy in livestock and companion animals, providing an insight into current advances in this area and the future of treatments for bacterial infections","output":"Phage Therapy in Livestock and Companion Animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While patients with cancer are known to be at increased risk of infection in part due to the immunocompromising nature of cancer treatments, recent data indicate a particularly high risk for COVID-19 infection and poor outcomes (Wang et al., 2020). A recent study (Meltzer et al., 2020) demonstrated Vitamin D deficiency may increase risk of COVID-19 infection, and a small randomized controlled trial in Spain reported significant improvement in mortality among hospitalized patients treated with calcifediol. Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in two leading causes of cancer deaths: breast and prostate. In this study, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis on nationally representative electronic medical records (EMR) to assess whether Vitamin D deficiency affects risk of COVID-19 among these patients. Methods: Patients with breast (female) or prostate (male) cancer were identified between 3/1/2018 and 3/1/2020 from EMR data provided pro-bono by the COVID-19 Research Database (covid19researchdatabase.org ). Patients with an ICD-10 code for Vitamin D deficiency or < 20ng/mL 20(OH)D laboratory result within 12 months prior to 3/1/2020 were classified as Vitamin D deficient. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined using ICD-10 codes and laboratory results for COVID-19 at any time after 3/1/2020. Logistic regressions, adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, were conducted to estimate the effect of Vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 incidence in each cancer cohort. Results: A total of 16,287 breast cancer and 14,919 prostate cancer patients were included in the study. The average age was 68.9 years in the breast cancer cohort and 73.6 years in the prostate cancer cohort. The breast cancer cohort consisted of 85% Whites, 13% Black or African Americans, and less than 5% of other races. A similar race distribution was observed in the prostate cancer cohort. Unadjusted analysis showed the risk of COVID-19 was higher among Vitamin D deficient patients compared to non-deficient patients in both cohorts (breast: OR = 1.60 [95% C.I.: 1.15, 2.20];prostate: OR = 1.59 [95% C.I.: 1.08, 2.33]). Similar findings were observed when assessed in subgroups of patients with newly diagnosed cancer in the dataset, as well as after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Conclusions: Our study suggests breast and prostate cancer patients may have an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection if Vitamin D deficient. These results support findings by Meltzer et al., 2020 demonstrating a relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection. While a randomized clinical trial is warranted to confirm the role for Vitamin D supplementation in preventing COVID-19, our study underscores the importance of monitoring Vitamin D levels across and within cancer populations, particularly in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Assessment of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with breast or prostate cancer using electronic medical records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mortality rates in patients receiving anticancer therapy in the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period.

The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety of excisional atherectomy with the TurboHawk atherectomy device (Covidien/ev3, Plymouth, MN, USA) in the treatment of lower limb peripheral vascular disease and to evaluate the learning curve involved in the institution of a new treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing atherectomy for symptomatic lower limb peripheral vascular disease by a single clinician between November 2011 and June 2013. Forty-seven vessels on 28 legs in 24 patients were treated during the period. RESULTS Atherectomy was possible in 98% of cases. The 6- and 12-month primary patency was 72.6 and 58.9%, respectively. The primary-assisted patency was 93.2% at 6 months and 74.6% at 12 months. There were significantly greater patency rates in the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A + B lesions and a non-significant trend towards improved patency rates in claudicants versus critical limb ischaemia.

Little is known about predictors of nephrologist performance in MIPS. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Nephrologists participating in MIPS in performance year 2018. PREDICTORS: Nephrologist characteristics: (1) participation type (individual, group, or MIPS alternative payment model [APM]), (2) practice size, (3) practice setting (rural, Health Professional Shortage Area [HPSA], or hospital based), and (4) geography (Census Division). OUTCOMES: MIPS Final, Quality, Promoting Interoperability, Improvement Activities, and Cost scores. Using published consensus ratings, we also examined the validity of MIPS Quality measures selected by nephrologists. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted linear regression models assessing the associations between nephrologist characteristics and MIPS Final scores. RESULTS: Among 6,117 nephrologists participating in MIPS in 2018, the median MIPS Final score was 100 (interquartile range, 94-100). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, MIPS APM participation was associated with a 12.5-point (95% CI, 10.6-14.4) higher score compared with individual participation. Nephrologists in large (355-4,294 members) and medium (15-354 members) practices scored higher than those in small practices (1-14 members). In analyses adjusted for practice size, practice setting, and geography, among individual and group participants, HPSA nephrologists scored 1.9 (95% CI, ?3.6 to ?0.1) points lower than non-HPSA nephrologists, and hospital-based nephrologists scored 6.0 (95% CI, ?8.3 to ?3.7) points lower than nonChospital-based nephrologists. The most frequently reported quality measures by individual and group participants had medium to high validity and were relevant to nephrology care, whereas MIPS APM measures had little relevance to nephrology. LIMITATIONS: Lack of adjustment for patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: MIPS APM participation, larger practice size, non-HPSA setting, and nonChospital-based setting were associated with higher MIPS scores among nephrologists. Our results inform strategies to improve MIPS program design and generate meaningful distinctions between practices that will drive improvements in care.","output":"Nephrologist Performance in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Analyses for the presence of SARS-CoV?2 in the tissues of COVID-19 patients is important in order to improve our understanding of the disease pathophysiology for interpretation of diagnostic histopathological findings in autopsies, biopsies, or surgical specimens and to assess the potential for occupational infectious hazard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this review we identified 136 published studies in PubMeds curated literature database LitCovid on SARS-CoV?2 detection methods in tissues and evaluated them regarding sources of error, specificity, and sensitivity of the methods, taking into account our own experience. RESULTS: Currently, no sufficiently specific histomorphological alterations or diagnostic features for COVID-19 are known. Therefore, three approaches for SARS-CoV?2 detection are used: RNA, proteins/antigens, or morphological detection by electron microscopy. In the preanalytical phase, the dominant source of error is tissue quality, especially the different intervals between sample collection and processing or fixation (and its duration) and specifically the interval between death and sample collection in autopsies. However, this information is found in less than half of the studies (e.g., in only 42% of autopsy studies). Our own experience and first studies prove the significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of RNA-based detection methods compared to antigen or protein detection by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. Detection by electron microscopy is time consuming and difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: Different methods are available for the detection of SARS-CoV?2 in tissue. Currently, RNA detection by RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, extensive validation studies and method harmonization are not available and are absolutely necessary.

Taking Zhengzhou Zijing Mountain Subway station as the prototype, and using VR technology, a virtual subway fire escape scene was built. Combined with the total escape time, the total contact time with fire, and the total contact time with smoke, it proposed a calculation formula on emergency escape capability. A total of 34 participants with equal gender distribution were recruited to carry out the virtual subway fire escape experiment, and participants physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance) were real-time recorded by ErgoLAB V3.0 throughout the whole experiment. The emergency escape capability of each participant was evaluated quantitatively, and the related influencing factors were analyzed. The results show that for the age ranges (19C22 years old) in the experiment, the emergency escape capability of women is significantly lower than that of men (p < 0.05); although there is no significance in emergency escape capability in DISC personality types (p > 0.05), the mean emergency escape capability of people with influence personality type is the worst, and that of people with compliance type is the best; during virtual fire escape vs. baseline, Mean_SC and Mean_HR both increased very significantly (all p < 0.01), and participants were under stress during their virtual fire escape. There is a significant negative correlation between emergency escape capability and LF_increase_rate (p < 0.05), and a remarkably significant negative correlation between emergency escape capability and LF/HF_increase_rate (p < 0.01); the greater the increase rate of LF or LF/HF, the smaller the emergency escape capability, with excessive stress probably not being conducive to emergency escape. There is a very significant negative correlation between an individuals emergency escape capability and the degree of familiarity with the Zijing Mountain subway station (p < 0.01).

The security of computers, systems, and applications has been an active area of research in computer science for decades. However, with the confluence of both the scale of interconnected systems and increased adoption of artificial intelligence, there are many research challenges the community must face so that our society can continue to benefit and risks are minimized, not multiplied. Those challenges range from security and trust of the information ecosystem to adversarial artificial intelligence and machine learning. Along with basic research challenges, more often than not, securing a system happens after the design or even deployment, meaning the security community is routinely playing catch-up and attempting to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited any minute. While security measures such as encryption and authentication have been widely adopted, questions of security tend to be secondary to application capability.

DesignProspectively defined observational study using registry data. SettingFour acute NHS Hospitals in east London. ParticipantsPatients aged []16 years with an emergency hospital admission with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st September 2020 and 17th February 2021. Main outcome measuresPrimary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of index COVID-19 hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were 90-day mortality and need for ICU admission. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnicity and mortality accounting for predefined risk factors. Age-standardised rates of hospital admission relative to the local population were compared between ethnic groups. ResultsOf 5533 patients, the ethnic distribution was White (n=1805, 32.6%), Asian/Asian British (n=1983, 35.8%), Black/Black British (n=634, 11.4%), Mixed/Other (n=433, 7.8%), and unknown (n=678, 12.2%). Excluding 678 patients with missing data, 4855 were included in multivariable analysis. Relative to the White population, Asian and Black populations experienced 4.1 times (3.77-4.39) and 2.1 times (1.88-2.33) higher rates of age-standardised hospital admission. After adjustment for various patient risk factors including age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation, Asian patients were at significantly higher risk of death within 30 days (HR 1.47 [1.24-1.73]). No association with increased risk of death in hospitalised patients was observed for Black or Mixed/Other ethnicity. ConclusionsAsian and Black ethnic groups continue to experience poor outcomes following COVID-19. Despite higher-than-expected rates of admission, Black and Asian patients experienced similar or greater risk of death in hospital, implying a higher overall risk of COVID-19 associated death in these communities.

The development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine could limit the morbidity and mortality caused by infection, and may enable the relaxation of social distancing measures. Age is one of the most significant risk factors for poor health outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, therefore it is desirable that any new vaccine candidates elicit a robust immune response in older adults. Methods Here, we use in-depth immunophenotyping to characterize the innate and adaptive immune response induced upon intramuscular administration of the adenoviral vectored ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD-1222) COVID-19 vaccine candidate in mice. Findings A single vaccination generates spike-specific Th1 cells, Th1-like Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, polyfunctional spike-specific CD8+ T cells and granzyme B producing CD8 effectors. Spike-specific IgG and IgM are generated from both the early extrafollicular antibody response and the T follicular helper cell-supported germinal centre reaction, which is associated with the production of virus neutralising antibodies. A single dose of this vaccine generated a similar type of immune response in aged mice, but of a reduced magnitude than in younger mice. We report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice. Conclusions This study shows that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces both cellular and humoral immunity in adult and aged mice, and suggests a prime-boost strategy is a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons.

In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population.

Combining bioconjugation methodology with ice templating technique, we show here the development of a new class of multifunctional and biocatalytic scaffold-like spongy material fabricated from an aqueous solution of enzyme-polymer surfactant (enzyme-PS) core-shell conjugates, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated silica/silk nanoparticles. The generality of this process is demonstrated by the fabrication of biocatalytic sponges comprising PEI coated nanoparticles and core-shell conjugates of alkaline phosphatase (ALP-PS), or glucose oxidase (GOx-PS), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP-PS). We show that ALP-PS conjugate driven biocatalytic transformations can be simply achieved by saturating the highly porous, and manoeuvrable sponges with the p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate solution. Subsequently, the compressible and elastic property of the sponge can be utilized for the extrusion of the product, p-nitrophenol, by applying controlled and normal mechanical stress. Further, the sponges can be washed and recycled upto ten times, with approximately 67% retention of initial biocatalytic activity. Interestingly, the ALP-PS conjugate based sponges exhibit mechanoresponsive catalytic behaviour; the amount of product obtained over 25 minutes of reaction time can be increased by approx. 8 times by compressing-decompressing the sponge after every 15 seconds. This is attributed to the change in mass transfer and diffusion of the substrate within the porous channels of the sponge. We also highlight the importance of bioconjugation of enzymes for fabricating such sponges; our results show that, whilst the native enzymes either denature or are leached away during the fabrication/biocatalytic usage, their enzyme-PS conjugate counterparts integrate efficiently to form sturdy, robust, highly catalytic, and recyclable sponge material.","output":"Mechanoresponsive and recyclable biocatalytic sponges from enzyme-polymer surfactant conjugates and nanoparticles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to highlight the role of mutual assistance of China and Pakistan's regional connectivity through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and show what lessons can be learned by Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs).

Biolubrication gets impaired due to diseases such as osteoarthritis, in which cartilage damage results from alterations in synovial fluid and lamina splendens composition. Osteoarthritis is treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) orally or via intra-articular injection, but due to the poor adsorption of HA on the cartilage surface in the absence of adhesive molecules, pain relief is temporary. Here, we describe how natural lubrication on degraded cartilage surface can be restored with the help of a bioinspired mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan catechol (Chi-C). Quartz crystal microbalance was used to mimic the formation of lamina splendens in vitro, known as synovial fluid conditioning films (SyCF), and colloidal probe atomic force microscopy was used to measure their nanoscale frictional properties. Clear evidence of glycoprotein (PRG4) recruitment by Chi-C increased the softness of SyCF, which also improved nanoscale lubrication in vitro, decreasing the friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.03. At the macroscale, cartilage damage induced by Chondroitinase ABC increased the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.07  0.04 (healthy tissue) to 0.15  0.03 (after tissue damage) in the presence of synovial fluid after sliding for 50 min.

At each level the framework of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention can be applied.Primary Prevention (intervening before health is impacted): reducing academic stress;resilience interventions;mentorship;peer support;brief interventions to avoid progress to established disorders.Secondary Prevention (reducing prevalence of disorder): early detection through staff training and screening;treatment referral pathways;reciprocal arrangements if peers are placed within local settings.Tertiary Prevention (reducing impairment): reasonable adjustments, communicated between placementsThis recognises that medical students require a range of interventions at multiple levels to reduce stress, promote wellbeing and manage the spectrum of mental health difficulties they may encounter. The ecological framework also acknowledges the reciprocity of individuals being influenced by and influencing their environment, which aligns with the concept of co-production.","output":"A framework for nurturing doctors: systematic review of wellbeing interventions in medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in China in December 2019, and has spread rapidly to more than 200 countries and areas in four months. A few studies have reported that transmissibility exists during the late incubation period based on one single infection cluster caused by SARS-CoV-2. Here based on 178 SARS-CoV-2 clusters confirmed in Zhejiang Province, we analyzed the epidemic link between all 212 secondary cases with their previous cases, and found 49 secondary cases (from 26 clusters), which were 23.11% (49/212) of the total secondary cases infected from previous cases during the latters incubation period. The median days from the last exposure of secondary cases to the onset of previous cases was 2.0 days (IQR: 1.00~5.00 days, 90th percentile: 9.00 days) .This study has shown transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period and indicated that some cases might be infectious soon after they were exposed to a prior transmitter. The results highlight the importance of extending the contact group for medical observation and isolation to those in contact with the index case nine (90th percentile) or more days before the latters illness onset, when medical resources were sufficient.","output":"Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 during incubation period: Epidemiologic evidence from 178 confirmed clusters in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the objectives of the H2020 DIAMOND project, the paper investigates womens needs and expectations as users of the bike-sharing service managed by Syndicat Mixte Autolib et Velib Mtropole in the territory of Paris Region-Petite Couronne (France). The paper presents a thematic literature review focused on gender inclusion in bike-sharing schemes. The proposed methodological approach is based on (i) Geographic Information Systems for the analysis of geolocated open datasets related to land, sociodemographic and mobility characteristics of the areas surrounding each docking stations. This was aimed at identifying a short list of suitable bike-sharing docking stations, which were further characterized through: (ii) structured proprietary data focused on travel demand;(iii) onsite observations focused on universal design indicators;(iv) survey questionnaires focused on womens concerns, needs and expectations;and (v) social media data from Twitter focused on the opinion of the end-users. Results showed that women use the VELIBs bike-sharing service much less than men (about 30% of the total number of users), since they are more concerned about the following issues: accessibility (e.g., availability of bikes at the docking stations, distance to the nearest station, type and quality of the cycle paths);safety and security (e.g., perception of danger and insecurity while cycling and using the current bicycle infrastructures);social constraints (e.g., perceptions and cultural stigmatization associated with cycling and bike-sharing);weather and topography (e.g., impact of weather and the urban terrain on cycling and bike-sharing).

Three pregnant sows were inoculated intranasally with 6 mL of tissue culture fluid containing 1.2  10(5) tissue culture infective doses 50% (TCID(50))/mL of PCV2 strain SNUVR000470 three weeks before the expected farrowing date. Three control pregnant sows were similarly exposed to uninfected cell culture supernatants. Thirty piglets from PCV2-infected sows were randomly assigned to two groups (A and B) of 15 piglets each. Another 30 piglets from noninfected sows were randomly assigned to two groups (C and D) of 15 piglets each. The piglets in groups A and C were dosed orally at three days of age with 2 mL of virus stock (1  10(6.5) TCID(50)/mL) of the PEDV strain, SNUVR971496, at the third passage. The mean villous height and crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio in PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows (group A) were significantly different from those of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C) at 36, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) (P < 0.05). In PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows (group A), significantly more PEDV nucleic acid was detected in the jejunal tissues (P < 0.05) at 24 hpi than in the same tissues of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C). Thereafter, at 36, 48, 60, and 70 hpi significantly more PEDV nucleic acid (P < 0.05) was detected in the jejunal tissues of the PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (group C) than those of the PEDV-infected piglets from the PCV2-infected sows (group A).

Using the current extraction rate, the previous years extraction rate, and interest rates of the Federal Reserve we use linear regression to give a model for oil prices from 1966 to 2018. The model verifies that deductions made from the explicit price equation are consistent with empirical data over the given time period.

METHOD: A 58-item anonymous online survey was distributed during the period 30th April to 10th May via Qualtrics. The survey explored: a) demographic characteristics (age, sex, general health and where they were living during lockdown), b) changes in their contact lens use during lockdown, c) hygiene and contact lens compliance and d) concerns associated with contact lens wear and ways to support wearers during the pandemic. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty responses were analysed (38.8a?a?11.4 years old, 75% female). Three-quarters of participants reported that they were self-isolating or rigorously following social distancing advice. Sixty-seven percent of participants reported using their contact lenses less during the pandemic. Respondents were found to be compliant with handwashing prior to inserting and removing contact lenses (in both cases 97% doing this 'most times' or 'every time'). However, only 44 % complied with the '20a?s rule' and 48 % used a shared towel to dry their hands. A higher proportion of hydrogen peroxide users replaced the lens case monthly compared to multi-purpose users (64% vs.49%; pa?<a?0.001). Twenty-four percent admitted wearing lenses whilst showering and 16% did not consider ceasing lens wear if feeling unwell with flu/cold symptoms. CONCLUSION: Eye care practitioners should continue to educate contact lens wearers to ensure safe contact lens wear to minimise the chance of developing contact lens related complications during the pandemic. Modifiable factors that need particular attention in Spain include: handwashing for at least 20s before lens handling, drying hands with single use paper towels, including a rub-and-rinse step for reusable lenses, lens case cleaning and renewal, avoidance of water exposure and when to cease lens wear during the pandemic.","output":"Contact lens wear and care in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Airline Group of the International Federation of Operations Research (AGIFORS) held a conference in October 2020 that included keynote addresses from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Airbus, as well as three panels that included representatives from 11 airlines throughout the world that focused on how COVID-19 is impacting and reshaping the airline industry This paper presents key themes that emerged from these discussions, including the impact of border closures on airline operations and demand forecasts;the shift in development priorities within revenue management departments;and outlooks for how passenger preferences, booking curves, and fare product restrictions may change after the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"How COVID-19 is impacting and reshaping the airline industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing situation, when the world is dominated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the development of self-care programs appears to be insufficient, while their role in mental health may be crucial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations between self-care activities and depression in the general Slovak population, but also in its individual gender and age categories. This was achieved by validating the self-care screening instrument, assessing differences, and evaluating the associations using quantile regression analysis. The final research sample consisted of 806 participants [males: 314 (39%), females: 492 (61%)] and data were collected through an online questionnaire from February 12, 2021 to February 23, 2021. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression ( = 0.89) and Self-Care Activities Screening Scale (SASS-14) [health consciousness (HC) ( = 0.82), nutrition and physical activity (NPA) ( = 0.75), sleep quality (SLP) ( = 0.82), and interpersonal and intrapersonal coping strategies (IICS) ( = 0.58)] were used as screening measures. Mild depressive symptoms were found in 229 participants (28.41%), moderate depressive symptoms in 154 participants (19.11%), moderately severe depressive symptoms in 60 participants (7.44%) and severe depressive symptoms in 43 participants (5.33%). The main findings revealed the fact that individual self-care activities were associated with depression. This supported the idea that well-practiced self-care activities should be an immediate part of an individual's life in order to reduce depressive symptoms. Sleep quality played an important role, while HC indicated the need for increased attention. Other dimensions of self-care also showed significant results that should not be overlooked. In terms of depression, females and younger individuals need targeted interventions. The supportive educational intervention developed based on the self-care theory can help manage and maintain mental health during a stressful period, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policy leaders should focus on health-promoting preventive self-care interventions, as the demand for them increases even more during the pandemic.","output":"The Role of Self-Care Activities (SASS-14) in Depression (PHQ-9): Evidence From Slovakia During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in preclinical and clinical trials for various diseases and have shown great potential in the treatment of sepsis and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Inflammatory factors play vital roles in the pathogenesis of diseases. The interaction between inflammatory factors is extremely complex. Once the dynamics of inflammatory factors are unbalanced, inflammatory responses and cytokine storm syndrome develop, leading to disease exacerbation and even death. Stem cells have become ideal candidates for the treatment of such diseases due to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms by which stem cells affect inflammation and immune regulation are still unclear. This article discusses the therapeutic mechanism and potential value of MSCs in the treatment of sepsis and the novel COVID-19, outlines how MSCs mediate innate and acquired immunity at both the cellular and molecular levels, and described the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and related molecular pathways.

RESULTS CT provides additional information that is useful for selecting patients for surgical correction and for planning the surgery. Traditional radiographic indices (vertebral, frontosagittal) provide reasonable approximations of the CT-determined dimensions but these seem to correlate poorly with the severity of clinical signs. Kittens commonly have lateralised deformities, which are associated with less severe clinical signs, while those with midline deformities are associated with more severe clinical signs. Six of seven kittens with severe PE that had a ventral splint applied for 4 weeks had excellent medium-term outcomes.

METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 infection test data (n = 4509 tests; 1325 positive) from Public Health England, linked to the UK Biobank study, we explored the contribution of demographic, social, health risk, medical and environmental factors to COVID-19 risk. We used multivariable and penalized logistic regression models for the risk of (i) being tested, (ii) testing positive/negative in the study population and, adopting a test negative design, (iii) the risk of testing positive within the tested population. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, variables independently associated with the risk of being tested for COVID-19 with odds ratio >1.05 were: male sex; Black ethnicity; social disadvantage (as measured by education, housing and income); occupation (healthcare worker, retired, unemployed); ever smoker; severely obese; comorbidities; and greater exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance. Of these, only male sex, non-White ethnicity and lower educational attainment, and none of the comorbidities or health risk factors, were associated with testing positive among tested individuals.

In this work, we systematically analyze the three types of recognition abilities of BioNER models: memorization, synonym generalization, and concept generalization. We find that although BioNER models achieve state-of-the-art performance on BioNER benchmarks based on overall performance, they have limitations in identifying synonyms and new biomedical concepts such as COVID-19. From this observation, we conclude that existing BioNER models are overestimated in terms of their generalization abilities. Also, we identify several difficulties in recognizing unseen mentions in BioNER and make the following conclusions: (1) BioNER models tend to exploit dataset biases, which hinders the models' abilities to generalize, and (2) several biomedical names have novel morphological patterns with little name regularity such as COVID-19, and models fail to recognize them. We apply a current statistics-based debiasing method to our problem as a simple remedy and show the improvement in generalization to unseen mentions.

However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors. RESULTS: 192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72 samples tested.

Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results of this study may give further insight into the use of internet-based self-help programs in pandemic-related psychological distress.

Despite recent evidence-based advances in clinical management, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with significant mortality. Detailed epidemiology is essential in guiding the recruitment of patients into trials of new therapeutic interventions, thereby improving outcome and allowing directed allocation of scarce resources. RECENT FINDINGS The incidence of acute lung injury in the United States overall (17-64 per 100,000 person-years) seems to be higher than in Europe, Australia, and other developed countries (17-34 per 100, 000 person-years). The mortality rates for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome range from 34 to 58%. The hypothesis that pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndromes are different disease entities continues to gain momentum. A genetic predisposition to acute respiratory distress syndrome may contribute to its pathogenesis and outcome. SUMMARY Recent epidemiologic studies of the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome have indicated a similar incidence in developed societies, and they confirm that mortality is falling in comparison with a decade ago. The awaited publication of new consensus guidelines for the definition of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome may render new studies necessary.","output":"Epidemiology of acute lung injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a worldwide management problem. Although there is a general effort for characterizing this population, few studies have assessed the predictive value of the echocardiographic E/e ratio in patients with acute HFpEF. The aim of the study was to identify groups with different prognosis in patients hospitalized with a first acute episode of HFpEF. Materials and Methods: The primary endpoint of the study was heart failure readmissions (HFR) at 6 months, while the secondary outcome was six-month mortality. We consecutively enrolled 91 patients hospitalized for the first time with acute HFpEF. We examined the E/e ratio as an independent predictor for HFR using univariate regression. Results: We identified and validated the E/e ratio as an independent predictor for HFR. An E/e ratio threshold value of 13.80 was calculated [(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.693, sensitivity = 78.60%, specificity = 55%, p < 0.004)] and validated as an inflection point for an increased number of HFR. Thus, we divided the study cohort into two groups: group 1 with an E/e ratio < 13.80 (n = 39) and group 2 with an E/e ratio > 13.80 (n = 49). Compared to group 1, group 2 had an increased number of HFR (p = 0.003) and a shorter time to first HFR (p = 0.002). However, this parameter did not influence all-cause mortality within six months (p = 0.84). Conclusions: The dimensionless E/e ratio is a useful discriminator between patients with acute HFpEF. An E/e value over 13.80 represents a simple, yet effective instrument for assessing the HFR risk. However, all-cause mortality at six months is not influenced by the E/e ratio.","output":"The E/e RatioRole in Risk Stratification of Acute Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing pandemic It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infects the host through the cell surface receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in multiple organs, and in the arterial and venous endothelial cells We have recently proposed the use of the term MicroCLOTS ( Microvascular COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thromboinflammatory syndrome) to describe the unique type of ARDS seen in patients affected by SARS-COV-2 After a multidisciplinary assessment of more than 850 COVID-19 patients admitted to our Hospital with several bilateral pneumonia, we have collected evidences supporting a key role of vascular inflammation and microthrombosis in the pathophysiology of the multisystemic clinical manifestations that have been associated with COVID-19 There is now a general consensus on the recommendation of anticoagulation in patient with severe SARS-Cov2 infections, although the dose of the prophylaxis and even the choice between a prophylactic and a treatment regimen remains controversial Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to help clarifying the many therapeutic challenges associated with the management of SARS-Cov-2 patients","output":"MicroCLOTS pathophysiology in COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a major challenge for public health.

However, the dynamics of viral infection, replication and shedding are poorly understood. Here, we show that Rhesus macaques are susceptible to the infection by SARS-CoV-2. After intratracheal inoculation, the first peak of viral RNA was observed in oropharyngeal swabs one day post infection (1 d.p.i.), mainly from the input of the inoculation, while the second peak occurred at 5 d.p.i., which reflected on-site replication in the respiratory tract. Histopathological observation shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause interstitial pneumonia in animals, characterized by hyperemia and edema, and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes in alveoli. We also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract tissues, including trachea, bronchus and lung; and viruses were also re-isolated from oropharyngeal swabs, bronchus and lung, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies generated from the primary infection could protect the Rhesus macaques from a second-round challenge by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: We used an online platform with four guests, a moderator and about 100 attendees. During the event we gathered demographic facts through an interactive questionnaire tool and an extensive evaluation afterwards. Results: The event was rated with an overall grade of 1.4 (Likert from 1 to 6, 1 best grade; SD 0.5) and participants agreed that this format should be organized again (1.2; SD 0.5). 70% of audience members preferred the online format of the event.

Conclusion: Firstly, most participants preferred the event to be online, contrary to our expectation. Secondly, the handling of the amount of individual questions posed significant challenges. Finally, the number of attendees and questions suggested a continuing demand among students and physicians for further education regarding hospital management, especially regarding COVID-19.

The impact of these surgical delays on survival for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 37 730 patients in the National Cancer Database with HNSCC who underwent primary surgical management from 2004 to 2016 was performed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of overall survival. Bootstrapping methods were used to identify optimal time-to-surgery (TTS) thresholds at which overall survival differences were greatest. Cox proportional hazard models with or without restricted cubic splines were used to determine the association between TTS and survival. RESULTS: The study identified TTS as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS). Bootstrapping the data to dichotomize the cohort identified the largest rise in hazard ratio (HR) at day 67, which was used as the optimal TTS cut-point in survival analysis. The patients who underwent surgical treatment longer than 67 days after diagnosis had a significantly increased risk of death (HR, 1.189; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.122C1.261; P < 0.0001). For every 30-day delay in TTS, the hazard of death increased by 4.6%. Subsite analysis showed that the oropharynx subsite was most affected by surgical delays, followed by the oral cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing TTS is an independent predictor of survival for patients with HNSCC and should be performed within 67 days after diagnosis to achieve optimal survival outcomes.

Tumor angiogenesis is related to vascular invasion and metastasis. However, anti-angiogenesis therapeutic effects in PDAC are limited. Therefore, it is imperative to explore molecular mechanism of angiogenesis in PDAC. Experimental Design: scRNA-seq data were utilized to delineatetranscriptional profiles of endothelial cells in PDAC. The in vitro and vivo angiogenesis models were used to explore the role of PDAC derived exosomes under hypoxic condition in tumor angiogenesis. Results: Endothelial cells in PDAC had distinct gene expression profiles compared with normal pancreas. The marker genes of endothelial cells in PDAC were enriched for hypoxia and angiogenesis. MiR-30b-5p were significantly enriched in hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomes, which could be transferred to HUVEC, resulting in the upregulation of miR-30b-5p. Hypoxic PDAC cells derived exosomes could promote tube formation and endothelial cells migration via miR-30b-5p mediated downregulation of gap junction protein GJA1.

It is believed to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus cell fusion and glycosylation of viral surface proteins. In addition to its antiviral activity, hydroxychloroquine has an immune-modulating activity that may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo, making it a potentially promising drug for the prevention and the cure of SARS-CoV-19. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether it can be used safely to treat COVID-19 patients or to prevent infection. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for (I) the prevention of COVID-19 or related symptoms in SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, such as as household members/contacts of COVID-19 patients and (II) the treatment of early-phase asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a controlled, open label, cluster-randomized, superiority trial with parallel group design. Subjects will be randomized either to receive hydroxychloroquine or to observation (2:1). PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects, including household members and/or contacts of COVID-19 patients and healthcare professionals (Group 1) or patients with COVID-19 (positive PCR test on a rhinopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic in home situations who are not undergoing treatment with any anti COVID-19 medication (Group 2), will be enrolled. Paucisymptomatic patients are defined as patients with a low number of mild symptoms. All subjects must be aged 18 years, male or female, must be willing and able to give informed consent and must not have any contraindications to take hydroxychloroquine (intolerance or previous toxicity for hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, bradycardia or reduction in heart rhythm with arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, retinopathy, congestive heart failure with use of diuretics, favism or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, diabetes type 1, major comorbidities such as advanced chronic kidney disease or dialysis therapy, known history of ventricular arrhythmia, any oncologic/hematologic malignancy, severe neurological and mental illness, current use of medications with known significant drug-drug interactions, and known prolonged QT syndrome or current use of drugs with known QT prolongation). The study is monocentric and will be conducted at Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS. Subjects will be enrolled from a large epidemic region (North-Central Italy). The Public Health Departments of several Italian regions will collaborate by identifying potentially eligible subjects. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The participants will be randomized (2:1 randomization) to receive either hydroxychloroquine (Arm A) or to Observation (Arm B). Hydroxychloroquine will be administered with the following schedule: Group1: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by a weekly dose of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily on days 8, 15 and 22, for a total of one month of treatment. Group 2: A loading dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg twice daily for a total of 5-7 days. The comparator in this trial is observation given that currently neither treatment is administered to asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects, nor prophylaxis is available for contacts. Hydroxychloroquine will be shipped to subjects within 24 hours of randomization. Given the extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, only telephonic interviews will be carried out and electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) completed. During treatment, each subject will be contacted every other day for the first week and weekly thereafter (Group 2) or weekly (Group 1) by a study physician to assess early onset of any COVID-19 symptom or any adverse reaction to hydroxychloroquine and to check subject compliance. Furthermore, all subjects will receive periodic ePROs which may be completed through smartphone or tablets to record drug self-administration and onset of any symptom or adverse event. All subjects will be followed up for a total of 6 months by periodic telephonic interviews and ePROs. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint/outcome measure for this trial is: for Group 1, the proportion of subjects who become symptomatic and/or swab-positive in each arm within one month of randomization; for Group 2, the proportion of subjects who become swab-negative in each arm within 14 days of randomization. RANDOMIZATION: All household members and/or contacts of each COVID-19 index case, and the COVID-19 patient himself/herself, fulfilling all inclusion criteria will be grouped into a single cluster and this cluster will be randomized (2:1) to either arm A or arm B. Information on each subject will be recorded in specific data records. Randomization lists will be stratified according to the following factors regarding COVID-19 index cases: 1. COVID-19 risk level on the basis of province of residence (high vs. low/intermediate); 2. Index case is a healthcare professional (yes vs.no) 3. Index case with COVID-19 treatment (yes vs. no) An independent statistician not otherwise involved in the trial will generate the allocation sequence, and COVID-19 response teams will be unaware of the allocation of clusters.

Assuming around 1.5-2.0 asymptomatic household members and/or contacts for each COVID-19 patient, we expect to identify approximately 1000-1300 COVID-19 index cases to be randomized. An interim analysis on efficacy is planned using standard alpha-spending function. For Group 2, sufficient power for primary objective (negative swab within 14 days of randomization) will be reached given a sample size of 300 asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 subjects in home situations not treated for COVID-19 (25%-30% of about 1000-1300 expected index cases). Since up to date reduced evidence about COVID-19 infection epidemiology, the continuous update of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, the sample size estimation could be updated after a one third of population will be recruited and eventually modified according to a substantial protocol amendment. An interim analysis at 100 enrolled COVID-19 patients is planned. We have planned a Generalized Estimating Equation analysis, which is more efficient than a cluster level analysis, to take advantage of subject-specific covariates. The above reported sample size analysis is therefore to be considered conservative. TRIAL STATUS: The current version of the PROTECT trial protocol is Final version, 15 April 2020. The study started on 9(th) May 2020. The first patient was enrolled on 14(th) May 2020. Recruitment is expected to last through September 2020.

Polymorbidity increases the risk of death, especially during a pandemic. Patients with multiple chronic diseases are the most vulnerable part of the population. Mortality among this group during the period of self-isolation has not been studied. AIM: To study the structure of mortality not caused by coronavirus infection, in patients with polymorbid pathology during the period of self-isolation (lockdown). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outpatient records of 2,423 patients with polymorbid pathology (841 males and 1,582 females, aged from 18 to 99 years) were examined. The mortality and its causes during three years including a period of lockdown were investigated. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate among patients with polymorbid pathology was 10.2% without differences in gender. The structure of the causes of death in patients with polymorbidity: cardiovascular diseases accounted for 50.8%, oncological diseases  21%, nervous system diseases  7.3%. During the lockdown, an increase in overall mortality by 34.3% was recorded (p < 0.05), with an increase in the number of deaths of patients with cardiovascular diseases by 19.5% (p > 0.05) (mostly patients with ischemic heart disease). CONCLUSION: An increase in the number of deceased patients with polymorbidity during the lockdown may be due to the limitation of physical activity, of the possibility of examination and consultation by profile specialists. Taking into account the vulnerability of this group of patients, there is an urgent need to develop preventive measures when the situation recurs. ? 2021, Eco-Vector LLC.

Additionally, a decrease in motor performance has been increasingly reported; however, there is a lack of meaningful data on the relationship between these findings and socioeconomic status. Therefore, we examined the BMI, BMI z score, the prevalence of overweight/obesity, and motor performance (based on lateral jumping, the standing long jump, and the 6-min run) among three cohorts from timelines before (2016) and during the pandemic (2020, 2021), using a cohort sequential design. Our analysis revealed that all parameters examined showed a significant negative trend over time. For children with a low social burden, the trend was statistically detectable only for lateral jumping and the 6-min run. For children with a high social burden, the prevalence of overweight/obesity increased from 4.2% to 5.4% between 2016 and 2021. The prevalence of being underweight also increased from 3.4% to 4.3% during this time. Motor performance decreased from 11.3% to 12.3%, except in the standing long jump. Children with a high social burden showed significantly lower results (7.4% to 9.6%). Thus, our data confirm an increase in both measurements of overweight/obesity and underweight, as well as a decrease in motor performance under the pandemic conditions, especially in children from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds.

Metabolomics is an emerging method which intends to explore the global alterations of various metabolites in samples. We aimed to identify metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as biomarkers that were potentially unique for neurobrucellosis. CSF samples from 25 neurobrucellosis patients and 25 normal controls (uninfected patients with hydrocephalus) were collected for metabolite detection using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Inflammatory cytokines in CSF were measured with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The base peak chromatogram in CSF samples showed that small-molecule metabolites were well separated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis exhibited the examined samples were arranged in two main clusters in accordance with their group. Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) revealed there was a noticeable separation between neurobrucellosis and normal groups. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) could responsibly illuminate the differences between neurobrucellosis and normal controls. Neurobrucellosis showed a total of 155 differentiated metabolites. Prominent potential biomarkers including 30 metabolites were then selected out, regarded as more capable of distinguishing neurobrucellosis. TNF- and IL-6 in CSF were remarkably increased in neurobrucellosis. We presented the heatmaps and correlation analyses among the identified 30 potential biomarkers. In conclusion, this study showed that CSF metabolomics based on LC-MS could distinguish neurobrucellosis patients from normal controls.

The production of smoke as a result of vaporization of surgical tissue is inevitable, and exposure to surgical smoke is a long-standing concern. These vapours are potentially hazardous to patients and surgical teams. The present research was designed to compare various surgical devices to determine whether viable cells exist in their surgical smoke. METHODS The search for viable cells in surgical smoke was conducted using both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Various cancers were cauterized with electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation and ultrasonic scalpels, and the resulting surgical smoke was aspirated with Transwell(?) membrane; viable cells were sought in the surgical smoke. In an in vivo experiment, samples of SCC7 were cauterized with an ultrasonic scalpel and the sediment from the rinsed Transwell(?) membrane liquid after centrifugation was injected subcutaneously into the lower back of mice. RESULTS Viable cells were found only in the smoke from ultrasonic scalpels (in all 25 samples taken 5 cm from the cautery; 2 of 25 samples at 10 cm). Viable cells in the surgical smoke from ultrasonic scalpels implanted in mice grew in 16 of 40 injection sites. Histological and biochemical analyses revealed that these cancer cells were identical to the cancer cells cauterized by the ultrasonic scalpel. CONCLUSION Viable tumour cells are produced in the surgical smoke from tumour dissection by ultrasonic scalpel. Surgical relevance Surgical smoke is a byproduct of dissection using a number of powered devices. Hazards to operating room personnel and patients are unclear. This study has shown that use of an ultrasonic dissection device can produce smoke that contains viable tumour cells. Although the model is somewhat artificial, a theoretical risk exists, and measures to evacuate surgical smoke efficiently are important.","output":"Experimental study of the potential hazards of surgical smoke from powered instruments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"3CL proteases (3CLpro) are only found in RNA viruses and have a central role in polyprotein processing during replication.

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, an increased avoidance of the emergency departments for non-COVID-19 illnesses has been reported in the medical literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period. STUDY DESIGN: A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n = 68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p = 0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p = 0.007), respectively. A higher proportion of patients waited over 24 h to present to emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (47% vs 8.8%, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic a significantly higher rates of orchiectomies and increase in delayed presentations for testicular torsion was found.

The thermodynamic stability test was carried out with phase separation parameters followed by the robustness to dilution and accelerated stability test. The immunostimulant activity was examined in vitro and in vivo by determining the phagocytic activity, cell proliferation, production of nitrite oxide levels of RAW 264.7 cells, phagocytic activity of macrophages, and the number of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The formula optimization showed that the formula containing Capryol-90, Cremophor RH40, and PEG 400 at a ratio of 30: 34: 36 was optimum. The verification response of the optimum formula with drug loading showed that the transmittance, droplet size, and zeta potential were 96.90  0.00%, 28.7  1.20 nm, and ?56.5  2.05 mV, respectively.

Summary: The etiology of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 appears multifactorial. Systemic effects of sepsis, inflammation, and vascular injury likely play some role. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, highly expressed in the kidney, providing a route for direct infection. Older age, baseline comorbidities, and respiratory failure are strong risk factors for the development of AKI. Regardless of etiology, AKI carries a significantly increased risk for in-hospital mortality, especially in those with critical illness. Currently, management of AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains supportive. Key Messages: AKI is common in patients with COVID-19.

It is based on two-dimensional, black and white imaging, and is used to detect regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). In the last five years much has changed and RWMA is not enough on its own to stratify patient risk and dictate therapy. Patients arriving at SE labs often have comorbidities and are undergoing full anti-ischemic therapy. The SE positivity rate based on RWMA fell from 70% in the eighties to 10% in the last decade. The understanding of CAD pathophysiology has shifted from a regional hydraulic disease to a systemic biologic disease. The conventional view of CAD encouraged the use of coronary anatomic imaging for diagnosis and the oculo-stenotic reflex for the deployment of therapy. This has led to a clinical oversimplification that ignores the lessons of pathophysiology and epidemiology, and in fact, CAD is not synonymous with ischemic heart disease. Patients with CAD may also have other vulnerabilities such as coronary plaque (step A of ABCDE-SE), alveolar-capillary membrane and pulmonary congestion (step B), preload and contractile reserve (step C), coronary microcirculation (step D) and cardiac autonomic balance (step E).

Results: : The average age of the patients was 46.0  15 (range: 1-74) years. Of the 118 patients, 62 are male (52.5%) and 56 are female (47.5%). Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9-41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein(CRP) levels , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0-5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0-20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the areas most likely to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%);common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0-5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0-20). The residual lesions mainly presented as ground glass opacities (61.0%), and the main accompanying sign was linear opacities (59.3%). Based on chest CT, the median maximum PII of lungs was 30.0% (range: 0-97.5%), and the median PII after discharge in the patients excluding the two deaths was 12.5% (range: 0-53.0%). PII was significantly negatively correlated with the LYM count and significantly positively correlated with body temperature, LDH, CRP, and ESR. There was no significant correlation between the PII and the white blood cell count, but the grade of PII correlated well with the clinical classification. Conclusion: PII can be used to monitor the severity and the treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia, provide help for clinical classification, assist in treatment plan adjustments and aid assessments for discharge.","output":"The role of chest CT quantitative pulmonary inflammatory index in the evaluation of the course and treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with hypertension control among treated middle-aged UK adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study including 99 468 previously diagnosed, treated hypertensives enrolled in the UK Biobank. Hypertension control was defined as systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. RESULTS: Median age was 62.3 years (IQR 57.3 to 66.0), 45.9% female, 92.0% white, 40.1% obese, 9.3% current smokers and 19.4% had prior cardiovascular disease. 38.1% (95% CI 37.8% to 38.4%) were controlled. In multivariable logistic regression, associations with lack of hypertension control included: older age (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.64 for 60C69 years compared with age 40C50 years), higher alcohol use (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.64, for consuming >30 units per week compared with none), black ethnicity (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.82 compared with white), obesity (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.76 compared with normal body mass index).

With the involvement of COVID-19, the prevalence of cardiovascular manifestation has increased. The precise processes of extrapulmonary and systemic manifestations following COVID-19 are unknown. There is an elevated risk of cardiovascular harm, notably myocardial infraction followed by acute infection. Conclusion It is essential to understand the mechanism of potential cardiac complications and to keep the patient on close watch, especially if the patient has risk factors such as diabetes mellitus.","output":"Late onset ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patient with COVID-19: A case report from Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the effect of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine rotavirus (BRoV), and Cryptosporidiumparvum on dairy calf health and performance and to determine the prevalence of these pathogens. A total of 198 male dairy calves housed at a grain-fed veal facility were examined from June 11, 2018, to October 9, 2018. Calves were fed milk replacer twice daily and housed individually until weaning at 56 d. Once weaned, calves were moved into groups of 5 until they were moved to a finishing facility at 77 d. At the grain-fed veal facility, calves were scored for fecal consistency for the first 28 d and had fecal samples taken on arrival and at 7 and 14 d. Fecal samples were frozen and submitted to a commercial laboratory, where they were tested for BCoV, C.parvum, and 2 groups of BRoV: group A (BRoV A) and group B (BRoV B). Calves were weighed on arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 77 d using a digital body scale. Treatments for disease and mortalities that occurred over the 77 d were also recorded. Statistical models, including Cox proportional hazards and repeated measures models, were built to determine the effect of infection with 1 of the pathogens. Over the 3 sampling points, 151 (85.8%), 178 (94.2%), 3 (1.5%), and 97 (57.4%) calves tested positive at least once for BCoV, BRoV A, BRoV B, and C.parvum, respectively. The source of the calves and the level of serum total protein measured on arrival were associated with testing positive for a pathogen. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea and severe diarrhea; calves that tested positive for BCoV and BRoV A had an increased proportion of days with severe diarrhea. In addition, calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a higher hazard of being treated for respiratory disease. With respect to body weight, calves that had diarrhea or severe diarrhea had lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d. Specifically, calves that had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea showed a reduction in weight gain of up to 15 kg compared to calves without diarrhea. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d; calves that tested positive for BCoV had a lower body weight at 56 and 77 d. This study demonstrates that the prevalence of BCoV, BRoV A, and C.parvum infection is high in this population of calves and has significant effects on the occurrence of diarrhea and body weight gain. Future studies should evaluate approaches for minimizing the effect of infection with these pathogens to improve the welfare, health, and productivity of dairy calves.","output":"The effect of Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus infection on the health and performance of male dairy calves."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressed patients, including individuals with organ transplantation, have been among susceptible groups with regard to COVID-19, on the other hand pediatric patients more commonly undergo a mild clinical course after acquiring COVID-19.

There are four variants of Kaposi sarcoma with characteristic presentation namely: classic, endemic, iatrogenic and epidemic/AIDS related. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as lesions involving mucocutaneous regions however visceral organs and lymph nodes may be involved too. Osseous involvement with Kaposi is rare. We present a rare case of HIV-AIDS related KS with metastasis to bone and lungs. Case Description: A 38-year-old male with a history of HIV on Highly active antiretroviral (HAART) therapy, CD4 count of 140 and undetectable viral load presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of right-sided colicky abdominal pain due to a non-obstructing right mid ureteral calculus 2mm without hydronephrosis. Medical history was significant for cutaneous biopsy-proven Kaposi Sarcoma for which the patient was being treated with doxorubicin. Computed Tomography (CT) Pelvis done for abdominal pain revealed osseous lucencies in pelvis which was further defined via MRI as metastatic lesions involving lumbar spine, pelvis, sacrum, and bilateral femurs. Chest x ray revealed bilateral opacities. CT-Chest revealed diffuse bronchial wall thickening with peri-broncho-vascular nodularity and mass like consolidation at the central right middle lobe. Viral panel including COVID and sputum culture were negative. He underwent bronchoscopy which showed multiple areas of red macular lesions on bilateral airways involving the carina of LUL-lingula, superior segment of left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. BAL was negative for opportunistic infection. Biopsy of the pulmonary lesions was deferred given highly vascular nature of suspected Kaposi sarcoma, with plans to have bone biopsy in the future. However, given the metastatic bone lesions and presence of lung lesions consistent phenotypically with Kaposi, patient was diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma with pulmonary and bony metastasis. Treatment with doxorubicin was continued with plans to follow up outpatient. Discussion: Kaposi sarcoma is an angioproliferative mesenchymal neoplasm which is the most common AIDS-Defining malignancy. KS usually involves skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and spleen, rarely bone or skeletal muscles. Osseous KS lesions are thought to be associated with long-standing and locally aggressive cutaneous African and Classic KS lesions, or with AIDS-associated mucosal KS lesions that penetrate underlying bone. Osseous KS portends poor prognosis. Treatment is usually HAART with chemotherapy. This case highlights an unusual presentation of Kaposi sarcoma with bony involvement in a patient on HAART.","output":"Kaposi Sarcoma: A Rare Presentation with Pulmonary and Osseous Involvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain of Coronavirus that spreads primarily by close contact. Although Nigeria adopted lockdown measures, no defined strategies were used in setting the distance threshold for these lockdowns. Hence, understanding the drivers of COVID-19 is pivotal to an informed decision for containment measures in the absence of vaccines. Spatial and temporal analyses are crucial drivers to apprehending the pattern of diseases over space and time. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the significance of distance to the temporal dynamics of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using the Geographic Information System. Incremental spatial autocorrelation was used to analyze datasets of each month in ArcGIS. March, April, May, and June exhibited patterns with no significant peaks, while July and August exhibited patterns with two statistically significant peaks. The first and second peaks of July were 301,338.39 and 365,947.83 meters, respectively, while August was 301,338.39 and 336,128.09 meters, respectively. Therefore, a significant difference in the clustering of COVID-19 over distances between July and August was established. This indicated that progression in the spread of the virus increased the virus's spatial coverage while the distance of risk of exposure decreased. This study's findings could be utilized to establish maximum movement restriction areas to contain the spread of COVID-19.

This article will discuss scientific papers published primarily since June 2002 that have introduced new concepts in how chemokines regulate the inflammatory response to specific viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Acute respiratory viruses commonly induce inflammatory chemokines such as CCL3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha) and CCL5 (RANTES), which can amplify inflammatory responses leading to immunopathology. Where single agent therapy fails, combination antiviral and anti-CCL3 treatment is synergistic and able to prevent mortality in mice infected with the highly lethal pneumonia virus of mice. Human herpesvirus-6 also induces production of CCL3 and CCL5, which are able to block HIV-1 replication in coinfected human lymphoid tissue. On this basis, Margolis has proposed a new and general approach to the treatment and prevention of infection by viral pathogens. SUMMARY Inflammatory chemokines play both beneficial and harmful roles in infectious diseases caused by viruses. Blocking them or using them as immunomodulators, depending on the virus, may be rational approaches to treatment or prevention of disease. With regard to blockade, combination antiviral/antichemokine therapy is a new strategy worth considering as a general therapeutic approach to viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). With regard to immunomodulation, use of weak or attenuated viruses to skew the local cytokine network to a configuration able to inhibit a pathogen is a new and interesting concept, but is fraught with important safety issues. Identifying master chemokines to target or exploit in human viral infection is a major opportunity and challenge for clinical immunologists.","output":"Chemokine regulation of inflammation during acute viral infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is uncertainty on the risk of dying after coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in chronic liver disease patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We explored the outcomes of all Covid-19 adult inpatients in France, in 2020. We computed adjusted odds-ratios to measure the associations between chronic liver disease, alcohol use disorders, mechanical ventilation and day-30, in-hospital, mortality. RESULTS: The sample comprised 259,110 patients [median (interquartile range) age 70 (54, 83) years; 52% men], including 15,746 (6.0%) and 10,006 (3.9%) patients with chronic liver disease and alcohol use disorders, respectively. Mortality was 38,203 (15%) patients, including 7,475 (28%) after mechanical ventilation, and 2,941 (19%) with chronic liver disease. The adjusted odds-ratios for mechanical ventilation and day-30 mortality were 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.44 - 1.64, P < 0.001) and 1.79 (1.71 - 1.87, P < 0.001); 0.55 (0.47 - 0.64, P < 0.001) and 0.54 (0.48 - 0.61, P < 0.001); 0.64 (0.53 - 0.76; P < 0.001) and 0.71 (0.63- 0.80, P < 0.001); 0.65 (0.52 - 0.81, P < 0.001) and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.94 - 2.51, P < 0.001); 0.34 (0.24 - 0.50; P < 0.001) and 1.38 (1.17 - 1.62, P < 0.001); and 0.82 (0.76 - 0.89; P < 0.001) and 1.11 (1.05 - 1.17; P < 0.001) for chronic liver disease; mild liver disease; compensated cirrhosis; decompensated cirrhosis; primary liver cancer; and alcohol use disorders, respectively. Chronic viral hepatitis; non-viral, non-alcoholic chronic hepatitis; organ, including liver, transplantation, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were not associated with Covid-19 death. CONCLUSION: Chronic liver disease increased the risk Covid-19 death in France in 2020. Therapeutic effort limitation may have contributed to Covid-19 death of patients with a liver-related complication or with alcohol use disorders. LAY SUMMARY: We studied the outcomes, including mechanical ventilation and day-30 mortality, of all Covid-19 adults (N=259,110) discharged from acute and post-acute care, private and public hospitals, in France in 2020. Patients with mild liver disease; compensated cirrhosis; organ, including liver, transplantation; or acquired immunodepression syndrome were not at risk for Covid-19 mortality. Patients with alcohol use disorders; decompensated cirrhosis; or primary liver cancer were at high, positive, risk for Covid-19 mortality and at low, negative, risk for mechanical ventilation. Our results suggest that a limitation of the therapeutic effort may have contributed to the excess of mortality of patients with a liver-related complication and of patients with alcohol use disorders in France in 2020.","output":"Prognosis of French COVID-19 patients with chronic liver disease: a national retrospective cohort study for 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atomically-thin two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure, an emerging class of nanomaterials, has achieved tremendous progress in the past decade and will remain a significant research topic in the near future Apart from the discoveries of various 2D nanomaterials, remarkable attentions have been paid to the rational design and alteration of architectures based on pristine 2D materials to meet demands of next-generation functional applications in the near term Herein, this review intends to provide an instant survey over the recent key advances on the structural engineering strategies of 2D nanomaterial-based architectures for new sensing capabilities and opportunities Through intrinsic or extrinsic alterations, the pristine 2D nanostructures of some unique intrinsic properties could be modified and functionalized in a predictable pattern to overcome existing drawbacks and obtain synergistic abilities, demonstrating a great potential in promoting sensing device performance In parallel with the review of latest development of structural engineering strategies and related highly functionalized sensor devices including sensing capabilities towards Covid-19 antigens, the underlying mechanisms of these designs are revealed to offer a unique insight in understandings of architecture design and property tailoring for boosting new sensing capabilities and performances","output":"Tailoring Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials by Structural Engineering for Chemical and Biological Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As a harm reduction-focused primary care clinic for people who use drugs, the Respectful and Equitable Access to Comprehensive Healthcare (REACH) Program faced multiple barriers due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, wearing masks to prevent the spread of viruses such as COVID-19 involves obscuring a large portion of the face. Do the eyes carry sufficient information to allow for the accurate perception of emotions in dynamic expressions obscured by masks? What about the perception of the meanings of specific smiles? We addressed these questions in two studies. In the first, participants saw dynamic expressions of happiness, disgust, anger, and surprise that were covered by N95, surgical, or cloth masks or were uncovered and rated the extent to which the expressions conveyed each of the same four emotions. Across conditions, participants perceived significantly lower levels of the expressed (target) emotion in masked faces, and this was particularly true for expressions composed of more facial action in the lower part of the face. Higher levels of other (non-target) emotions were also perceived in masked expressions. In the second study, participants rated the extent to which three categories of smiles (reward, affiliation, and dominance) conveyed positive feelings, reassurance, and superiority, respectively. Masked smiles communicated less of the target signal than unmasked smiles, but not more of other possible signals. The present work extends recent studies of the effects of masked faces on the perception of emotion in its novel use of dynamic facial expressions (as opposed to still images) and the investigation of different types of smiles.

It is the first study applied to the Jordanian population. The aim was to investigate how quarantine for several weeks changed the students' habits and affected their mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a random representative sample of 6,157 undergraduate students (mean age 19.79  1.67 years, males 28.7%) from the University of Jordan through voluntarily filling an online questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) were used to assess sleep quality and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results: The PSQI mean score for the study participants was 8.1  3.6. The sleep quality of three-quarters of the participants was negatively affected by the extended quarantine. Nearly half of the participants reported poor sleep quality. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among participants was 76% (males: 71.5% and females: 77.8%). Similarly, the prevalence of the depressive symptoms was 71% (34% for moderate and 37% for high depressive symptoms), with females showing higher prevalence than males. The overall mean CES-D score for the group with low depressive symptoms is 9.3, for the moderate group is 19.8, while it is 34.3 for the high depressive symptoms group. More than half of the students (62.5%) reported that the quarantine had a negative effect on their mental health. Finally, females, smokers, and students with decreased income levels during the extended quarantine were the common exposures that are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Mass and extended quarantine succeeded in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus; however, it comes with a high cost of potential psychological impacts. Most of the students reported that they suffer from sleeping disorders and had a degree of depressive symptoms. Officials should provide psychological support and clear guidance to help the general public to reduce these potential effects and overcome the quarantine period with minimum negative impacts.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 Quarantine on the Sleep Quality and the Depressive Symptom Levels of University Students in Jordan During the Spring of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mutations in the splicing factor pre-messenger RNA processing factor 31 (PRPF31) gene cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa 11 (RP11) through a haplo-insufficiency mechanism. We describe the phenotype and progression of microperimetry and autofluorescence endpoints in an Indigenous Australian RP11 family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ophthalmic examination, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence and microperimetry were performed at baseline and every 6-12 months. Baseline and annual change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry mean sensitivity (MS) and number of scotoma loci, residual ellipsoid zone (EZ) span and hyperautofluorescent ring (HAR) area were reported. Next-generation and Sanger sequencing were performed in available members. RESULTS: 12 affected members from three generations were examined. Mean (SD, range) age at onset of symptoms was 11 (4.5, 4-19) years. MS declined steadily from the third decade and EZ span and HAR area declined rapidly during the second decade. Serial microperimetry showed negligible change in MS over 2-3 years. However, mean EZ span, near-infrared and short-wavelength HAR area reduction was 203 (6.4%) m/year, 1.8 (8.7%) mm2/year and 1.1 (8.6%) mm2/year, respectively. Genetic testing was performed on 11 affected and 10 asymptomatic members and PRPF31 c.1205 C > A (p.Ser402Ter) mutation was detected in all affected and two asymptomatic members (non-penetrant carriers). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that in the studied cohort, the optimal window for therapeutic intervention is the second decade of life and residual EZ span and HAR area can be considered as efficacy outcome measures. Further studies on larger samples with different PRPF31 mutations and longer follow-up duration are recommended.","output":"Exploring microperimetry and autofluorescence endpoints for monitoring disease progression in PRPF31-associated retinopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with an unusual enteric tropism (CalEnt) was isolated from a California broiler flock exhibiting runting-stunting syndrome. IBV was detected in the small intestine, but not in the respiratory tract or kidney. During virus isolation in embryos, it did not replicate in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) but could be recovered from intestines. Its S1 protein showed 93% amino acid sequence identity to a California variant isolated in 1999 (Cal99). Intestinal lesions were reproduced following ocular/nasal inoculation of specific-pathogen-free chickens, but respiratory signs and lesions were also present. The virus was detected in both respiratory and intestinal tissues. To determine whether the novel tropism of IBV CalEnt was due to an increased ability of its S1 protein to bind to the intestinal epithelium, we compared the binding of soluble trimeric recombinant S1 proteins derived from CalEnt and Cal99 to chicken tissues. Contrary to expectations, the CalEnt S1 protein did not bind to small intestine and, unlike Cal99 S1, did not bind to the respiratory epithelium or CAM. Using only the CalEnt S1 N-terminal domain or including the S2 ectodomain (lacking membrane and cytoplasmic domains), which have been shown to improve ArkDPI S1 protein binding, did not lead to detectable binding at the standard protein concentration to any tissue tested. Our results indicate no/poor binding of the CalEnt spike protein to both respiratory and intestinal tissues and thus do not support better attachment to intestinal epithelial cells as a reason for CalEnt's extended tropism. These results might reflect shortcomings of the assay, including that it does not detect potential contributions of the S1 C-terminal domain to attachment. We used bioinformatic approaches to explore the possibility that the unique tropism of CalEnt might be a result of functions of the S protein in cell-entry steps subsequent to attachment. These analyses suggest that CalEnt's S2 coding region was acquired through a recombination event and encodes a unique amino acid sequence at the putative recognition site for the protease that activates the S protein for fusion. Thus, S2 activation by tissue-specific proteases might facilitate CalEnt entry into intestinal epithelial cells and compensate for poor binding by its S1 protein.","output":"Intestinal Tropism of an Infectious Bronchitis Virus Isolate Not Explained by Spike Protein Binding Specificity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies exacted a large economic toll on large portions of the United States population. For older and disabled workers, the effects could be more persistent and fiscally costly than the impacts experienced by young, healthy workers due to the spillovers onto Social Security. We use Current Population Survey, Social Security administrative data on applications for retirement and disability benefits, and Google Trends data to assess the impact of COVID-19 on older adults age 50-70. We find that employment for this group dropped substantially more than would have been predicted prior to the pandemic: employment for 50-61 year olds was 5.7 pp (8.3 percent) lower, while employment for 62-70-year- olds was 3.9 pp (10.7 percent) lower. For people aged 50-61, unemployment and labor force exits due to reasons other than disability and retirement represented 63 and 30 percent of the employment decline, respectively. For those aged 62-70, the two largest components of the reduction were unemployment (50 percent) and retirement-driven labor force exits (30 percent). We find evidence of declines in reporting a labor force exit due to disability (4-5 percent), applications for disability insurance (15 percent), and Google search intensity for disability (7 percent).

Many CYP struggle to swallow pills and the prospect of changing from suspensions to tablets induces anxiety.Pill swallowing training was originally run by specialist nurses or play staff in hospital. This service was disrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic with the majority of non-urgent care being delivered remotely by telephone or video link. We devised an online module to teach young people how to swallow pills. In addition, we trialled the use of YP volunteers as peer-to-peer trainers.ObjectivesTo evaluate the feasibility of delivering pill swallowing teaching to YP via video-link/onlineTo evaluate the feasibility of young people as peer-educatorsMethods10 young people were recruited and completed training on an evidence-based pill swallowing technique. Once trained, volunteers were provided with electronic resources and attempted to teach a convenience sample of their peers how to swallow pills using the same technique. Teaching was delivered on a 1:1 basis and excluded any participants with oro-motor difficulties. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires were administered, including a validated questionnaire (Pill-5) assessing respondents ability and anxiety related to pill swallowing. Data analysis included qualitative input from the YP volunteers.Results54 YP received the teaching. Median age was 15 years (11 C 18 years). Baseline data showed that while 64% (35/54) almost never had physical difficulties swallowing pills (e.g. getting stuck) 69% (38/54) reported some fear of swallowing pills.We had a 62% (34/54) respondent rate for post-intervention data. Reductions of negative indicators on the validated questionnaire were seen in all domains but most were not statistically significant. We did find a significant reduction in fear surrounding pill swallowing (39%, p = 0.017).YP told us the module was super helpful, (I) feel a lot more confident now and Ive been able to swallow some pills which I couldnt before. Thank you!. They reported the teaching materials were appropriate, easy to understand and do and had no objections to the online delivery.ConclusionsOur results indicate that using YP to teach pill swallowing using a live, online mode of delivery is feasible and well-received. We attribute most of the non-significant findings to the fact the study population was a convenience sample to pilot the mode of delivery, rather than being a targeted population of CYP who find pill swallowing a challenge. Nonetheless, our data indicates that even amongst YP who can swallow pills, there remains a high frequency of anxiety.A single session giving YP structured instructions and practise at swallowing pills was associated with significantly reducing this anxiety. Further work should evaluate the impact of this intervention in larger, targeted groups. Peer-to-peer training gives this the potential to be used in schools and social settings as a pre-emptory model to improve childrens ability to swallow pills.","output":"Young persons peer-to-peer pill swallowing training via video-link.

OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in five cities with varying COVID-19 incidence in the US, UK, and Australia. DESIGN: Online, cross-sectional survey of adults from Dynatas research panel in July-September 2020 PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Adults aged 18 and over in Sydney, Melbourne, London, New York City, or Phoenix MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; reason for vaccine intention STATISTICAL METHODS: To identify predictors of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, we used Poisson regression with robust error estimation to produce prevalence ratios. RESULTS: The proportion willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was 70% in London, 71% NYC, 72% in Sydney, 76% in Phoenix, and 78% in Melbourne. Age was the only sociodemographic characteristic that predicted willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in all five cities. In Sydney and Melbourne, participants with high confidence in their current government had greater willingness to receive the vaccine (PR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.07-1.44 and PR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.74-1.62), while participants with high confidence in their current government in NYC and Phoenix were less likely to be willing to receive the vaccine (PR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72 - 0.85 and PR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.76-0.96). LIMITATIONS: Consumer panels can be subject to bias and may not be representative of the general population CONCLUSIONS: Success for COVID-19 vaccination programs requires high levels of vaccine acceptance. Our data suggests more than 25% of adults may not be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but many of them were not explicitly anti-vaccination and thus may become more willing to vaccinate over time. Among the three countries surveyed, there appears to be cultural differences, political influences, and differing experiences with COVID-19 that may affect willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Trust in government, intention to vaccinate and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: a comparative survey of five large cities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on peoples mental health.

We randomized patients to early nephrologist follow-up (standardized basket of care that emphasized blood pressure control, cardiovascular risk reduction, and medication safety) or usual care from July 2015 to June 2017. Feasibility outcomes included the proportion of eligible patients enrolled, seen by a nephrologist, and followed to 1-year. The primary clinical outcome was a major adverse kidney event at 1-year, defined as death, maintenance dialysis, or incident/progressive chronic kidney disease. RESULTS We screened 3687 participants from July 2015 to June 2017, of whom 269 were eligible. We randomized 71 (26%) patients (34 to nephrology follow-up and 37 to usual care).

The theory of global capitalism offers insight into the various transnational practices that result in the inequitable distribution of healthy life and excess death, both globally and locally. In identifying the underlying societal determinants of health (and early death), the conceptual framework highlights the roles of transnational corporations, financialization, consumerism, and transnational social classes. To delineate how the global system and systemic racism lead to necropolitical inequities across racialized groups, the concept of social triage draws attention to the organizational forms and processes affecting the distribution of healthy life. In the conceptual framework presented here, the theory of global capitalism offers a structural analysis of economic exploitation beyond a traditional state-centric framework. Social triage complements this account by providing a constructivist view of race in specific contexts of capitalist development. The rest of this article demonstrates the utility of the systems analysis offered by the theory of global capitalism along with the constructivist approach of social triage in highlighting the racist dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Global Capitalism, Racism, and Social Triage during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe. Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control. AIM: To synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence. DATA SOURCES: Searches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020. RESULTS: Only five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics. All were observational studies. Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to 'systems' (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), 'space' (recognised need for more care in the community), 'staff' (training needs and resilience) and 'stuff' (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations). CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.","output":"The role and response of primary healthcare services in the delivery of palliative care in epidemics and pandemics: A rapid review to inform practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing our entire society to adopt numerous changes, at least until an effective treatment and/or vaccine becomes widely available.

However, the role of S100A9 in regulating neutrophil activation, inflammation and lung damage in sepsis is not known. Herein, we hypothesized that blocking S100A9 function may attenuate neutrophil recruitment in septic lung injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with the S100A9 inhibitor ABR-238901 (10 mg/kg), prior to cercal ligation and puncture (CLP). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were harvested for analysis of neutrophil infiltration as well as edema and CXC chemokine production. Blood was collected for analysis of membrane-activated complex-1 (Mac-1) expression on neutrophils as well as CXC chemokines and IL-6 in plasma. Induction of CLP markedly increased plasma levels of S100A9. ABR-238901 decreased CLP-induced neutrophil infiltration and edema formation in the lung. In addition, inhibition of S100A9 decreased the CLP-induced up-regulation of Mac-1 on neutrophils. Administration of ABR-238901 also inhibited the CLP-induced increase of CXCL-1, CXCL-2 and IL-6 in plasma and lungs. Our results suggest that S100A9 promotes neutrophil activation and pulmonary accumulation in sepsis. Targeting S100A9 function decreased formation of CXC chemokines in circulation and lungs and attenuated sepsis-induced lung damage. These novel findings suggest that S100A9 plays an important pro-inflammatory role in sepsis and could be a useful target to protect against the excessive inflammation and lung damage associated with the disease.","output":"Targeting S100A9 Reduces Neutrophil Recruitment, Inflammation and Lung Damage in Abdominal Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in human placentae.

METHODS: We compared mRNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry mediators ACE2, TMPRSS2 and L-SIGN (an alternative entry receptor) by qPCR in 105 placentae: 45 from pregnant women with HIV (WHIV) exposed to protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART, 17 from WHIV on non-PI-based ART, and 43 from HIV-uninfected women. RESULTS: ACE2 levels were lower, while L-SIGN levels were higher in placentae from WHIV on PI-based ART as compared to those on non-PI-based ART and to HIV-uninfected women. TMPRSS2 levels were similar between groups. Black race was significantly associated with lower expression of ACE2 and higher expression of L-SIGN. ACE2 levels were significantly higher in placentae of female fetuses. DISCUSSION: We have identified pregnant women of Black race and WHIV who are on PI-based ART to have relatively lower expression of placental ACE2 than those of White race and HIV-uninfected women. This effect may potentially contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in these women, either favorably; by reduced viral entry, or detrimentally; by loss of ACE2 protection against hyperinflammation.","output":"ACE2, TMPRSS2 and L-SIGN expression in placentae from HIV-positive pregnancies exposed to antiretroviral therapy-implications for SARS-CoV-2 placental infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An analysis of published literature data on the relationship of parasitic diseases and oncogenesis is carried out.

The CAD was utilized and optimized by hyper-parameters for shallow learning, e.g., SVM and deep learning. For the deep learning, mini-batch stochastic gradient descent was used to overcome fitting problems during transfer learning. The optimal parameter list values were found using the na?ve Bayes technique.

Healthcare personnel are highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, we decided to offer them ivermectin as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) method. Purpose: Primary outcome was to measure the number of healthcare workers with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test in the ivermectin group and in the control group. Secondary outcome was to measure the number of sick healthcare workers with a positive RT-PCR COVID-19 test whose condition deteriorated and required hospitalization and/or an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or who died, in the ivermectin group and in the control group. Material and methods: This observational and retrospective cohort study was carried out in two medical centers, Centro Medico Bournigal (CMBO) in Puerto Plata and Centro Medico Punta Cana (CMPC) in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The study began on June 29, 2020, and ended on July 26, 2020. A Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Propensity Score Matching procedure was applied in a 1:1 ratio to homogeneously evaluate 271 healthcare personnel that adhered to a PrEP program with ivermectin at a weekly oral (PO) dose of 0.2 mg/kg, and 271 healthcare personnel who did not adhere to the program were assigned as a control group. Results: In 28 days of follow-up, significant protection of ivermectin preventing the infection from SARS-CoV-2 was observed: 1.8% compared to those who did not take it (6.6%; p-value = 0.006), with a risk reduction of 74% (HR 0.26, 95% CI [0.10,0.71]).

This link is as old as the history of Pediatrics, and dates to the second half of the eighteenth century. The vocation of the first European pediatric schools, indeed, was clinical and scientific, as well as social. The founding fathers of Pediatrics were scientists of great talent, and many of them benefactors and philanthropists. They spent their lives assisting the suffering childhood, and became promoters and organizers of social securities for the poorest and most vulnerable categories. The attention to the problems of abandonment was closely linked to study, prevention, and treatment of pathologies (especially infectious, deficiency and neurological ones). The profile and activity of pediatricians grew in the following decades after the birth of the first pediatric schools. The University institutions contributed to provide a further impulse to childcare as well as cultural authority, also thanks to the foundation of the first chairs and scientific journals of Pediatrics. The relevance and prestige of the studies performed rapidly spread throughout Europe, and also reached our country, contributing to a progressive and relevant improvement in the quality of childrens care, and in the meantime to the decrease of neonatal and infant mortality rates. Todays pediatricians, as in the past, must spend his efforts to face the needs of children and their families, be their social receptor, interpreter if necessary, and credible and authoritative interlocutor beside institutions. The current coronavirus pandemic dramatically exposed social inequalities and inequities. In this new scenario, the pediatricians role of defender of all children becomes even more necessary and indispensable. Here we trace the historical steps which led to the birth and development of pediatrics, as independent medical discipline with ethical and social vocation.

The culture within contact sports, such as ice hockey, encourages aggression that puts youth at risk of TBI such as concussion. Newspaper reports play an important role in conveying and shaping the culture around health-related behaviors. We qualitatively studied reports about sport-related TBI in four major North American newspapers over the last quarter-century. We used the grounded-theory approach to identify major themes and then did a content analysis to compare the frequency of key themes between 1998C2000 and 2009C2011. The major themes were: perceptions of brain injury, aggression, equipment, rules and regulations, and youth hockey. Across the full study period, newspaper articles from Canada and America portrayed violence and aggression that leads to TBI both as integral to hockey and as an unavoidable risk associated with playing the game. They also condemned violence in ice hockey, criticized the administrative response to TBI, and recognized the significance of TBI. In Canada, aggression was reported more often recently and there was a distinctive shift in portraying protective equipment as a solution to TBI in earlier years to a potential contributing factor to TBI later in the study period. American newspapers gave a greater attention to perception of risks and the role of protective equipment, and discussed TBI in a broader context in the recent time period. Newspapers from both countries showed similar recent trends in regards to a need for rule changes to curb youth sport-related TBI.

A sample composed of 597 (M(age) = 22.08, SD = 3.33) undergraduates enrolled in a sport science degree from Ecuador participated in this study. Non-Perfectionists reported lower levels of motives, whereas Adaptive and Maladaptive Perfectionists reported higher scores on all participation motives. Significant and positive correlations were found between PS and both autonomous and controlled motives, whereas PC was positively correlated with controlled reasons and only significantly correlated with some autonomous reasons by the effect of PS. In terms of barriers, Maladaptive Perfectionists reported significantly higher scores on all barriers analyzed in comparison with the other three profiles, with moderate and large effect sizes.

In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS.

Aim of this study was to investigate the immunological mechanism underlying the clinical association between air pollution, namely exposure to particulate matter 10 (PM10), and inflammatory activity of multiple sclerosis (MS) METHODS: Daily recording of PM10 was obtained by monitors depending on the residence of subjects. Expression of molecules involved in activation, adhesion, and migration of T lymphocytes were tested by flow cytometry in 57 MS patients and 19 healthy controls. We next assessed in vitro the effect of PM10 on expression of C-C chemokine receptors 6 (CCR6) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), on cytokine production by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDC), and on T cell polarization in PBMC/mdDC mixed cultures. RESULTS: We identified a significant correlation between mean PM10 levels and expression of CCR6 CD4+ T circulating cells in MS patients. This was paralleled by the observation in vitro of a higher level of CCR6 expression on PBMC following treatment with increased doses of particulate matter. Moreover, in mdDC cultures, particulate matter induced the secretion by mdDC of Th17 polarizing IL1 beta, IL6, and IL23 and, in mdDC/PBMC mixed cultures, enhanced generation of IL17-producing T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo and in vitro studies support the pro-inflammatory role of PM in MS, by upregulating expression of CCR6 on circulating CD4+ T cells and inducing in innate immune cells the production of Th17 polarizing cytokines. Therefore, we speculate that in MS respiratory exposure to PM10 may induce the production in the lung of autoreactive Th17 lymphocytes and boost their migratory properties through the blood-brain barrier.","output":"Air pollution as a contributor to the inflammatory activity of multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health ethics has emerged and grown as an independent discipline over the last decade.

The cases of tumor-stroma ratio more than 50% were categorized as tumor-stroma ratio high, and those less than 50% and below were categorized as tumor-stroma ratio low. RESULTS: Tumor-stroma ratio-high tumors had shorter overall survival (p=0.002). Disease-free survival tended to be shorter in tumor-stroma ratio-high tumors (p=0.082) compared with tumor-stroma ratio-low tumors. Tumor-stroma ratio was an independent prognostic parameter for the total group of patients (p=0.003) and also axillary lymph node metastasis and tumor-stroma ratio was statistically associated (p=0.004). Also, tumor-stroma ratio was an independent prognostic parameter in node-positive Luminal A and B subgroups for overall survival (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Tumor-stroma ratio is an independent prognostic parameter that can be evaluated quite easily in all molecular subtypes of all breast cancers and does not require extra cost and time to evaluate.","output":"An easy and practical prognostic parameter: tumor-stroma ratio in Luminal, Her2, and triple-negative breast cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we analyze the role of Labor and Social Security Inspectorate (Inspeccin de Trabajo y Seguridad Social in Spanish) in the assessment and management of the risks associated to COVID-19 in the workplaces, since the beginning of the pandemic until the enforcement of the Royal Decree-Law 26/2020, with special focus on the Operative and Technical Criteria issued by the Directorate of the State Labor and Social Security Inspectorate.

Despite increasing improvements in disease management, a huge medical need still exists as its relentless progression cannot be delayed by current treatments. Therefore, scientists, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies are hunting new drugs with 'disease-modifying' properties. AREAS COVERED: This review concentrates on new therapeutics - excluding cell and gene therapies - under investigation for PD with 'disease-modifying' potential. This is a global, comprehensive picture of the current innovative drug pipeline, where the main preclinical and clinical data available are provided. Drug candidates presented include &#945;-synuclein modulating agents, neuroprotective agents and neuroinflammation modulators, kinase modulators, neurotrophic factors, and drugs acting on emerging targets. EXPERT OPINION: There is excitement for agents with 'disease-modifying' properties and the authors found more than 130 assets, not including cell and gene therapies under investigation - most of them still in preclinical development - meaning that the science is progressing multiple, diverse new opportunities. Many limitations hamper the successful development of these drug candidates such as the translational accuracy of preclinical models, the current clinical development paradigm as well as the lack of biomarkers to be used in diagnosis and therapy management.","output":"Therapeutic innovation in Parkinson's disease: a 2020 update on disease-modifying approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly swept over the world, becoming one of the most devastating outbreaks in human history.

Its reduced expression is associated with a high risk of secondary infections in septic patients and can be safely corrected by Interferon-y (IFNy) injection. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) induces an alteration of Interferon (IFN) genes expression potentially responsible for the observed low HLA-DR expression in circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR). METHODS: We report a case of one-time INFy injection (100 mcg s.c.) in a superinfected 61-year-old man with COVID-19Cassociated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with monitoring of mHLA-DR expression and clinical tolerance. OBSERVATIONS: Low mHLA-DR pretreatment expression (26.7%) was observed. IFNy therapy leading to a rapid increase in mHLA-DR expression (83.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Severe ARDS in a COVID-19 patient has a deep reduction in mHLA-DR expression concomitantly with secondary infections. The unique IFNy injection was safe and led to a sharp increase in the expression of mHLA-DR. Based on immune and infection monitoring, more cases of severe COVID-19 patients with low mHLA-DR should be treated by IFNy to test the clinical effectiveness.","output":"Case Report: Interferon- Restores Monocytic Human Leukocyte Antigen Receptor (mHLA-DR) in Severe COVID-19 With Acquired Immunosuppression Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims Patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may develop acute respiratory inflammation, due to an exaggerated immune response and some develop chronic complications. Neutrophils play a major role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases and have been shown to contribute to lung and vascular damage in COVID-19. Our aim was to establish a relationship between neutrophil phenotype and disease severity and to determine whether neutrophil abnormalities persist in convalescent patients. Methods Peripheral blood samples were obtained from acute COVID-19 patients (n = 74), follow-up (FU) patients discharged following inpatient admission (n = 56), a median of 87 days after discharge, and healthy controls (HCs, n = 22). Patients were stratified by disease severity based on inspired oxygen (FiO2) and admission to intensive care (ICU). Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood by negative selection for phenotyping and functional analysis. PBMC Isolation Tubes were used to quantify and phenotype low density neutrophils (LDNs) within the PBMC fraction. For quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, isolated neutrophils were incubated with a ROS reactive dye, DHR-123 and stimulated with PMA. All samples were stained and fixed prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Results There was a marked increase in neutrophils expressing the activation and degranulation markers, CD64 (P < 0.0001) and CD63 (P < 0.0001) and a reduction in neutrophils expressing the maturity markers, CD10 (P < 0.0005) and CD101 (P < 0.0005) in patients with acute COVID-19 compared to HCs. Increased frequency of neutrophils expressing CD64 (P < 0.005), CD63 (P < 0.01) and expressing decreased CD101 (P < 0.0001) were also detected in FU patients compared to HCs. Notably, 42.3  4.4% of neutrophils were CD101(lo) in FU patients, compared to 29.0  3.7% in acute patients and 9.6  4.1% in HCs. These changes were most apparent in FU patients recovering from severe COVID-19 compared to mild or moderate disease. The frequency of LDNs in PBMCs from acute patients was significantly higher than HCs (P < 0.0001), and correlated with disease severity. Similarly, the frequency of LDNs in FU patients was significantly higher than in HCs (P < 0.0005). We found a trend towards higher basal ROS production in acute and FU patients, but a blunted response to PMA stimulated ROS production in neutrophils from acute patients versus HCs (P < 0.0001). Impaired ROS production persisted in FU patients compared to HCs (P < 0.01). Conclusion Circulating neutrophils in acute COVID-19 have an altered phenotype and comprise immature and activated cells. This altered phenotype persisted in convalescence and may contribute to the persistence of symptoms and an increased susceptibility to subsequent infections. Future work will aim to investigate the functional implications of these findings. Disclosure T.O. Williams: None. V. K?stele: None. E.R. Mann: None. S.B. Knight: None. M. Menon: None. C.

With the extant and anticipated reduction of clinical testing as the disease moves into an endemic state, SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance (WWS) is likely to have greater value as an important diagnostic tool to inform public health. As the widespread adoption of WWS is relatively new at the scale employed for COVID-19, interpretation of data, including the relationship to clinical cases, has yet to be standardized. An in-depth analysis of the metrics derived from WWS is required for public health units/agencies to interpret and utilize WWS-acquired data effectively and efficiently. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater signal to clinical cases (WC) ratio was investigated across seven different cities in Canada over periods ranging from 8 to 21 months. Significant increases in the WC ratio occurred when clinical testing eligibility was modified to appointment-only testing, identifying a period of insufficient clinical testing in these communities. The WC ratio decreased significantly during the emergence of the Alpha variant of concern (VOC) in a relatively non-immunized community's wastewater (40-60% allelic proportion), while a more muted decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Delta VOC in a relatively well-immunized community's wastewater (40-60% allelic proportion). Finally, a rapid and significant decrease in the WC ratio signaled the emergence of the Omicron VOC, likely because of the variant's greater effectiveness at evading immunity, leading to a significant number of new reported clinical cases, even when vaccine-induced community immunity was high. The WC ratio, used as an additional monitoring metric, complements clinical case counts and wastewater signals as individual metrics in its ability to identify important epidemiological occurrences, adding value to WWS as a diagnostic technology during the COVID-19 pandemic and likely for future pandemics.","output":"Wastewater to clinical case (WC) ratio of COVID-19 identifies insufficient clinical testing, onset of new variants of concern and population immunity in urban communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The massive worldwide transition of the transport sector to electric vehicles has dramatically increased the demand for lithium.

In this retrospective, single institution, cohort study that analyzed patients admitted to a community academic hospital with the diagnosis of Covid-19, we found that elevations of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) at any time during hospital admission increased the odds of ICU admission by 5.12 (95% CI: 1.55-16.89; p = 0.007), 4.71 (95% CI: 1.51-14.69; p = 0.01) and 4.12 (95% CI: 1.21-14.06, p = 0.02), respectively.

These people may be at serious risk of covid-19. Information about the effects of Covid-19 on people living with HIV, is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 61-year-old man who was a known case of HIV from 6 years ago that was being treated with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).

Due to the lack of consistency in data reporting during the initial spread of COVID-19, the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act was introduced into the Congress that mandates collection and reporting of demographic COVID-19 data on testing, treatments, and deaths by age, sex, race and ethnicity, primary language, socioeconomic status, disability, and county. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated how COVID-19 demographic data have been collected before and after the introduction of this legislation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate differences in reporting and public availability of COVID-19 demographic data by US state health departments and Washington, District of Columbia (DC) before (pre-Act), immediately after (post-Act), and 6 months after (6-month follow-up) the introduction of the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act in the Congress on April 21, 2020. METHODS: We reviewed health department websites of all 50 US states and Washington, DC (N=51). We evaluated how each state reported age, sex, and race and ethnicity data for all confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths and how they made this data available (ie, charts and tables only or combined with dashboards and machine-actionable downloadable formats) at the three timepoints. RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in the number of health departments reporting age-specific data for COVID-19 cases (P=.045) and resulting deaths (P=.002), sex-specific data for COVID-19 deaths (P=.003), and race- and ethnicity-specific data for confirmed cases (P=.003) and deaths (P=.005) post-Act and at the 6-month follow-up (P<.05 for all). The largest increases were race and ethnicity state data for confirmed cases (pre-Act: 18/51, 35%; post-Act: 31/51, 61%; 6-month follow-up: 46/51, 90%) and deaths due to COVID-19 (pre-Act: 13/51, 25%; post-Act: 25/51, 49%; and 6-month follow-up: 39/51, 76%). Although more health departments reported race and ethnicity data based on federal requirements (P<.001), over half (29/51, 56.9%) still did not report all racial and ethnic groups as per the Office of Management and Budget guidelines (pre-Act: 5/51, 10%; post-Act: 21/51, 41%; and 6-month follow-up: 27/51, 53%).

ALICE had already been offering virtual visits for remote audiences with equipment installed in the ALICE Run Control Centre (ARC). We recently acquired dedicated mobile equipment for the virtual visits to the cavern and developed a scenario which includes both the cavern and the ARC as well as a Q&A session. In this way, visitors from many countries have the opportunity to interact with scientists and to see parts of the experiment that they would never be able to see during a real visit. ALICE has been participating in the International Masterclasses (IMC) programme ever since measurements based on LHC data were introduced in it. The packages used had been developed by simplifying the ALICE event display and were based on ROOT. With the spreading of the COVID pandemic the 2020 IMC programme was interrupted. In 2021, with most activities taking place remotely, it was obvious that web-based versions were needed.

This study aimed to determine specific risk factors and prognosis of EC with PC recurrence (PCR) versus no PC recurrence (NPCR). METHODS Data of all patients with EC who received primary surgical treatment between January 2000 and February 2017 were abstracted from the French FRANCOGYN Research Group database. Clinical and pathologic variables were compared between the two groups (PCR vs. NPCR). Multivariate analysis was performed to define prognostic factors for peritoneal recurrence. Overall survivals (OS) of patients after recurrence were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The study analyzed 1466 patients, and 257 of these patients (17.5%) had recurrence. At presentation, 63 of these patients had PC. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages 3 and 4 disease were significantly associated with PCR versus NPCR (odds ratio 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.23-4.07; p = 0.008). The death rate for the patients with PC was 47.6%, with a median survival of 12 months after diagnosis of recurrence. According to the histologic subtype, OS was 29 months (Q1-Q3, 13-NA) for endometrioid carcinomas, 7.5 months (Q1-Q3, 4-15) for serous carcinomas, and 10 months (Q1-Q3, 5-15) for clear cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy for treatment of PCR was associated with improved OS after recurrence (OSAR; p = 0.0025). CONCLUSION An initial advanced stage of EC is a risk factor for PCR. For women with PCR, a diagnosis of type 1 EC recurrence more than 12 months after the initial treatment and management of PCR with chemotherapy is associated with improved OSAR.

We present a male patient who had two melanoma-in-situs (MISs) that were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of topical imiquimod 5% cream, 5-fluorouracil 2% solution, and tretinoin 0.1% cream. The successful treatments occurred without in-person visits and with the aid of telemedicine. Although surgery is the standard for the treatment of melanoma in situ, this case demonstrates an effective viable treatment modality for MIS during a pandemic situation.","output":"Treating Melanoma in Situ During a Pandemic with Telemedicine and a Combination of Imiquimod, 5-Fluorouracil, and Tretinoin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although a nationwide lockdown was imposed in India amid COVID-19 outbreak since March 24, 2020, the COVID-19 infection is increasing day-by-day. Till June 10, 2021 India has recorded 29,182,072 COVID cases and 359,695 deaths. A number of factors help to influence COVID-19 transmission rate and prevalence. Accordingly, the present study intended to integrate the climatic parameters, namely ambient air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (H) with population mass (PM) to determine their influence for rapid transmission of COVID-19 in India. The sensibility of AT, H and PM parameters on COVID-19 transmission was investigated based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) classification model. The results depicted that AT and H models have very low sensibility (i.e., lower area under curve value 0.26 and 0.37, respectively compared with AUC value 0.5) to induce virus transmission and discrimination between infected people and healthy ones. Contrarily, PM model is highly sensitive (AUC value is 0.912, greater than AUC value 0.5) towards COVID-19 transmission and discrimination between infected people and healthy ones and approximate population of 2.25 million must impose like social distancing, personal hygiene, etc. as strategic management policy.

This technology offers an extremely good energy resolution - comparable to semiconductor detectors - and a wide choice of target materials, making low temperature calorimetric detectors ideal for a variety of particle physics applications. Rare event searches have continued to require ever greater exposures, which has driven them to ever larger cryogenic detectors, with the CUORE experiment being the first to reach a tonne-scale, mK-cooled, experimental mass. CUORE, designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, has been operational since 2017 at a temperature of about 10 mK. This result has been attained by the use of an unprecedentedly large cryogenic infrastructure called the CUORE cryostat: conceived, designed and commissioned for this purpose. In this article the main characteristics and features of the cryogenic facility developed for the CUORE experiment are highlighted. A brief introduction of the evolution of the field and of the past cryogenic facilities are given. The motivation behind the design and development of the CUORE cryogenic facility is detailed as are the steps taken toward realization, commissioning, and operation of the CUORE cryostat. The major challenges overcome by the collaboration and the solutions implemented throughout the building of the cryogenic facility will be discussed along with the potential improvements for future facilities. The success of CUORE has opened the door to a new generation of large-scale cryogenic facilities in numerous fields of science. Broader implications of the incredible feat achieved by the CUORE collaboration on the future cryogenic facilities in various fields ranging from neutrino and dark matter experiments to quantum computing will be examined.","output":"CUORE Opens the Door to Tonne-scale Cryogenics Experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whakarongorau Aotearoa/New Zealand Telehealth Services, formerly known as Homecare Medical, is New Zealand's largest digital healthcare service.

One medication currently under investigation for COVID-19 treatment is tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor. It has been shown there are increased levels of cytokines including IL-6 in severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients attributed to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Therefore, inhibition of IL-6 receptors may lead to a reduction in cytokines and prevent progression of CRS. The purpose of this retrospective study is to utilize a case-matched design to investigate clinical outcomes associated with the use of tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multi-center, case-matched series matched 1:1 on age, BMI, and days since symptom onset. Inclusion criteria included  18 years of age, laboratory confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 result, admitted to a community hospital from March 1(st) C May 8(th), 2020, and received tocilizumab while admitted. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, total mechanical ventilation days, mechanical ventilation mortality, and incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections. RESULTS: The following results are presented as tocilizumab vs control respectively. The primary outcome of in-hospital mortality for tocilizumab (n=26) vs control (n=26) was 10 (38%) vs 11 (42%) patients, p=0.777. The median hospital length of stay for tocilizumab vs control was 14 vs 11 days, p=0.275. The median days of mechanical ventilation for tocilizumab (n=21) vs control (n=15) was 8 vs 7 days, p=0.139, and the mechanical ventilation mortality was 10 (48%) vs 9 (60%) patients, p=0.463. In the tocilizumab group, for those expired (n=10) vs alive (n=16), 10 (100%) vs 7 (50%) patients respectively had a peak ferritin > 600 ng/mL, and 6 (60%) vs 8 (50%) patients had a peak D-dimer > 2,000 ng/mL. The incidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections within 7 days of tocilizumab administration occurred in 5 (19%) patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tocilizumab may be a beneficial treatment modality for severe COVID-19 patients. Larger, prospective, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further validate results. DISCLOSURES: Christian Cheatham, PharmD, BCIDP, Antimicrobial Resistance Solutions (Shareholder)","output":"562.

In order to tackle the emergence of antimicrobial resistance it is vital to understand how they appear, their relationship with the host, how they behave as a whole in the ruminal ecosystem or how they spread to the environment or humans. We sequenced ruminal samples from 416 Holstein dairy cows in 14 Spanish farms using nanopore technology, to uncover the presence of resistance genes and their potential effect on human, animal and environmental health. RESULTS: We found 998 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the cow rumen and studied the 25 most prevalent genes in the 14 dairy cattle farms. The most abundant ARGs were related to the use of antibiotics to treat mastitis, metritis and lameness, the most common diseases in dairy cattle. The relative abundance (RA) of bacteriophages was positively correlated to the ARGs RA. The heritability of the RA of the more abundant ARGs ranged between 0.10 (mupA) and 0.49 (tetW), similar to the heritability of the RA of microbes that carried those ARGs. Even though these genes are carried by the microorganisms, the host is partially controlling their RA by having a more suitable rumen pH, folds, or other physiological traits that promote the growth of those microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to determine the most prevalent ARGs (macB, msbA, parY, rpoB2, tetQ and TaeA) in the ruminal bacteria ecosystem.

However, their role and value in anatomy assessment remains under consideration. The aim of this study was to evaluate student and educator perspectives on acceptability of using novel 3D printed heart models for assessment. METHODS We used printed 3D models of the heart for first-year medical students, in small group teaching, formative assessment and revision at home. We adopted a mixed methods approach involving questionnaires, then focus groups to collect student and educator views. We used QSR Nvivo to manage thematic analysis of responses, carried out by student and educators, respectively. FINDINGS Overall, students 89% (n = 75/84) and educators 91% (n = 10/11) found the assessment acceptable. Thematic analysis of focus groups (n = 4 students, n = 5 educators) identified five key perceptions shared across student and educator groups: 3D models are the future, realism is valued, models appear feasible, consistent and provide a potential for a range of applications in assessment. DISCUSSION There was agreement between educators and students that the use of 3D heart models was acceptable. Key recognised benefits include accessibility and consistency across settings, made more relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend integration of 3D models into teaching and assessment for educational alignment and careful selection of anatomy to model.

This was meant as a valuable alternative to lost EU-market access. In contrast, non-white former British dominions - whether big (like India, Pakistan) or small (like Sri Lanka) were left on their own. The Indian Government perceived the Brexit vote initially as rather unfortunate because it would increase global instability and a weakening of the West. Indian multinationals like 'Tata', however, which had invested heavily in Britain as their gateway to Europe, saw Brexit as an economic risk. Later on, New Delhi realised also eventual policy advantages in Britain leaving the EU. The Brexit impact on Pakistan's economy remained small so far. However, Islamabad would be well advised to formulate separate policies for post-Brexit Britain and the remaining EU-27. Sri Lanka's economic and political ties with the UK, on the other hand, are considerably stronger than with any EU country. Annual trade with the UK amounted to over 10%. Therefore, Brexit impacted negatively on the Sri Lankan economy. Changes to strengthen economic relations with the UK to overcome post Brexit challenges were imperative. As for the COVID-19 pandemic, it soon became in all three countries not just a health emergency but also a social and economic crisis. Given the historic responsibility of the UK as a former colonial power and the renewed commitment of London to international free trade principles, it seems at least debatable whether the British government should not consider all its former colonies as equal partners concerning its foreign trade policy and grant them the same rights and facilities. Neben dem Brexit befrwortet London eine CANZUK-Partnerschaft mit seinen ehemaligen wei?en Siedlerkolonien Kanada, Australien und Neuseeland. Dies sah London als wertvolle Alternative zum verlorenen EU-Marktzugang. Im Gegensatz dazu wurden nicht-wei?e ehemalige britische Herrschaftsgebiete - ob gro? (wie Indien und Pakistan) oder klein (wie Sri Lanka) - sich selbst berlassen. Die indische Regierung empfand das Brexit-Votum zun?chst als eher unglcklich, weil es die globale Instabilit?t und eine Schw?chung des Westens erh?hen wrde. Indische multinationale Konzerne wie \\"Tata\\", die stark in Gro?britannien als Tor nach Europa investiert hatten, sahen den Brexit jedoch als wirtschaftliches Risiko. Sp?ter erkannte Neu-Delhi auch eventuelle politische Vorteile beim Austritt Gro?britanniens aus der EU. Die Auswirkungen des Brexit auf die pakistanische Wirtschaft blieben bisher gering. Islamabad w?re jedoch gut beraten, eine separate Politik fr Gro?britannien und die verbleibenden EU-27 nach dem Brexit zu formulieren. Die wirtschaftlichen und politischen Beziehungen Sri Lankas zum Vereinigten K?nigreich sind dagegen deutlich st?rker als zu jedem anderen EU-Land. Der j?hrliche Au?enhandel mit Gro?britannien betrug ber 10%. Daher wirkte sich der Brexit negativ auf die sri-lankische Wirtschaft aus. Ver?nderungen zur St?rkung der Wirtschaftsbeziehungen mit dem Vereinigten K?nigreich zur Bew?ltigung der Herausforderungen nach dem Brexit waren zwingend erforderlich. Die COVID-19-Pandemie entwickelte sich in allen drei L?ndern schnell von einem Gesundheitsnotstand zu einer sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Krise. Angesichts der historischen Verantwortung Gro?britanniens als ehemaliger Kolonialmacht und des erneuten Bekenntnisses Londons zu internationalen Freihandelsprinzipien erscheint es zumindest fraglich, ob die britische Regierung nicht alle ihre ehemaligen Kolonien als gleichberechtigte Partner in ihrer Au?enhandelspolitik betrachten und ihnen gleiche Rechte und M?glichkeiten einr?umen sollte.  la suite du Brexit, Londres a approuv une union CANZUK avec ses anciennes colonies de colons blancs, le Canada, l'Australie et la Nouvelle-Zlande.

En revanche, les anciens dominions britanniques non blancs - qu'ils soient grands (comme l'Inde et le Pakistan) ou petits (comme le Sri Lanka) ont t laisss  eux-mmes.

Cependant, des multinationales indiennes comme \\"Tata\\", qui avaient massivement investi en Grande-Bretagne comme porte d'entre vers l'Europe, ont vu dans le Brexit un risque conomique. Plus tard, New Delhi a galement ralis des avantages politiques ventuels en Grande-Bretagne quittant l'UE. L'impact du Brexit sur l'conomie pakistanaise est rest faible jusqu' prsent. Cependant, Islamabad serait bien avis de formuler des politiques distinctes pour la Grande-Bretagne post Brexit et le reste de l'UE-27. Les liens conomiques et politiques du Sri Lanka avec le Royaume-Uni, en revanche, sont considrablement plus forts qu'avec n'importe quel pays de l'UE.

We recently reported that apelin inhibits BK(Ca) channel function in cerebral arteries, resulting in impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations. In contrast, apelin causes endothelium-dependent relaxation of coronary arteries. However, the effects of apelin on BK(Ca) channel function in coronary arterial myocytes have not yet been explored. We hypothesized that apelin-APJ receptor signaling does not have an inhibitory effect on coronary arterial BK(Ca) channels and hence does not alter nitric oxide (NO)-dependent relaxation of coronary arteries. Patch clamp recording was used to measure whole cell K(+) currents in freshly isolated coronary smooth muscle cells. Apelin had no effect on the increases in current density in response to membrane depolarization or to NS1619 (a BK(Ca) channel opener). Moreover, apelin did not inhibit NO/cGMP-dependent relaxations that required activation of BK(Ca) channels in isolated coronary arteries. Apelin-APJ receptor signaling caused a marked increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels in coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, but failed to activate PI3-kinase to increase phosphorylation of Akt protein. Collectively, these data provide mechanistic evidence that apelin has no inhibitory effects on BK(Ca) channel function in coronary arteries. The lack of inhibitory effect on BK(Ca) channels makes it unlikely that activation of APJ receptors in coronary arteries would adversely affect coronary flow by creating a vasoconstrictive environment. It can be expected that apelin or other APJ receptor agonists in development will not interfere with the vasodilator effects of endogenous BK(Ca) channel openers.","output":"Apelin Does Not Impair Coronary Artery Relaxation Mediated by Nitric Oxide-Induced Activation of BK(Ca) Channels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel interventions are needed to reach young people and adult men with HIV services given the low HIV testing rates in these population sub-groups.

METHODS: This study was conducted among young people (15-24 years) and adult men (25+ years) between May and August 2019. The study entailed distribution of HIVST kits by trained \\"peer-leaders,\\" who were selected from existing social networks and trained in HIVST distribution processes. Peer-leaders received up to 10 kits to distribute to eligible social network members (i.e. aged 15-24 years if young people or 25+ years if adult man, not tested in the past 3 months, and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status at enrolment). The intervention was evaluated against the feasibility benchmark of 70% of peer-leaders distributing up to 70% of the kits that they received; and the acceptability benchmark of >80% of the respondents self-testing for HIV. RESULTS: Of 298 enrolled into the study at baseline, 56.4% (n = 168) were young people (15-24 years) and 43.6% (n = 130) were adult males (25+ years). Peer-leaders received 298 kits and distributed 296 (99.3%) kits to their social network members. Of the 282 interviewed at follow-up, 98.2% (n = 277) reported that they used the HIVST kits.

METHODS: We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a five-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n = 129) showed that most participants reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean = 4.26).

A susceptibleexposedinfectiousasymptomaticrecovered (SEIAR) model was developed for the assessment. The information of each confirmed case and asymptomatic infection was collected from Ningbo Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate the key parameters of the model in Ningbo City, China. A total of 157 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 51 imported cases and 106 secondary cases) and 30 asymptomatic infections were reported in Ningbo City. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increasing trend. The proportion of elder people in the asymptomatic infections was lower than younger people, and the difference was statistically significant (Fishers Exact Test, P = 0.034). There were 22 clusters associated with 167 SARS-CoV-2 infections, among which 29 cases were asymptomatic infections, accounting for 17.37%. We found that the secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic infections was almost the same as that of symptomatic cases, and no statistical significance was observed ((2) = 0.052, P = 0.819) by KruskalCWallis test. The effective reproduction number (R(eff)) was 1.43, which revealed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was moderate. If the interventions had not been strengthened, the duration of the outbreak would have lasted about 16 months with a simulated attack rate of 44.15%. The total attack rate (TAR) and duration of the outbreak would increase along with the increasing delay of intervention. SARS-CoV-2 had moderate transmissibility in Ningbo City, China.

When using indirect VL, it has been suggested that it may be preferable to obtain a deliberately restricted view of the larynx to facilitate passage of the endotracheal tube. We used the GlideScope? GVL video laryngoscope (GVL) to test whether deliberately obtaining a restricted view would result in faster and easier tracheal intubation than with a full view of the larynx. METHODS We recruited 163 elective surgical patients and randomly allocated the participants to one of two groups: Group F, where a full view of the larynx was obtained and held during GVL-facilitated tracheal intubation, and Group R, with a restricted view of the larynx (< 50% of glottic opening visible). Study investigators experienced in indirect VL performed the intubations. The intubations were recorded and the video recordings were subsequently assessed for total time to intubation, ease of intubation using a visual analogue scale (VAS; where 0 = easy and 100 = difficult), first-attempt success rate, and oxygen saturation after intubation. Complications were also assessed. RESULTS The median [interquartile range (IQR)] time to intubation was faster in Group R than in Group F (27 [22-36] sec vs 36 [27-48] sec, respectively; median difference, 9 sec; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 13; P < 0.001). The median [IQR] VAS rating for ease of intubation was also better in Group R than in Group F (14 [6-42) mm vs 50 mm [17-65], respectively; median difference, 20 mm; 95% CI, 10 to 31; P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups regarding the first-attempt success rate, oxygen saturation immediately after intubation, or complications. CONCLUSIONS Using the GVL with a deliberately restricted view of the larynx resulted in faster and easier tracheal intubation than with a full view and with no additional complications. Our study suggests that obtaining a full or Cormack-Lehane grade 1 view may not be desirable when using the GVL.

The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased pressure to adopt hypofractionation because of concerns about disease spread at treatment centers. We know of no recent U.S. study of trends in radiation fractionation that includes comparisons of multiple disease sites and data post-COVID. Therefore, we sought to describe trends in treatment fractionation at a single academic center from 2014-2020. MATERIALS/METHODS From our institutional database, for the years 2014-2020, we extracted the total number of patients treated, total number of fractions delivered, and mean number of fractions per treatment course for all cancers and specifically for treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, and bone metastases. For breast and prostate, we included only radiation courses delivered to the primary site. RESULTS The dataset included 16,224 courses of radiation treatment and 257,352 treatment fractions. The mean number of fractions per treatment course overall declined steadily throughout the study period, from 18.3 in 2014 to 14.9 in 2020. For breast cancer, the mean number of fractions per treatment course was steady from 2014-2016 but began to decline more rapidly from 2017-2020. Fractionation for prostate cancer followed a similar time trend, but there was a more substantial decline from 2014 (mean 36.6 fractions per treatment course) to 2020 (mean 16.7 fractions per treatment course). For bone metastases, fractionation was relatively consistent throughout the study period. For breast patients, during the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the monthly rate of decrease in number of fractions increased to 0.19 from a historical mean of 0.05, as the mean number of sessions dropped from 22 to 19. For bone metastases, in 2020, the mean number of sessions dropped from 6.3 to 5.3, with a monthly rate of decrease of 0.13 compared to historical mean of 0.03. COVID-19 did not spike the monthly rate of change in number of fractions for prostate which began a steady decline in 2017 with increased use of SBRT. CONCLUSION We observed increased adoption of hypofractionation at our institution during the study period for both breast and prostate cancer. For bone metastases, hypofractionation had largely been adopted before the study period. There was evidence of an accelerated trend toward hypofractionation for some cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Trends in Radiation Oncology Treatment Fractionation at a Single Academic Center, 2014-2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH)/Caffey disease is an inflammatory collagenopathy of infancy, manifested by subperiosteal bone hyperplasia. Genetically, ICH was linked with heterozygosity for an R836C mutation in the COL1A1 gene. Although an autosomal-recessive trait is also suspected, it has not been proven thus far. METHODS: A case of an infant male born to consanguineous parents is reported, presenting with classical findings, course, and clinical outcome of ICH. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in order to identify a possible underlying genetic defect. RESULTS: WES analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in lysine 2 of fetuin-A, encoded by the ALPHA-2-HS-GLYCOPROTEIN (AHSG) gene (c.A4T; p.K2X). Fetuin-A is an important regulator of bone remodeling and an inhibitor of ectopic mineralization. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we show a complete deficiency of this protein in the patients serum, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: A novel homozygous nonsense mutation in AHSG gene has been found in ICH patient with a typical phenotype, resulting in fetuin-A deficiency. This finding postulates an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance in ICH, which, unlike the autosomal-dominant inheritance associated with COL1A1, is associated with AHSG and fetuin-A deficiency.","output":"Fetuin-A deficiency is associated with infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 60-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and non-productive cough for 1 week, which was preceding a recent COVID-19 infection.

During DISE the patients are sedated to obtain a muscular relaxation of the upper airway which mimics the relaxation during natural sleep. Different sleep stages are intended to be simulated by drug induced sedation, and it is helpful to measure the depth of sedation. The BiSpectral Index? (BIS) is often used for this procedure. Besides the BIS, other means of sedation depth monitoring exist in anaesthesiology but have not yet been investigated with respect to DISE. Monitoring of the Cerebral State Index? (CSI) is one of these methods. The aim of the study was to compare the BIS and CSI for sedation depth monitoring during DISE. METHODS Sixty patients underwent DISE monitored by the BIS and CSI in parallel. The BIS and CSI values were compared using the Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS The BIS and CSI values differed during the course of sedation during DISE by a mean of - 6.07. At light sedation (BIS 60-80), lower values by 10 scale points of CSI compared with BIS were detectable. At deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50), the CSI turned to present equal and even higher values compared with the BIS. CONCLUSION Sedation depth measurement during DISE can be performed by the BIS or CSI, but the differences should be interpreted carefully as comparable data for sleep stages in natural sleep are available only for BIS.","output":"Depth of sedation during drug induced sedation endoscopy monitored by BiSpectral Index? and Cerebral State Index?."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have led to massive admissions to intensive care units (ICUs). An ultrasound examination of the thorax is widely performed on admission in these patients. The primary objective of our study was to assess the performance of the lung ultrasound score (LUS) on ICU admission to predict the 28-day mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to asses the performance of thoracic ultrasound and biological markers of cardiac injury to predict mortality. METHODS: This multicentre, retrospective, observational study was conducted in six ICUs of four university hospitals in France from 15 March to 3 May 2020. Patients admitted to ICUs because of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory failure and those who received an LUS examination at admission were included. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve was determined for the LUS score to predict the 28-day mortality rate. The same analysis was performed for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, brain natriuretic peptide and ultra-sensitive troponin levels at admission. RESULTS: In 57 patients, the 28-day mortality rate was 21%. The area under the ROC curve of the LUS score value on ICU admission was 0.68 [95% CI 0.54-0.82; p = 0.05]. In non-intubated patients on ICU admission (n = 40), the area under the ROC curves was 0.84 [95% CI 0.70-0.97; p = 0.005]. The best cut-off of 22 corresponded to 85% specificity and 83% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: LUS scores on ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 did not efficiently predict the 28-day mortality rate. Performance was better for non-intubated patients at admission.

Herein, we describe the characterization of both untranslated regions, frameshifting signal, putative genome-linked virus protein (VPg) and conserved antigenic epitopes of several novel PoAstV3 genomes. Twenty complete coding sequences (CDS) were obtained from 32 diagnostic cases originating from 11 individual farms/systems sharing a nucleotide (amino acid) percent identity of 89.74C100% (94.79C100%), 91.9C100% (96.3C100%) and 90.71C100% (93.51C100%) for ORF1a, ORF1ab and ORF2, respectively. Our results indicate that the 5UTR of PoAstV3 is highly conserved highlighting the importance of this region in translation initiation while their 3UTR is moderately conserved among strains, presenting alternative configurations including multiple putative protein binding sites and pseudoknots. Moreover, two predicted conserved antigenic epitopes were identified matching the 3 termini of VP27 of PoAstV3 USA strains. These epitopes may aid in the design and development of vaccine components and diagnostic assays useful to control outbreaks of PoAstV3-associated CNS disease.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy and maternal and neonatal outcomes in a large cohort study. Furthermore, to evaluate if timing of vaccination during pregnancy is related to adverse outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of women who delivered between December 2020 and July 2021 at a large tertiary medical center. Excluded were women with multiple pregnancy, vaccination prior to pregnancy, COVID-19 infection during or before pregnancy, or unknown timing of vaccination. Primary outcomes were the incidence of preterm labor and of small for gestational age. Secondary outcomes were other maternal and neonatal complications. A secondary analysis investigating the association between time of vaccination and outcomes was also performed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: There were 5618 women who met the inclusion criteria: 2,305 (41%) women were vaccinated and 3,313 (59%) were unvaccinated. There were no differences between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients with respect to primary outcomes. The rate of preterm birth was 5.5% in the vaccinated group compared to 6.2% in the unvaccinated group (p = 0.31). Likewise, the rates of small for gestational age were comparable between the two groups (6.2% vs. 7.0% respectively, p = 0.2). In a secondary analysis focusing on time of vaccination and its relationship with outcomes, patients vaccinated in the second trimester (n = 964) and in the third trimester (n = 1329) were independently compared to their unvaccinated counterparts. Women who were vaccinated in the second trimester were more likely to have a preterm birth (8.1% vs. 6.2%, p < 0.001).

This paper intends to present a social distance framework based on deep learning architecture as a precautionary step that helps to maintain, monitor, manage, and reduce the physical interaction between individuals in a real-time top view environment. We used Faster-RCNN for human detection in the images. As the human's appearance significantly varies in a top perspective; therefore, the architecture is trained on the top view human data set. Moreover, taking advantage of transfer learning, a new trained layer is fused with a pre-trained architecture. After detection, the pair-wise distance between peoples is estimated in an image using Euclidean distance. The detected bounding box's information is utilized to measure the central point of an individual detected bounding box. A violation threshold is defined that uses distance to pixel information and determines whether two people violate social distance or not. Experiments are conducted using various test images; results demonstrate that the framework effectively monitors the social distance between peoples.

METHODS: Retrospective, uncontrolled multicentre single-arm case series of hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, treated with inhaled nebulised UFH (5000 IU q8h, 10 000 IU q4h, or 25 000 IU q6h) for 6  3 (mean  standard deviation) days. Outcomes were activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) before treatment (baseline) and highest-level during treatment (peak), and adverse events including bleeding. Exploratory efficacy outcomes were oxygenation, assessed by ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) and FiO2 , and the World Health Organisation modified ordinal clinical scale. RESULTS: There were 98 patients included. In patients on stable prophylactic or therapeutic systemic anticoagulant therapy but not receiving therapeutic UFH infusion, APTT levels increased from baseline of 34  10 seconds to a peak of 38  11 seconds (P < .0001). In 3 patients on therapeutic UFH infusion, APTT levels did not significantly increase from baseline of 72  20 to a peak of 84  28 seconds (P = .17).

Consequently, the social network structure of populations plays a key role in shaping infectious disease dynamics. A huge research effort has examined how specific social network structures make populations more (or less) vulnerable to damaging epidemics. However, it can be just as important to understand how social networks can contribute to endemic disease dynamics, in which pathogens are maintained at stable levels for prolonged periods of time. Hosts that can maintain endemic disease may serve as keystone hosts for multi-host pathogens within an ecological community, and also have greater potential to act as key wildlife reservoirs of agricultural and zoonotic diseases. Here, we examine combinations of social and demographic processes that can foster endemic disease in hosts. We synthesise theoretical and empirical work to demonstrate the importance of both social structure and social dynamics in maintaining endemic disease.

Objectives This study analyzed the effect of social distancing on resistance training practitioners' quality of life and perception of body image in silhouette. Methods The volunteers were contacted through social media; data were collected between April 13 and 19, 2020, through a structured questionnaire, comprised of an Informed Consent Form, four questions about COVID-19 and restrictive measures; and twenty-nine questions designed to characterize the individuals' habits; as well as the Short Form Health Survey 36 questionnaire. All the questionnaires were applied over the Internet, using Google Forms?. After collection, the data were tabulated and interpreted using the software program AppleNumbers?, and subsequently presented as mean, standard deviation and percentiles. Results The results revealed changes in perception of body image and decreased frequency and satisfaction with training. There was also an increase in sedentary behavior, food intake, and amount of sleep; and a reduction in parameters related to health and quality of life. Conclusions The strategy of social distancing, adopted to curb the progress of COVID-19, has harmful consequences for resistance training practitioners, such as increased calorie intake, stress and anxiety, as well as possible psychological effects. These consequences, in turn, lead to changes in self-perception of body image and in the quality of training.

However, the predictive power of each of these indicators in disease classification and prognosis remains largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively collected information on the above parameters in 142 patients with COVID-19, stratifying them by survival or disease severity. Findings: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct were significantly altered between survivors and non-survivors. LYM%, CRP, and IL-6 were the most sensitive and reliable factors in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. These indicators were significantly different between critically ill and severe/moderate patients. Only LYM% levels were significantly different between severe and moderate types. Among all the investigated indicators, LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable in discriminating between critically ill, severe, and moderate types and between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct, but not LA, could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients. LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. We recommend that LYM% be further investigated in the management of COVID-19.

Data were collected by interviewing cyclists along three bike lanes of an urban area of southern Italy through a face-to-face survey. The survey was conducted in Autumn 2019, interviewing a sample of 129 cyclists. In order to identify the critical aspects of the bike paths, both an importance-performance analysis (IPA) and a gap-IPA were performed. The average values of the cyclists perceptions of each aspect have been considered as performance values. The importance values have been obtained by performing a principal component analysis (PCA), which was helpful also for better defining the service quality phenomenon. From the PCA, six latent constructs can be identified as: Physical Nuisance; Non-physical Nuisance; Physical Comfort; Non-physical Comfort; Protection; and Ambience. The results of Gap-IPA confirmed that the criticalities of the bike paths relate to the degree of protection in relation to accidents, and to the degree of nuisance caused by pollution and opposing pedestrians along the path. Based on the conducted analyses, sustainable tourism implementing policies should be oriented in solving the emerged criticalities of the existing bike paths.

METHOD: Based on three different scales related to 'Fear of COVID-19', depression and career anxiety, a structured questionnaire was developed and the survey data was collected for this study. RESULTS: The empirical result of the study reveals that, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 fear, the future workforce is getting anxious about their future career. Again, depression from COVID-19, caused by 'Fear of COVID-19', as a mediator, has a significant indirect impact on the relationship between 'Fear of COVID-19' and future career anxiety, resulting in a full mediation. This means, due to the outbreak of 'Fear of COVID-19' people are becoming depressed and anxious about their future career which is creating a long-term negative effect on human psychology.

Recognizing the groups with higher susceptibility and fatality are in urgent need. METHODS: We retrieved the total number of confirmed incident and death cases of COVID-19 in 177 countries/territories from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Data of age and gender composition were collected from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Spearmans correlation analysis was used to explore the association between the composition of age and gender and the incidence rate (IRC), case fatality rate (CFRC), and mortality rate of COVID-19 (MRC). Multiple comparisons were adjusted by the Bonferroni method, and the threshold p-value was set as p < 0.01. Software SPSS 23.0, ArcGIS 10.6, and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used to generate our results. RESULTS: Median age was positively correlated to IRC, CFRC and MRC (r(s) = 0.60; r(s) = 0.27; r(s) = 0.61, p < 0.0001 for all). The age-dependent correlation between people over 65 years of age with IRC was higher in females, while the correlation between age distribution and CFRC as well as MRC was higher in males (p < 0.0001 for all). Besides, we found the age-gender-dependent differences were correlated to IRC in places with high income and associated with CFRC in non-high income countries/territories. CONCLUSION: The correlation between the composition of age and gender and the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 confirmed previous points that females are more susceptible to COVID-19. The results remind us that more attention should be paid to male patients, particularly those over 65 years old for enhanced clinical management.

DICE identifies clinically similar and risk-stratified subgroups that neither unsupervised clustering algorithms nor supervised risk prediction algorithms alone are guaranteed to generate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enabled by an optimization process that enforces statistical significance between the outcome and subgroup membership, DICE jointly trains 3 components, representation learning, clustering, and outcome prediction while providing interpretability to the deep representations. DICE also allows unseen patients to be predicted into trained subgroups for population-level risk stratification. We evaluated DICE using electronic health record datasets derived from 2 urban hospitals. Outcomes and patient cohorts used include discharge disposition to home among heart failure (HF) patients and acute kidney injury among COVID-19 (Cov-AKI) patients, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to baseline approaches including principal component analysis, DICE demonstrated superior performance in the cluster purity metrics: Silhouette score (0.48 for HF, 0.51 for Cov-AKI), Calinski-Harabasz index (212 for HF, 254 for Cov-AKI), and Davies-Bouldin index (0.86 for HF, 0.66 for Cov-AKI), and prediction metric: area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.83 for HF, 0.78 for Cov-AKI). Clinical evaluation of DICE-generated subgroups revealed more meaningful distributions of member characteristics across subgroups, and higher risk ratios between subgroups. Furthermore, DICE-generated subgroup membership alone was moderately predictive of outcomes. DISCUSSION: DICE addresses a gap in current machine learning approaches where predicted risk may not lead directly to actionable clinical steps.

Methods Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, considered to be from March to May 2020, on case volume and claimed hospital charges in acute care hospitals during this period. To make year-over-year comparisons, we considered cases from July 2018 to June 2020. Results A total of 2,739,878 inpatient and 53,479,658 outpatient cases from 195 hospitals were included. In the year-over-year comparisons, total claimed hospital charges decreased in April, May, June 2020 by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. Our results also showed that per-case hospital charges increased during this period, possibly to compensate for the reduced case volumes. Regression results indicated that the hospital charges in April and May 2020 decreased by 6.3% for hospitals without COVID-19 patients. For hospitals with COVID-19 patients, there was an additional decrease in proportion with the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients including suspected cases. The mean additional decrease per COVID-19 patients was estimated to 5.5 million JPY. Conclusion It is suggested that the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients were negatively incentivized.","output":"Economic impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute care hospitals in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews the many and varied mass spectrometry based responses to the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus amidst a continuing global healthcare crisis. Although RT-PCR is the most prevalent molecular based surveillance approach, improvements in the detection sensitivities with mass spectrometry coupled to the rapid nature of analysis, the high molecular precision of measurements, opportunities for high sample throughput, and the potential for in-field testing, offer advantages for characterising the virus and studying the molecular pathways by which it infects host cells. The detection of biomarkers by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, studies of viral peptides using proteotyping strategies, targeted LC-MS analyses to identify abundant peptides in clinical specimens, the analysis of viral protein glycoforms, proteomics approaches to understand impacts of infection on host cells, and examinations of point-of-care breath analysis have all been explored. This review organises and illustrates these applications with reference to the many studies that have appeared in the literature since the outbreak.

Diet modulates the intestinal microbiome and therefore has a therapeutic potential. The aim of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three versions of the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in active Crohns Disease. Methods: 18 patients with mild/moderate CD (PCDAI 15C45) aged 7 to 18 years were enrolled. Patients were randomized to either SCD, modified SCD(MSCD) or whole foods (WF) diet. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. PCDAI, inflammatory labs and multi-omics evaluations were assessed. Results: Mean age was 14.3  2.9 years. At week 12, all participants (n = 10) who completed the study achieved clinical remission. The C-reactive protein decreased from 1.3  0.7 at enrollment to 0.9  0.5 at 12 weeks in the SCD group. In the MSCD group, the CRP decreased from 1.6  1.1 at enrollment to 0.7  0.1 at 12 weeks. In the WF group, the CRP decreased from 3.9  4.3 at enrollment to 1.6  1.3 at 12 weeks. In addition, the microbiome composition shifted in all patients across the study period. While the nature of the changes was largely patient specific, the predicted metabolic mode of the organisms increasing and decreasing in activity was consistent across patients.

Objective: To examine prevalence of comorbidities, rates of hospitalization and survival, and incidence of CV manifestations of COVID-19 in a predominantly AA population in south metropolitan Chicago. Design, Setting, Participants: This was an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients encountered from March 16 to April 16, 2020 at the University of Chicago. Deidentified data were obtained from an institutional data warehouse. Group comparisons and logistic regression modeling based on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic testing was performed. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab testing and clinical management was at the discretion of treating physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included incident CV manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of overall cardiology service utilization. Results: During the 30 day study period, 1008 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 689 had available encounter data. Of these, 596 (87%) were AA and 356 (52%) were hospitalized, of which 319 (90%) were AA. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, BMI >40 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) were more common in hospitalized patients. Age > 60 years, tobacco use, CAD, and AF were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality along with several elevated initial laboratory markers including troponin, NT-proBNP, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin. Despite this, cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 were uncommon, coincident with a 69% decrease in cardiology service utilization. For hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4-11.9 days) and mortality was 13%. AA patients were more commonly hospitalized, but without increased mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this AA-predominant experience from south metropolitan Chicago, CV comorbidities and chronic diseases were highly prevalent and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality. Insulin-requiring DM and CKD emerged as novel predictors for hospitalization. Despite the highest rate of comorbidities reported to date, CV manifestations of COVID-19 and mortality were relatively low. The unexpectedly low rate of mortality merits further study.","output":"Outcomes and Cardiovascular Comorbidities in a Predominantly African-American Population with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE ADDRESSED: Physical activity is lower and rates of preventable common diseases are higher in regional/rural than urban Australia. Active commuting (walking/bicycling to get from one place to another) may benefit health through increased physical activity, but most evidence of its correlates come from urban studies. This study aimed to investigate associations between active commuting, socio-demographic characteristics, behaviours, total physical activity and health in a regional/rural Australian state. METHODS: This study used data from the 2016 Tasmanian Population Health Survey, a representative cross-sectional self-report survey of 6,300 adults in Tasmania, Australia. Logistic regression modelling investigated associations between socio-demographic, behavioural and health characteristics and past week active commuting frequency. RESULTS: In multivariable models, being younger, having tertiary qualifications, living in a socio-economically advantaged area, being physically active, having a healthy body mass index, and good/excellent self-rated health were associated with engaging in more active commuting. Inner regional dwellers were no more likely than outer regional dwellers to actively commute after covariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote active commuting in regional/rural areas might consider targeting older adults, those less educated, those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, those less physically active, those with poorer health, and those with higher body mass index. Research could further investigate why these groups appear to be less active for commuting purposes.

The patients diagnosed with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus between April 1, 2020, and April 1, 2021, were included in the study. The rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reactivity-positivity was investigated. The pandemic period was compared with the same period of the pre-pandemic 2 years in terms of number of new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, rate of presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis, and degree of diabetic ketoacidosis severity. RESULTS In total, 56 patients were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus during the pandemic and 2 (3.57%) of them tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction. The number of new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus patients was 39 in 2019 and 39 in 2018. The rate of presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis was similar in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic periods (53.5% in 2020 vs. 56.4% in 2019 and 53.8% in 2018; P = .94).

METHODS: Eighty patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Two sets of fixed and moving computed tomography images acquired from each patient were input into the DL segmentation model to generate nine anatomic regions of interest (ROIs) separately and automatically. The ROIs generated in moving images were transferred to the fixed images using the registration transformation metric. The registration evaluation indexes, including the Dice similarity coefficient, derived from 60 well-registrated cases were then used to develop criteria for decision making. A double-blind study was performed to test the proposed method on quality assurance (QA) for image registration on a new test data set of 20 cases. RESULTS: The values of evaluation indexes generated by our automated evaluation method were quite consistent with those from the manual method; however, the proposed method could save about 116 min per patient on average. The QA method achieved promising image registration error detection, with the following metrics for the nine ROIs: balanced accuracy, 0.946  0.029; sensitivity, 0.959  0.021; and specificity, 0.933  0.050.

The patient experience questionnaire was built into video sessions and completed online, using the Attend Anywhere (AA) platform from July 2020 to March 2021. A Trust-wide clinician views and experiences survey was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS (version 27.0).ResultOf 1,296 patients who completed the online feedback, the majority provided positive feedback for all aspects of video care. Most patients felt their needs were met (90%) and were supported (93%) during the video call. Positive experiences were informed by clinicians communication skills. For future appointments, just over half (51.7%) of patients preferred using video calls, followed by face-to-face (33%). Future video preference was informed by reasons reducing social anxiety and practical aspects such as child/carer needs, physical disability and travel.Of 252 clinicians completing the survey, 161 (64.7%) had used video for remote care delivery. Clinicians also provided positive feedback, with Microsoft-teams as the preferred platform. Most clinicians felt the therapeutic relationship (76.4%) and privacy (78.7%) were maintained using video. While 73% felt there were no safeguarding issues that impacted adversely, 30% felt that care quality was affected, and (69.9%) reported limited visual cues for video calls. Most clinicians (73%) felt confident about clinical decision-making remotely, though there were areas where clinicians felt less confident, such as assessing patients appearance and behaviour.

Hyperinflammation contributes to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by a multi-organ dysfunction. Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 include arrhythmias, myocardial damage, acute heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can be used to assess cardiovascular structure and function non-invasively. Purpose: To investigate the association between NLR at admission and TTE abnormalities in hospitalised adults with COVID-19. Methods: This single-centre retrospective study was conducted at a COVID-19 referral hospital in Indonesia. All consecutive hospitalised adults with confirmed COVID-19 who underwent TTE assessments between 3 April 2020 to 6 April 2021 were included. Comprehensive data including NLR at admission, demographics, co-morbidities, peak severity of COVID-19, and TTE parameters were extracted from electronic medical records. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimal NLR cut-off for prediction of severe-critical COVID-19. Patients with high and low NLR were compared using the chi-square test and odds ratios (OR), with a confidence level of 95%. Results: A total of 487 patients were included in this study. From ROC curve analysis, the area under curve was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76-0.84). The optimal NLR cut-off was determined as 4.42, which predicted severe-critical COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 74.5% and a specificity of 74.6%. Based on this, the low NLR and high NLR groups had 223 and 264 patients, respectively. Male sex, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease occurred more frequently in the high NLR group (P < 0.05). On TTE assessment, the high NLR group had higher odds of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (OR: 2.49;95% CI: 1.14-5.45), LV wall motion abnormalities (OR: 2.62;95% CI: 1.41-4.87), valve abnormalities (OR: 2.04;95% CI: 1.35-3.07), and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (OR: 10.55;95% CI: 2.46-45.25). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with a high NLR at admission had higher odds of abnormal TTE findings, including LV systolic dysfunction, LV wall motion abnormalities, valve abnormalities, and RV dysfunction.

A total of 94% reported reduced contact with family and friends. Over 90% remained active during the pandemic. However, 55% of people with PD showed subjectively lower level of activity then before the pandemic. Moreover, 36% of the respondents felt afraid to visit a doctor and reported problems with access to medication. Subjective QoL reduction was reported by 80%, and 83% declared worsening of PD symptoms. The post pandemic deterioration of motor symptoms in people with PD did not affect their QoL. However, the deterioration of contacts and feelings of isolation had a significant impact on the decline in quality of life (p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively) and the presence of anxiety (p = 0.035 and p = 0.007, respectively). These results may indicate than greater importance of social and mental factors than fitness and health-related factors in the QoL self-assessment of the people with PD.","output":"Secondary Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on People with Parkinsons DiseaseResults of a Polish Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to investigate how mass media in Korea dealt with various issues arising from COVID-19 and the implications of this on statistics education in South Korea during the recent pandemic.

Here we show therapeutic antibody ADG20 is able to neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) including Omicron (B.1.1.529) as well as other SARS-related coronaviruses. We delineate the structural basis of this relatively escape-resistant epitope that extends from one end of the receptor binding site (RBS) into the highly conserved CR3022 site. ADG20 can then benefit from high potency through direct competition with ACE2 in the more variable RBS and interaction with the more highly conserved CR3022 site. Importantly, antibodies that are able to target this site generally neutralize all VOCs, albeit with reduced potency against Omicron. Thus, this highly conserved and vulnerable site can be exploited for design of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.","output":"A broad and potent neutralization epitope in SARS-related coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying the mental health problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothetically, perceived stress and alexithymia may be factors involved in the mental distress response to the pandemic; however, this remains largely unstudied. This study aims to explore the moderating role of alexithymia and the moderated mediation effects of perceived stress on the mental health change due to the pandemic. METHODS: The conditional process model was used to examine the moderated mediation. The sample consists of 659 parents from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study who completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) at 6 months after delivery, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) at 2 or 4 years postpartum between 2014 and 2019; and a questionnaire for pandemic events, a brief 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and the follow-up EPDS/SCL-90 in 2020 after 3 months from the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. RESULTS: Alexithymia moderated the perceived stress-mediated relations between the pandemic events and the changes of depressive and anxiety symptoms through enhancing the detrimental effect of perceived stress on mental health. LIMITATIONS: This study was mainly limited by the causality and generalizability of the findings.

Drugs with potential to interfere with nsp7s have not been described yet.

Further predictive analysis of their physiological/toxicity ADMET criteria (chemical properties, adsorption, metabolism, toxicity) narrowed top-leads to a few drug-like ligands, most of them showing steroid-like structures closely related to some of those being actually used in clinical work. A final optimization by search for structural similarities to the drug-like top-lead, yielded a collection of novel steroid-like ligands with ~100-fold higher-affinity whose antiviral activity may be experimentally validated since they are available.

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, P=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, P<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased.

Despite focused efforts to achieve this balance, the frequency of both thrombotic and bleeding events remains high. Anticoagulation is complicated to manage in this population due to the complexities of the hemostatic system that are compounded by age-related developmental hemostatic changes, variable effects of the etiology of critical illness on hemostasis, and blood-circuit interaction. Lack of high-quality data to guide anticoagulation management in ECMO patients results in marked practice variability among centers. One aspect of anticoagulation therapy that is particularly challenging is the use of antithrombin (AT) supplementation for heparin resistance. This is especially controversial in the neonatal and pediatric population due to the baseline higher risk of bleeding in this cohort. The indication for AT supplementation is further compounded by the potential inaccuracy of the diagnosis of heparin resistance based on the standard laboratory parameters used to assess heparin effect. With concerns regarding the adverse impact of bleeding and thrombosis, clinicians and institutions are faced with making difficult, real-time decisions aimed at optimizing anticoagulation in this setting.

National and international bodies, including the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control Prevention, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, directed enormous efforts to present the latest evidence-based practices to healthcare institutions and communities. The first hospitals that were affected in China and the United States (US) did heroic work in assisting their colleagues with best practices they had acquired. Despite these resources, many US hospitals struggled with how to best incorporate and implement this new information into disaster plans, and many protocol changes had to be established de novo. In general, disaster planning for OB units lagged behind other disaster planning performed by specialties such as emergency medicine, trauma, and pediatrics. PARTICIPANTS: Fortunately, two pre-existing collaborative disaster groups, the OB Disaster Planning Workgroup and the Western Regional Alliance for Pediatric Emergency Management, were able to rapidly deploy during the pandemic due to their pre-established networks and shared goals. MAIN OUTCOME: These groups were able to share best practices, identify and address knowledge gaps, and disseminate information on a broad scale. The case will be made that the OB community needs to establish more such regional and national disaster committees that meet year-round. This will ensure that in times of urgency, these groups can increase the cadence of their meetings, and thus rapidly disperse time-sensitive policies and procedures for OB units nationwide.

The RBD is very immunogenic; it is a major SCV neutralization determinant and can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies capable of out-competing ACE2. However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated. By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-? resolution. The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376C381 and 503C512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511). Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD. The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding 6C7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491). These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines. The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.","output":"Structure of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Receptor-binding Domain Complexed with Neutralizing Antibody,"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, also called Morquio A syndrome) is caused by a deficiency of N\\\\acetylglucosamine\\\\6\\\\sulfate sulfatase (GALNS) and results in skeletal dysplasia symptoms such as short stature and abnormal gait.

Some clinicians have also claimed drinking small volumes of pickle juice effectively relieves acute EAMCs, often alleviating them within 35 seconds. Others fear ingesting pickle juice will enhance dehydration-induced hypertonicity, thereby prolonging dehydration. OBJECTIVE To determine if ingesting small quantities of pickle juice, a carbohydrate-electrolyte (CHO-e) drink, or water increases plasma electrolytes or other selected plasma variables. DESIGN Crossover study. SETTING Exercise physiology laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Nine euhydrated, healthy men (age = 25 +/- 2 years, height = 179.4 +/- 7.2 cm, mass = 86.3 +/- 15.9 kg) completed the study. INTERVENTION(S) Resting blood samples were collected preingestion (-0.5 minutes); immediately postingestion (0 minutes); and at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes postingestion of 1 mL/kg body mass of pickle juice, CHO-e drink, or tap water. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma potassium concentration, plasma osmolality, and changes in plasma volume were analyzed. Urine specific gravity, osmolality, and volume were also measured to characterize hydration status. RESULTS Mean fluid intake was 86.3 +/- 16.7 mL. Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma osmolality, and plasma volume did not change during the 60 minutes after ingestion of each fluid (P >or= .05). Water ingestion slightly decreased plasma potassium concentration at 60 minutes (0.21 +/- 0.14 mg/dL [0.21 +/- 0.14 mmol/L]; P <or= .05). CONCLUSIONS At these volumes, ingestion of pickle juice and CHO-e drink did not cause substantial changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations, plasma osmolality, or plasma volume in rested, euhydrated men. Concern that ingesting these volumes of pickle juice might exacerbate an athlete's risk of dehydration-induced hypertonicity may be unwarranted.

However, the mechanism of base flipping in RNA remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of atomistic details on complex rearrangements in neighboring bases. In this work, we applied transition path sampling (TPS) methods to study base flipping in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule that is known to interact with RNA-editing enzymes through this mechanism. We obtained an ensemble of 1000 transition trajectories to describe the base-flipping process. We used the likelihood maximization method to determine the refined reaction coordinate (RC) consisting of two collective variables (CVs), a distance and a dihedral angle between nucleotides that form stacking interactions with the flipping base. The free energy profile projected along the refined RC revealed three minima, two corresponding to the initial and final states and one for a metastable state. We suggest that the metastable state likely represents a wobbled conformation of nucleobases observed in NMR studies that is often characterized as the flipped state. The analyses of reactive trajectories further revealed that the base flipping is coupled to a global conformational change in a stem-loop of dsRNA.","output":"Reaction Coordinate and Thermodynamics of Base Flipping in RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Kinetic military units operate in austere training environments and deprivation not commonly experienced by competitive athletes. Nutritional strategies to protect against decrements in performance and potential injury risk may differ for these two groups. A cross sectional analysis was conducted to determine energy and macronutrient characteristics associated with performance metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 male subjects (age: 28.4  6.0 years, height: 178.3  6.7 cm, mass: 84.3  9.4 kg, 8.5  5.8 years of service) assigned to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command completed a 1-day performance assessment. Body mass, lean body mass, fat mass (FM), aerobic capacity (VO2max), lactate inflection point (LT), anaerobic power, anaerobic capacity, knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength outcome values were recorded. Dietary intake was collected using automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24). Performance assessment scores were compared with macronutrient intake and controlled for energy intake using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Differences in knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength were significant across low (LPRO), medium (MPRO), and high (HPRO) protein intake groups (p < 0.05) with LPRO performance metrics significantly lower than both MPRO and HPRO and MPRO significantly lower than HPRO. FM was significantly higher in LPRO than MPRO or HPRO (p < 0.05). Low carbohydrate intake (LCHO) was associated with greater body mass and FM compared with high (HCHO) (p < 0.05). There was no association between fat intake and any variable. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in protein intake may have beneficial performance effects independent of total energy intake, while moderate increases in carbohydrate intake may not be sufficient to enhance physical performance in a special operations population.","output":"Military Protein Intake Related to Strength and Fat Mass Independent of Energy Intake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Wide disparities in health status exist in the United States across race and ethnicity, broadly driven by social determinants of healthmost notably race and ethnic group differences in income, education, and occupational status. However, disparities in disease frequency or severity remain underappreciated for many individual diseases whose distribution in the population varies. Such information is not readily accessible, nor emphasized in treatment guidelines or reviews used by practitioners. Specifically, a summary on disease-specific evidence of disparities from population-based studies is lacking. Our goal was to summarize the published evidence for specific disease disparities in the United States so that this knowledge becomes more widely available at the bedside. We hope this summary stimulates health equity research at the disease level so that these disparities can be addressed effectively. Methods: A targeted literature review of disorders in Pfizers current pipeline was conducted. The 38 diseases included metabolic disorders, cancers, inflammatory conditions, dermatologic disorders, rare diseases, and infectious targets of vaccines under development. Online searches in Ovid and Google were performed to identify sources focused on differences in disease rates and severity between non-Hispanic Whites and Black/African Americans, and between non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics. As a model for how this might be accomplished for all disorders, disparities in disease rates and disease severity were scored to make the results of our review most readily accessible. After primary review of each condition by one author, another undertook an independent review. Differences between reviewers were resolved through discussion. Results: For Black/African Americans, 29 of the 38 disorders revealed a robust excess in incidence, prevalence, or severity. After sickle cell anemia, the largest excesses in frequency were identified for multiple myeloma and hidradenitis suppurativa. For Hispanics, there was evidence of disparity in 19 diseases. Most notable were metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Conclusions: This review summarized recent disease-specific evidence of disparities based on race and ethnicity across multiple diseases, to inform clinicians and health equity research. Our findings may be well known to researchers and specialists in their respective fields but may not be common knowledge to health care providers or public health and policy institutions. Our hope is that this effort spurs research into the causes of the many disease disparities that exist in the United States.","output":"Disease-Specific Health Disparities: A Targeted Review Focusing on Race and Ethnicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The factors affecting COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity have been widely discussed.

Data from Europe (country-wise) and the USA (state-wise) were investigated separately. We found statistically significant positive correlations between the VCR and reported COVID-19 incidence, as well as mortality for Europe and the USA. A statistically significant positive correlation was also found between the VCR and the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for Europe. For the USA, the VCR/CFR correlation was not statistically significant.

Methods: Telemonitoring protocol included phone calls and e-mails. Patients were asked to rate COVID-19-like symptoms, psychological symptoms, epidemiological issues, and adherence to diabetes management (insulin, exercise, and diet) using a 0-to-10 scale. An e-mail address and phone number were offered for further contact if needed. Clinical, demographic, and laboratorial data from the consultations before the pandemic were collected from medical records. Results: Among 321 patients with a previously scheduled consultation over the first 15 weeks of social distancing, 237 (73.8%) could be successfully contacted. Of these, 207 (87.3%) were exclusively evaluated by telemonitoring (190 only by phone or text message and 17 who were also reached by email), and 30 (12.7%) patients attended the consultation for medical reasons detected during the telephone screening. Overall, 44 (18.5%) patients reported COVID-19-like symptoms. One (2.3%) patient was hospitalized and subsequently died.

We aimed to estimate rates of hypertension ATC in the older population and to assess differences in these rates across sociodemographic groups and states in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a nationally representative survey of individuals aged 45 years and over and their spouses in all Indian states (except one) in 2017 to 2018. We identified hypertension by blood pressure (BP) measurement 140/90 mm Hg or self-reported diagnosis if also taking medication or observing salt/diet restriction to control BP. We distinguished those who (i) reported diagnosis (aware); (ii) reported taking medication or being under salt/diet restriction to control BP (treated); and (iii) had measured systolic BP <140 and diastolic BP <90 (controlled). We estimated ageCsex adjusted hypertension prevalence and rates of ATC by consumption quintile, education, age, sex, urbanCrural, caste, religion, marital status, living arrangement, employment status, health insurance, and state. We used concentration indices to measure socioeconomic inequalities and multivariable logistic regression to estimate fully adjusted differences in these outcomes. Study limitations included reliance on BP measurement on a single occasion, missing measurements of BP for some participants, and lack of data on nonadherence to medication. The 64,427 participants in the analysis sample had a median age of 57 years: 58% were female, and 70% were rural dwellers. We estimated hypertension prevalence to be 41.9% (95% CI 41.0 to 42.9). Among those with hypertension, we estimated that 54.4% (95% CI 53.1 to 55.7), 50.8% (95% CI 49.5 to 52.0), and 28.8% (95% CI 27.4 to 30.1) were aware, treated, and controlled, respectively. Across states, adjusted rates of ATC ranged from 27.5% (95% CI 22.2 to 32.8) to 75.9% (95% CI 70.8 to 81.1), from 23.8% (95% CI 17.6 to 30.1) to 74.9% (95% CI 69.8 to 79.9), and from 4.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 8.1) to 41.9% (95% CI 36.8 to 46.9), respectively. AgeCsex adjusted rates were lower (p < 0.001) in poorer, less educated, and socially disadvantaged groups, as well as for males, rural residents, and the employed. Among individuals with hypertension, the richest fifth were 8.5 percentage points (pp) (95% CI 5.3 to 11.7; p < 0.001), 8.9 pp (95% CI 5.7 to 12.0; p < 0.001), and 7.1 pp (95% CI 4.2 to 10.1; p < 0.001) more likely to be aware, treated, and controlled, respectively, than the poorest fifth. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension prevalence was high, and ATC of the condition were low among older adults in India. Inequalities in these indicators pointed to opportunities to target hypertension management more effectively and equitably on socially disadvantaged groups.","output":"Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in adults aged 45 years and over and their spouses in India: A nationally representative cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterise the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).

Cases were identified by three testing strategies: targeted testing guided by clinical suspicion, open invitation population screening based on self referral, and random population screening. All identified cases were enrolled in a telehealth monitoring service, and symptoms were systematically monitored from diagnosis to recovery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of one or more of 19 predefined symptoms during follow-up. RESULTS: Among 1564 people positive for SARS-CoV-2, the most common presenting symptoms were myalgia (55%), headache (51%), and non-productive cough (49%). At the time of diagnosis, 83 (5.3%) individuals reported no symptoms, of whom 49 (59%) remained asymptomatic during follow-up.

Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected. Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calf-level risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born. Factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth, and the birth of a calf in the summer as opposed to winter. Calves shedding C. parvum oocysts had 5.3 (95% CI 4.4, 6.4) times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves, controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model. Furthermore, infected calves shedding more than 2.2  10(5) oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 4.8, 7.8). The odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth.","output":"Calf-level risk factors for neonatal diarrhea and shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum in Ontario dairy calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-Melanoma Differentiation-Associated gene 5 (MDA-5) Dermatomyositis (MDA5, DM) is a recently identified subtype of myositis characteristically associated with Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease (RP-ILD) and unique cutaneous features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of adult acute cholecystitis admissions (January 1,2020-May 31, 2020). Corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 comprised the historical control. Difference-in-differences analysis compared biweekly cholecystitis admissions pre- and postdeclaration in 2020 to the historical control. Odds of increased severity of disease presentation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Cholecystitis admissions decreased 48.7% from 5.2 to 2.67 cases (RR 0.51 [0.28,0.96], P = 0.04) following pandemic declaration when comparing 2020 to historical control (P = 0.02).

CONCLUSIONS: Postpandemic declaration we experienced a significant decrease in cholecystitis admissions without corresponding increases in disease severity. The pandemic impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors, with fewer mild presentations.

Recent availability in treatment for DMD raised the need of early diagnosis, and DMD became as a selective item of newborn screening (NBS) since Feb. 2021 in our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried blood spots (DBS) muscle-type creatine kinase (CK) isoform was measured with a commercialized kit with age-adjusted cutoffs. Subjects with an elevation of CK in the first screen were requested for a re-screen 2 weeks later. A DBS whole-exome sequencing (WES) panel for dystrophin and other neuromuscular-related genes was applied to confirm the diagnosis for subjects with persistent hyperCKemia. RESULTS: During a 1-year period, 50,572 newborns (male 26,130) received DMD screening at a mean age of 2 days (SD 1 day). Among them, 632 (1.2%) had an elevated CK value. A re-screen at a mean age of 14 days (SD 8 days) revealed 14 subjects with persistent hyperCKemia, and DMD was confirmed in 3 of them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients from eight international TeleCheck-AF centers were asked to complete an app-based 10-item questionnaire related to risk factors, associated conditions and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-score components. Patient's medical history was retrieved from electronic health records (EHR). RESULTS: Among 994 patients, 954 (96%) patients (38% female, median age 65 years) completed the questionnaire and were included in this analysis. The accuracy of self-reported assessment was highest for pacemaker and anticoagulation treatment and lowest for heart failure and arrhythmias. Patients who knew that AF increases the stroke risk, more often had a 100% or 80% correlation between EHR- and app-based results compared to those who did not know (27 vs. 14% or 84 vs. 77%, P = 0.001). Thromboembolic events were more often reported in app (vs. EHR) in all countries, whereas higher self-reported hypertension and anticoagulant treatment were observed in Germany and heart failure in the Netherlands.

It uses double- or multiple-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes to remove protein aggregates and damaged organelles from the cytoplasm for recycling. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy to enhance its own replication. Here we describe a procedure that combines membrane flotation and affinity chromatography for the purification of autophagosomes from cells that harbor an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The purified autophagosomes had double- or multiple-membrane structures with a diameter ranging from 200 nm to 600 nm. The analysis of proteins associated with HCV-induced autophagosomes by proteomics led to the identification of HCV nonstructural proteins as well as proteins involved in membrane trafficking. Notably, caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and annexin A2, which are proteins associated with lipid rafts, were also identified. The association of lipid rafts with HCV-induced autophagosomes was confirmed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Their association with autophagosomes was also confirmed in HCV-infected cells. The association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes was specific to HCV, as it was not detected in autophagosomes induced by nutrient starvation. Further analysis indicated that the autophagosomes purified from HCV replicon cells could mediate HCV RNA replication in a lipid raft-dependent manner, as the depletion of cholesterol, a major component of lipid rafts, from autophagosomes abolished HCV RNA replication. Our studies thus demonstrated that HCV could specifically induce the association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes for its RNA replication.IMPORTANCE HCV can cause severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is one of the most important human pathogens. Infection with HCV can lead to the reorganization of membrane structures in its host cells, including the induction of autophagosomes. In this study, we developed a procedure to purify HCV-induced autophagosomes and demonstrated that HCV could induce the localization of lipid rafts to autophagosomes to mediate its RNA replication. This finding provided important information for further understanding the life cycle of HCV and its interaction with the host cells.","output":"Hepatitis C Virus Induces the Localization of Lipid Rafts to Autophagosomes for Its RNA Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyloid formation is associated with multiple amyloidosis diseases. Human calcitonin (hCT) is a typical amyloidogenic peptide, its aggregation is associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC), and also limits its clinical application. Magnolia officinalis is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine; its two major polyphenol components, magnolol (Mag) and honokiol (Hon), have displayed multiple functions. Polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. However, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as Mag and Hon has not been reported. In this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hCT aggregation. We found that Mag and Hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hCT, whereas Mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hCT aggregates. Further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested Mag and Hon suppressed the aggregation of hCT both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while MTT-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that Mag and Hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hCT aggregates. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated Mag and Hon both interact with hCT. Together, our study suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of these two compounds and their structure related derivatives.","output":"Inhibitory effects of magnolol and honokiol on human calcitonin aggregation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Offshore decommissioning activities are expected to increase as oil and gas subsea infrastructure becomes obsolete. Decisions on decommissioning alternatives will benefit from quantifying and understanding the marine communities associated with these structures. As a case study, fish assemblages associated with an inshore network of subsea pipelines located on the North West shelf of Western Australia were compared to those in surrounding natural reef and soft sediment habitats using remotely operated vehicles fitted with a stereo-video system (stereo-ROVs). The number of species, the abundance, biomass, feeding guild composition and the economic value of fishes were compared among habitats. The community composition of fish associated with pipelines was distinct from those associated with natural habitats, and was characterised by a greater abundance and/or biomass of fish from higher trophic levels (e.g. piscivores, generalist carnivores and invertivores), including many species considered to be of value to commercial and recreational fishers. Biomass of fish on pipelines was, on average, 20 times greater than soft sediments, and was similar to natural reefs. However, the biomass of species considered important to fisheries recorded on the pipelines was, on average 3.5 times greater than reef and 44.5 times greater than soft sediment habitats.

Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and an important burden on healthcare systems worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to identify severity predictors in the oldest-old admitted with influenza and/or RSV infections. This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all oldest-old patients (&#8805; 85 years old) admitted for laboratory-confirmed influenza and/or RSV infection in three tertiary hospitals in Portugal, Italy, and Cyprus over two consecutive winter seasons. The outcomes included the following: pneumonia on infection presentation, use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and in-hospital death (IHD). The association with possible predictors, including clinical features and type of virus infection, was assessed using uni- and multivariable analyses. A total of 251 oldest-old patients were included in the study. Pneumonia was evident in 32.3% (n = 81). NIV was implemented in 8.8% (n = 22), and IHD occurred in 13.9% (n = 35). Multivariable analyses revealed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma was associated with pneumonia (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.02-3.43; p = 0.045). COPD or asthma (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.67-11.6; p = 0.003), RSV (OR 3.12; 95% CI 1.09-8.92; p = 0.023), and influenza B infections (OR 3.77; 95% CI 1.06-13.5; p = 0.041) were associated with NIV use, respectively, while chronic kidney disease was associated with IHD (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.14-5.51; p = 0.023). Among the oldest-old, chronic organ failure, such as COPD or asthma, and CKD predicted pneumonia and IHD, respectively, beyond the importance of viral virulence itself. These findings could impact on public health policies, such as fostering influenza immunization campaigns, home-based care programs, and end-of-life care.

Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic RNA synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of RNA-processing enzymes that are not found in most other RNA virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities. SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5'-to-3' direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded RNA and DNA. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([dNTPase) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity for the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5' cap structure of viral RNAs. The data suggest that the (d)NTPase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.","output":"Multiple enzymatic activities associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The olive oil industry is subject to significant fraudulent practices that can lead to serious economic implications and even affect consumer health. Therefore, many analytical strategies have been developed for olive oil's geographic authentication, including multi-elemental and isotopic analyses. In the first part of this review, the range of multi-elemental concentrations recorded in olive oil from the main olive oil-producing countries is discussed. The compiled data from the literature indicates that the concentrations of elements are in comparable ranges overall. They can be classified into three categories, with (1) Rb and Pb well below 1 g kg-1; (2) elements such as As, B, Mn, Ni, and Sr ranging on average between 10 and 100 g kg-1; and (3) elements including Cr, Fe, and Ca ranging between 100 to 10,000 g kg-1. Various sample preparations, detection techniques, and statistical data treatments were reviewed and discussed. Results obtained through the selected analytical approaches have demonstrated a strong correlation between the multi-elemental composition of the oil and that of the soil in which the plant grew. The review next focused on the limits of olive oil authentication using the multi-elemental composition method. Finally, different methods based on isotopic signatures were compiled and critically assessed. Stable isotopes of light elements have provided acceptable segregation of oils from different origins for years already. More recently, the determination of stable isotopes of strontium has proven to be a reliable tool in determining the geographical origin of food products. The ratio 87Sr/86Sr is stable over time and directly related to soil geology; it merits further study and is likely to become part of the standard tool kit for olive oil origin determination, along with a combination of different isotopic approaches and multi-elemental composition.","output":"Olive Oil Traceability Studies Using Inorganic and Isotopic Signatures: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Cerebrovascular prevalence is high in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) However, whether racial disparities exist among this population have not been systematically explored METHODS We performed a retrospective study to assess the prevalence of stroke stratified by race among patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 who visited emergency department (ED) up to August 13, 2020 in the United States (US) We used multivariable logistic regression to compare the odds of stroke in Black patients with COVID-19 compared to their non-black counterpart while adjusting for the major potential confounders RESULTS Among 8815 patients with ED visits with COVID-19, 77, 0 87 %, 95% confidence interval CI (95% CI): 0 69% to 1 10%) had ischemic stroke The mean age of patients with stroke was 64 years (SD: 2 years);28 (43%) were men, 55 (71%) had hypertension, and 29 (50%) were black The prevalence of ischemic stroke in Blacks, Whites non-Hispanics and White Hispanics was 1 26 (95% CI: 0 86 to 1 83), 0 84 % (95% CI: 0 51% to 1 37%) and 0 49% (95% CI: 0 26% to 0 88%) respectively After adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, drinking and smoking, the likelihood of stroke was higher in Black than non-black patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2 76;95% CI, 1 13-7 15, p=0 03) CONCLUSIONS Racial disparities in the prevalence of stroke among patients with COVID-19 exist, higher in Black population","output":"Racial Disparities in Ischemic Stroke among Patients with COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A respiratory illness has been spreading rapidly in China, since its outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province in December 2019.

Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively.

We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age 65 years) and non-elderly (age&lt;65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality. All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes. One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.8419.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection across Virginia and the risk factors associated with infection after the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this statewide cross-sectional surveillance study, 4675 adult outpatients presenting for health care not associated with COVID-19 in Virginia between June 1 and August 14, 2020, were recruited to participate in a questionnaire and receive venipuncture to assess SARS-CoV-2 serology. Eligibility was stratified to meet age, race, and ethnicity quotas that matched regional demographic profiles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as measured by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G assay. RESULTS: Among 4675 adult outpatients (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.9] years; 3119 women [66.7%]; 3098 White [66.3%] and 4279 non-Hispanic [91.5%] individuals) presenting for nonCCOVID-19Cassociated health care across Virginia, the weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.8%-3.1%) and ranged from 0% to 20% by zip code. Seroprevalence was notably higher among participants who were Hispanic (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.1%-14.3%), residing in the northern region (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.8%-6.1%), aged 40 to 49 years (4.4%; 95% CI, 1.8%-7.1%), and uninsured (5.9%; 95% CI, 1.5%-10.3%). Higher seroprevalence was associated with Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.56; 95% CI, 1.76-7.21), residence in a multifamily unit (aOR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.25-5.22), and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection (aOR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.77-10.58). The sensitivity of serology results was 94% (95% CI, 70%-100%) among those who reported receiving a previous polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 infection. Among 101 participants with seropositive results, 67 individuals (66.3%) were estimated to have asymptomatic infection. These data suggested a total estimated COVID-19 burden that was 2.8-fold higher than that ascertained by PCR-positive case counts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This large statewide serologic study estimated that 2.4% of adults in Virginia had exposure to SARS-CoV-2, which was 2.8-fold higher than confirmed case counts. Hispanic ethnicity, residence in a multifamily unit, and contact with an individual with confirmed COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors associated with exposure.

However, as biometric solutions are extensively deployed, it will be common to replace acquisition hardware as it is damaged or newer designs appear or to exchange information between agencies or applications operating in different environments. Furthermore, variations in imaging spectral bands can also occur. For example, face images are typically acquired in the visible (VIS) spectrum, while iris images are usually captured in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. However, cross-spectrum comparison may be needed if, for example, a face image obtained from a surveillance camera needs to be compared against a legacy database of iris imagery. Here, we propose a multialgorithmic approach to cope with periocular images captured with different sensors. With face masks in the front line to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, periocular recognition is regaining popularity since it is the only region of the face that remains visible. As a solution to the mentioned cross-sensor issues, we integrate different biometric comparators using a score fusion scheme based on linear logistic regression This approach is trained to improve the discriminating ability and, at the same time, to encourage that fused scores are represented by log-likelihood ratios. This allows easy interpretation of output scores and the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision-making since scores from different comparators are in the same probabilistic range. We evaluate our approach in the context of the 1st Cross-Spectral Iris/Periocular Competition, whose aim was to compare person recognition approaches when periocular data from visible and near-infrared images is matched. The proposed fusion approach achieves reductions in the error rates of up to 30%C40% in cross-spectral NIR-VIS comparisons with respect to the best individual system, leading to an EER of 0.2% and a FRR of just 0.47% at FAR = 0.01%. It also represents the best overall approach of the mentioned competition. Experiments are also reported with a database of VIS images from two different smartphones as well, achieving even bigger relative improvements and similar performance numbers. We also discuss the proposed approach from the point of view of template size and computation times, with the most computationally heavy comparator playing an important role in the results.

Stock taking is needed to understand, for example, do we expect our current approaches to deliver greater commitment or do we need to change our approach? Is time the limiting factor for FP2020 commitments or are other, contextual, mechanistic and implementation factors more critical? Methods: This paper uses mini-case studies to offer insights in response to these questions. It drew from country status updates of national FP program commitments published on the FP2020 website. These included country self-assessments, country action for acceleration plans and revitalised commitments using standard templates provided by FP2020. Results: Critical factors emerging from the case study analysis suggest the following. Context: Country programs that adapted best practices through thoughtful selection, regular monitoring, and course correction, were more responsive to context and better able to scale interventions. Mechanism: Programs that embedded commitments within national health reforms and transformative agendas were able to sustain commitment and mechanism more effectively over time. Implementation: Programs that were able to balance central coordination with devolved implementation, more effectively translated commitments to action. Monitoring: Programs that placed emphasis on monitoring progress and course correct were better able to steward national commitments and partner inputs. Conclusions: National FP programs included within the country comparative analysis benefitted from their engagement with FP2020.

We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8(+) T cells (which express 47 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA.

Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.","output":"Retinoic acid facilitates inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus induction of CD8(+) T-cell migration to the porcine gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The successive emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has presented a major challenge in the management of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There are growing concerns regarding the emerging variants escaping vaccines or therapeutic neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we conducted an epidemiological survey to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants that are sporadically proliferating in vaccine-advanced countries. Subsequently, we created HiBiT-tagged virus-like particles displaying spike proteins derived from the variants to analyze the neutralizing efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and several therapeutic antibodies. We found that the Mu variant and a derivative of the Delta strain with E484K and N501Y mutations significantly evaded vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies. This trend was also observed in the Beta and Gamma variants, although they are currently not prevalent. Although 95.2% of the vaccinees exhibited prominent neutralizing activity against the prototype strain, only 73.8 and 78.6% of the vaccinees exhibited neutralizing activity against the Mu and the Delta derivative variants, respectively. A long-term analysis showed that 88.8% of the vaccinees initially exhibited strong neutralizing activity against the currently circulating Delta strain; the number decreased to 31.6% for the individuals at 6 months after vaccination. Notably, these variants were shown to be resistant to several therapeutic antibodies. Our findings demonstrate the differential neutralization efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and monoclonal antibodies against circulating variants, suggesting the need for pandemic alerts and booster vaccinations against the currently prevalent variants.","output":"Molecular and Epidemiological Characterization of Emerging Immune-Escape Variants of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents preliminary summary results from a longitudinal study of participants in seven U.S. states during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Second-year medical students enrolled in this course in 2019 (in-person) and 2020 (online). The attendance rate, satisfaction in the course evaluation survey, and academic achievement on the written final examination were utilized to compare the two different methods of course delivery. The medical students who took the online course were also asked about their preferences regarding the method of course delivery and the advantages and drawbacks of each method of online lectures. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the attendance rate and overall satisfaction between the two groups. The mean score on the written examination of the online course (84.119.6) showed comparable effects to the in-person course (78.018.3). The percentages of students who achieved high performance (55.5%) and the achieved minimum requirement (95.9%) were also maintained compared to the in-person course (14.6% and 93.6%, respectively). Medical students preferred the online course to the in-person course; in particular, they preferred prerecorded videos over live streaming online lectures. CONCLUSION: The participation, satisfaction, and the academic achievement of the online course were comparable to those of the in-person course. However, the greatest drawback of the online course was the lack of interaction between peer learners. Therefore, diverse methods for online education should be considered to increase students sense of belonging to a learning community.","output":"The feasibility and satisfaction of an online global health education course at a single medical school: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We reflect on two museum visiting experiences that adopted the strategy of interpersonalization in which one visitor creates an experience for another.

By reflecting on the design of these experiences and their deployment in museums we show how interpersonalization can deliver engaging social visits in which visitors make their own interpretations. We contrast the approach to previous research in customization and algorithmic personalization. We reveal how these experiences relied on intimacy between pairs of visitors but also between visitors and the museum. We propose that interpersonalization requires museums to step back to make space for interpretation, but that this then raises the challenge of how to reintroduce the museum's own perspective.

It has been increasingly used in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but its efficacy (based on effect size calculations), safety, and stimulation parameters have not been systematically examined. In this systematic review, we aimed to (1) explore the effectiveness of tDCS on the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits of ADHD patients, (2) evaluate the safety of tDCS application, especially in children with ADHD, (3) model the electrical field intensity in the target regions based on the commonly-applied and effective versus less-effective protocols, and (4) discuss and propose advanced tDCS parameters. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach, a literature search identified 14 empirical experiments investigating tDCS effects in ADHD. Partial improving effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits (response inhibition, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility) or clinical symptoms (e.g., impulsivity and inattention) are reported in 10 studies. No serious adverse effects are reported in 747 sessions of tDCS. The left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are the regions most often targeted, and anodal tDCS the protocol most often applied. An intensity of 2 mA induced stronger electrical fields than 1 mA in adults with ADHD and was associated with significant behavioral changes. In ADHD children, however, the electrical field induced by 1 mA, which is likely larger than the electrical field induced by 1 mA in adults due to the smaller head size of children, was sufficient to result in significant behavioral change. Overall, tDCS seems to be a promising method for improving ADHD deficits. However, the clinical utility of tDCS in ADHD cannot yet be concluded and requires further systematic investigation in larger sample sizes. Cortical regions involved in ADHD pathophysiology, stimulation parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode size), and types of symptom/deficit are potential determinants of tDCS efficacy in ADHD. Developmental aspects of tDCS in childhood ADHD should be considered as well.","output":"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in ADHD: A Systematic Review of Efficacy, Safety, and Protocol-induced Electrical Field Modeling Results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Negative portrayals in the Australian media situate teachers as a problem and teaching as a deficit practice.

Caesarian-derived colostrum-deprived pigs were inoculated intratracheally with one of the three viruses. SIV infection was followed within 1 day post inoculation (d PI ) by characteristic respiratory and general signs, and excessive lung epithelial desquamation and neutrophil infiltration (38 to 56 per cent of BAL cells at 1 d PI vs 0 to 1 per cent in controls). High concentrations of bioactive interferon- ( IFN -), tumour necrosis factor- ( TNF -) and interleukin-1 ( IL -1) coincided with peak symptoms and neutrophil infiltration. PRCV infection was asymptomatic and produced a mild bronchointerstitial pneumonitis and neutrophil infiltration (13 to 22 per cent of BAL cells at 4 d PI ). IFN - titres parallelled those found during SIV infection, TNF - was negligible and IL -1 undetectable. PRRSV infection induced anorexia and lethargy between 3 and 5 d PI . There was marked infiltration with mononuclear cells in alveolar septa and BAL fluids between 7 and 10 d PI , while neutrophils remained at less than 11 per cent of BAL cells at any time. IL -1 was produced from three throughout 10 d PI , while IFN - production was minimal and TNF - undetectable.

METHODS Patients from the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) registry with onset-to-door-time 4 hours, acute cervicocerebral computed tomographic angiography, a premorbid modified Rankin Scale 2, and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >4 were selected. Patients with significant intracranial arterial obstruction (50%-99%) and undergoing acute endovascular treatment were excluded. An interaction analysis of IVT and initial arterial occlusion for favorable 3 months outcome (modified Rankin Scale <3) were performed with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS Among 654 included patients, 382 (58%) showed arterial occlusion, of whom 263 (69%) received IVT. Two hundred seventy-two showed no/minimal obstruction of whom 139 (51%) received IVT. In the adjusted interaction analysis, there was a trend in favor of the arterial occlusion group (odds ratio [OR]=3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-18.97; P=0.08). IVT (versus no IVT) was associated with better outcome in patients with occlusion (adjusted OR for favorable outcome, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.10-8.28) but not in patients with no/minimal obstruction (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.21-2.74). Conversely, patients with occlusion had a similar rate of favorable outcome as no/minimal obstruction when thrombolysed (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.17-1.47) but had a less favorable outcome without thrombolysis (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.44). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, there was a trend for more favorable outcomes with IVT in the setting of initial arterial occlusion than in the setting of no/minimal obstruction.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the safety and efficacy of PGE1 in adults receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-II-pilot trial at two medical intensive care units at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. Adults with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of 5 ng/kg/min PGE1 or placebo (0.9% saline), in addition to standard anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the rate of transfused packed red blood cells per ECMO day. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of and the time to clinically overt bleeding and thromboembolic events. A post-hoc subgroup analysis included only patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: Between September 2016 and April 2021, of 133 screened patients, 50 patients were randomized, of whom 48 received the assigned study medication (24 per group). The transfusion rate was similar between groups (0.41vs.0.39;p=0.733). Prostaglandin E1 was associated with fewer thromboembolic events (7vs.16;p=0.020) and longer thromboembolism-free time (HR 0.302;p=0.01), fewer clinically overt bleeding events (2vs.11;p=0.017), and longer bleeding-free time (HR 0.213;p=0.047). In COVID-19 patients (n=25), the hazard ratios for clinically significant bleeding and thromboembolism were 0.276 (95% CI 0.035-2.186) and 0.521 (95% CI 0.149-1.825), respectively. CONCLUSION: Add-on treatment with PGE1 was safe but did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing the rate of red blood cell transfusions in patients on venovenous ECMO.

For these reasons, Spanish Cancer Association of Madrid (AECCmad), transformed all exercise-oncology programs into online version with the objective of maintaining the exercise attention to the breast cancer patients (BCP). This shows the first results from this adapted intervention, evaluating the effectiveness in physical outcomes as well as the feasibility of the new model. Methodology: Since 1st of September of 2020 a total of 64 patients with breast cancer (BC) in different stages were attended in the exercise-oncology unit of the AECCmad using the online model. Firstly, a specialized nurse checked that all patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria to ensure BCP safeness. After this, all women had a one-to-one interview with the exercise-oncology professionals, face-to-face (F-F) or online, where anthropometrics (weight and high in virtual and bioimpedance in F-F interview) and functional capacity (6 minutes walking test, sit and stand in online interview, and that two as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, maximal strength and bioimpedance in F-F interview) were assessed to individualized exercise interventions. Then, BCP were enrolled in a 8-weeks online program adapted to their characteristics, where a specialist in Sexercise-oncology supervised each session, performing a combined exercise intervention from 50 to 90% of maximal heart rate. At the end, a final assessment was carried out with a twofold purpose: to inform patients of the achieved changes and to give them a personalized final report that would help women to continue exercising. Adherence of the program and physical variables collected in pre-post tests were analyzed. T test of related samples were used to compare pre-post assessments. Results 59 BCP with a mean of 45.7(10.03) years old completed the online program: 31.3% were survivors, 56.7% were under treatment and 12.5% had metastatic disease and 59% of the women had a F-F assessment, while the 41% were online. Related to the feasibility, program adherence was 92.2% (only 5 patients doped out the program) and classes assistance rate was 81%. BCP showed significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (DifMean (M): 8.56 ml.kg.min;CI95% 5.76-11.37;p=0.0001), strength in upper limbs (DifMean:11.38 kg;CI95%: 8.97-13.79;p=0.0001), and in legs (M: 29.37 kg;CI95%: 23.93-34.82;p=0.0001) and in sit and stand test (M: 4.53 squats;CI95%: 2.19-6.88;p=0.0001);and almost significant in distance of six minutes walking test (M: 76.70 meters;CI95%:-4.80-158.21;p=0.064) Conclusions: Exercise-oncology online programs adapted to BCP characteristics are feasible and effective to significantly improve cardiorespiratory fitness and functional capacity. In addition, this type of programs might be a useful tool to achieve a healthy balance in BCP's body composition. This new model of intervention not only presents high levels of adherence, but also, allows patients to access supervised exercise programs that otherwise would not be possible. Online intervention in exercise oncology might be a feasible, safe, and effective tool not only to improve BCP's health but also for other cancer patients, in any stage of cancer.","output":"Effectiveness and feasibility of exercise-oncology programs in breast cancer patients using new technologies adapted to the COVID 19 new normality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When coronavirus began to descend upon the United States, religious freedom advocates across the country sounded the alarm that citizens religious practices and institutions were under threat.

MAD0004J08 is an extremely potent Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) able to neutralise in vitro all current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). This ongoing study, evaluates safety, pharmacokinetics and SARS-CoV-2 sera neutralization effect of MAD0004J08 when administered as single dose intramuscularly in healthy adults. MethodWe conducted a dose escalation study with sequential enrolment of three cohorts, each with an increasing dose level of MAD0004J08 (48mg, 100mg and 400mg). Within each cohort, 10 young healthy adults were randomized with 4:1 ratio to a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of MAD0004J08 or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with severe and/or serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 7 days post-treatment. Secondary endpoints reported in this paper are the proportion of subjects with solicited TEAEs up 7 days post dosing, MAD0004J08 serum concentrations and neutralising activity versus the original SARS-COV-2 Wuhan virus at different timepoints post-dosing. As post-hoc analyses, we compared the sera neutralising titres of subjects who received MAD0004J08 with those of people that had received the COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in the previous sixty days (n=10) and COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=20), and assessed serum neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. FindingsA total of 30 subjects, 10 per cohort, were enrolled and randomized. Data up to 30 days were available and analysed in this report. No severe TEAEs were reported in any of the cohorts in the 7 days post-treatment. MAD0004J08 was detected in the sera of treated subjects within few hours post-administration and reached almost maximal levels on day 8. The geometric mean neutralising titres (GMT) assessed against the original Wuhan virus peaked on day 8 and ranged 226 - 905, 905 - 2,560, and 1,280 - 5,120 for cohort 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The sera neutralising GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects in all the three cohorts were found to be 1{middle dot}5-54{middle dot}5-fold higher compared to sera from convalescent patients and 1{middle dot}83- 76{middle dot}4-fold higher compared to sera from COVID-19 vaccinees. Finally, GMT in MAD0004J08 treated subjects showed high neutralising titres versus the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. InterpretationA single dose administration of MAD0004J08 via i.m. route is safe and well tolerated and results in a rapid systemic distribution of the MAD0004J08 and sera neutralising titres higher than COVID-19 convalescent and vaccinated subjects. A single dose administration of MAD0004J08 is also sufficient to effectively neutralise major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Based on these results, a Phase 2-3 trial is ongoing to further assess the safety, dosage, and efficacy of MAD0004J08 in asymptomatic or mild-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 patients.

Here, we propose a theoretical framework to couple transmission dynamics with behavioural dynamics due to infection awareness. We modelled the dynamics of social behaviour using a game theory framework, which is then coupled with an epidemiological model that captures the disease dynamics by assuming that individuals are aware of the actual epidemiological state to reduce their contacts. Results from the mechanistic model show that as individuals increase their awareness, the steady-state value of the final fraction of infected individuals in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model decreases. We also incorporate theoretical contact networks, having the awareness parameter dependent on global or local contacts.

Owing to the rising number of cases and limited global resources, being able to predict patients with a severe disease course is crucial for the initial allocation of the limited medical resources. This study aimed to identify whether lymphopenia is a reliable prognostic marker for COVID-19 using Korean nationwide cohort. Lymphopenia and its severity levels may serve as reliable predictive factors for COVID-19 clinical outcomes including mortality, needs for intensive care, and oxygen requirements. Current study suggests that lymphopenia at the initial presentation of COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. ABSTRACT: We aimed to identify whether lymphopenia is a reliable prognostic marker for COVID-19. Using data derived from a Korean nationwide longitudinal cohort of 5628 COVID-19 patients, we identified propensity-matched cohorts (n = 770) with group I of severe lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte counts [ALC]: <500/mm(3), n = 110), group II of mild-to-moderate lymphopenia (ALC: 500C<1000/mm(3), n = 330), and group III, no lymphopenia (ALC: 1000/mm(3), n = 330). A significantly higher mortality rate was associated with lymphopenia severity: 40% in group I, 22.7% in group II, and 13.0% in group III (p < 0.001). At 28 days, the estimated inferior overall survival associated with intensified lymphopenia: 62.7% in group I, 79.9% in group II, and 89.0% in group III (p < 0.001). Lymphopenia contributed significantly toward a greater need for interventions in all groups but at varying degrees: requirements of invasive ventilation, intensive oxygen supply, or adequate oxygen supply, respectively (p < 0.001). The lymphopenia intensity was independently associated with higher COVID-19 mortality in multivariable analysis; adjusted odds ratios of 5.63 (95% CI, 3.0C10.72), and 2.47 (95% CI, 1.5C4.13) for group I and group II, respectively. Lymphopenia and its severity levels may serve as reliable predictive factors for COVID-19 clinical outcomes; thus, lymphopenia may provide the prognostic granularity required for clinical use in the management of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Lymphopenia as a Biological Predictor of Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients: A Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate whether abdominal scar characteristics could predict the occurrence of cervical stenosis after abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART), we conducted a retrospective study and investigated the relationship between abdominal scar characteristics and the occurrence of cervical stenosis in patients one year after undergoing ART. The abdominal scars were evaluated using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). Seventy-two participants were enrolled in the study, including 15 (20.8%) women with cervical stenosis, and 57 (79.2%) without stenosis. Results showed that the mean abdominal scar score assessed by VSS was higher in patients with cervical stenosis (7, range: 1-10) compared to those without stenosis (4, range: 0-9) (P = 0.001). Incidence rates of cervical stenosis increased with the VSS score. For women with VSS scores of 0 to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively, the occurrences of cervical stenosis were 6.1%, 16.7%, 16.7%, 27.3%, 37.5%, 50% and 100%. The cutoff point of VSS score was 7 according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Fourteen of the 15 stenosis happened either in patients without anti-stenosis tools (Foley catheters or tailed intrauterine devices) placed during the surgery or after the devices were removed. Our results demonstrated that VSS is an effective approach to assess the presence of cervical stenosis after ART. Women who have an abdominal scar with a VSS score > 7 have a high risk of developing isthmic stenosis without anti-stenosis tools in place.","output":"Abdominal scar characteristics as a predictor of cervical stenosis after abdominal radical trachelectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To select potential molecules that can target viral spike proteins, which may potentially interrupt the interaction between the human angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and viral spike protein by virtual screening. METHODS: The three-dimensional (3D)-coordinate file of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-ACE2 complex for searching a suitable docking pocket was firstly downloaded and prepared. Secondly, approximately 15,000 molecular candidates were prepared, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs from DrugBank and natural compounds from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), for the docking process. Then, virtual screening was performed and the binding energy in Autodock Vina was calculated. Finally, the top 20 molecules with high binding energy and their Chinese medicine (CM) herb sources were listed in this paper. RESULTS: It was found that digitoxin, a cardiac glycoside in DrugBank and bisindigotin in TCMSP had the highest docking scores. Interestingly, two of the CM herbs containing the natural compounds that had relatively high binding scores, Forsythiae fructus and Isatidis radix, are components of Lianhua Qingwen (), a CM formula reportedly exerting activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Cov-2. Moreover, raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, was found to have a relatively high binding score. CONCLUSIONS: A class of compounds, which are from FDA-approved drugs and CM natural compounds, that had high binding energy with RBD of the viral spike protein. Our work provides potential candidates for other researchers to identify inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and highlights the importance of CM and integrative application of CM and Western medicine on treating COVID-19.","output":"In Silico Screening of Potential Spike Glycoprotein Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 with Drug Repurposing Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanoengineering exploits the interactions of materials at the nanometre scale to create functional nanostructures.

Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","output":"SARS-CoV2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic struck globally and has affected higher education institutions (HEIs) and their operations, indirectly impacting the progress of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 achieved thus far.

The purpose of this study was to compare resource utilization, episode-of-care (EOC) costs, readmissions, and complications of robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty (RATKA) and manual TKA (MTKA). Methods TKA procedures were identified from a private payer claims database. RATKA procedures required both a robotic arm-assisted procedure code and a 60-day pre-operative computed tomography scan. Propensity score matching (1:5 RATKA to MTKA) was performed, based on various patient characteristics and comorbidities. After matching, 4452 patients (742 RATKA and 3710 MTKA) were analyzed for 90-day and one-year EOC costs, index TKA costs, lengths of stay (LOS), discharge statuses, rehabilitation utilizations, as well as 90-day and one-year readmissions- and knee-related complications. Results RATKA patients had shorter LOS (mean 1.56 versus 1.91 days; p < 0.001), lower index costs by $1762 ($32,747 versus $34,509; p = 0.003), and higher discharges to home rates (51.8 versus 47.8%; p = 0.049) than MTKA patients. RATKA patients had less 90-day (68.5 versus 72.0%; p = 0.048) and one-year (70.8 versus 75.0%; p = 0.016) home health utilizations.

No significant differences in readmission and overall complication rates were observed (p > 0.05). Conclusion RATKA was associated with lower index costs and EOC costs at both 90 days and one year. These patients had shorter LOS, were discharged home more frequently, and used less home health services. Cost savings were demonstrated for RATKA beyond the 90-day period with an increase in savings between 90-day and one-year time points.

We applied statistical methods previously developed to adjust for the delay between diagnosis and death and presented both delay-adjusted and crude (unadjusted) CFRs throughout the epidemic. Results The overall estimated delay-adjusted CFR was 2.39% (3.05% for males and 1.92% for females).

In this work, we analyze the global statistics of Omicron-impacted countries including South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy to quantitatively estimate the intensity and severity of recent waves. Next, these statistics are used to estimate the impact of Omicron in India, which is experiencing an intense third wave of COVID-19 since 28 Dec., 2021. The rapid surge in the daily number of infections, comparable to the global trends, strongly suggests the dominance of the Omicron variant in infections in India. The logarithmic regression suggests the early growth rate of infections in this wave is nearly four times that in the second wave. Another notable difference in this wave is the relatively concurrent arrival of outbreaks all across the country; the effective reproduction number (Rt) although has significant variations among different regions. The test positivity rate (TPR) also displays a rapid growth in the last 10 days in several states. Preliminary estimates with the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model suggest that the peak in India to occur in late January 2022 with a caseload exceeding that in the second wave.

Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months.

Partial correlations revealed that an association between social media engagement and loneliness disappeared when social comparison orientation was controlled for;however, an inverse relationship between social media engagement and well-being remained, even when social comparison orientation was accounted for.","output":"Young Indians, Social Media, and COVID-19: Study on the Relation Between Engagements on Social Media and Mental Well-Being During the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This work investigated the endocytic pathways taken by poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate) (PIBCA) nanoparticles differing in their surface composition and architecture, assuming that this might determine their efficiency of intracellular drug delivery. METHODS: Nanoparticles (A0, A25, A100, R0, R25 ) were prepared by anionic or redox radical emulsion polymerization using mixtures of dextran and fucoidan (0, 25, 100 % in fucoidan). Cell uptake was evaluated by incubating J774A.1 macrophages with nanoparticles. Endocytic pathways were studied by incubating cells with endocytic pathway inhibitors (chlorpromazine, genistein, cytochalasin D, methyl-?-cyclodextrin and nocodazole) and nanoparticle uptake was evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The fucoidan-coated PIBCA nanoparticles A(25) were internalized 3-fold more efficiently than R(25) due to the different architecture of the fucoidan chains presented on the surface. Different fucoidan density and architecture led to different internalization pathway preferred by the cells. Large A(100) nanoparticles with surface was covered with fucoidan chains in a loop and train configuration were internalized the most efficiently, 47-fold compared with A(0), and 3-fold compared with R(0) and R(25) through non-endocytic energy-independent pathways and reached the cell cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: Internalization pathways of PIBCA nanoparticles by J774A.1 macrophages could be determined by nanoparticle fucoidan surface composition and architecture. In turn, this influenced the extent of internalization and localization of accumulated nanoparticles within cells. The results are of interest for rationalizing the design of nanoparticles for potential cytoplamic drug delivery by controlling the nature of the nanoparticle surface.

We also compared the willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine before and after its availability to assess changes in perception and attitude towards vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recovered patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the ICU at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were followed up over a 1-year period to assess vaccine acceptability and acceptance rates, and changes in perception towards COVID-19 vaccination before and after vaccine availability. RESULTS: A total of 98 and 93 patients completed the initial and follow up surveys respectively. During the initial survey, 41% of the patients intended to receive vaccination, 46% responded they would not accept a vaccine against COVID-19 even if it were proven to be safe and effective and 13% undecided. During the follow up survey, 44% of the study cohort had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Major reasons provided by respondents for not accepting COVID-19 vaccine were lack of trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine, pharmaceutical companies, government, vaccine technology, fear of side effects and perceived immunity against COVID-19. Respondents were more likely to be vaccinated if recommended by their physicians (OR 6.4, 95% CI 2.8C8.3), employers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9C5.8), and family and friends (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1C4.5). CONCLUSION: We found a suboptimal COVID-19 vaccination rate in a cohort of patients who recovered from severe infection.

Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group-functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.","output":"Exposure to COVID-19 patients increases physician trainee stress and burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed an unprecedented threat and a great challenge to health professionals in Hong Kong.

An accurate understanding of the bodys temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31C60 days PSO. By 61C90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check? to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1C4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5C7 days PSO.

Increasing studies show that viral infection alters host cells glucose metabolism, which is crucial for viral nucleic acid replication. Here, we integrated RNA-sequencing results and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (oxiPPP), and DNA replication in lung tissues and cells. However, the direction of metabolic flux and DNA replication were dominated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell-expressed viral receptor protein. More interesting, although hosts with high expression of ACE2 are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the invading virus cannot perform nucleic acid replication well due to the restriction of glucose metabolism, and eventually resulting prolonged infection-cycle or infection failure. Our findings, after a typical epidemiological investigation and modeling analysis, preliminarily explain the reasons for the emergence of asymptomatic infections or lower copy virus at early stage in host with higher ACE2 levels, which will provide important help for the development of more accurate and effective detection methods for diagnosing COVID-19.

METHODS A basic interpretive qualitative study approach with semi-structured interviews was conducted and analyzed using a directed and conventional content analysis. Seven participants who had left large cytology reference laboratories were purposively sampled to interview about their experience of leaving the cytology reference laboratories. Conventional content analysis was used to inductively generate themes and deductive content analysis was conducted with categories from the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping or TMSC (ie: stress appraisal and coping style). RESULTS Three main themes were discerned from the interviews; concerns about the cytology workplace, reasons for choosing to leave and strategies for coping with stress. Demand for productivity was the most commonly cited concern among cytotechnologists, followed by work-life balance and musculoskeletal strain related to microscopic screening. The top reason given for people choosing to leave the commercial laboratories was the lack of work-life balance and the second was the lack of professional challenges and growth opportunities. Participants with longer job tenure who experienced a promotion described coping with job stress as more optimistic and problem focused. CONCLUSIONS Opportunities exist within large commercial laboratories around improving work environment to reduce workplace burnout and turnover. Our findings revealed that the most common stressors encountered at large commercial laboratories are productivity demands followed by work-related musculoskeletal strains associated with microscopic screening. Additionally, the top reasons given for people leaving large reference laboratories were the lack of work-life balance and the paucity of professional challenges and growth opportunities.

We encountered a COVID-19 patient manifesting Mobitz 1 atrioventricular (AV) block which normalized as he improved, prompting us to investigate PR interval behavior in COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To characterize PR interval behavior in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and correlate with clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional cohort analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases (March 26CApril 25, 2020). We reviewed pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 ECGs to characterize AV conduction by calculating the PR interval to HR (PR:HR) slope. Clinical endpoints were death or need for endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: ECGs from 75 patients (246 pre-COVID-19 ECGs and 246 COVID-19 ECGs) were analyzed for PR:HR slope. Of these, 38 patients (50.7%) showed the expected PR interval shortening with increasing HR (negative PR:HR slopes), whereas 37 patients (49.3%) showed either no change (8 with PR:HR slopes=0) or paradoxical PR interval prolongation (29 with positive PR:HR slopes) with increasing HR. Patients without PR interval shortening were more likely to die (11/37, 29.7% vs. 3/38, 7.9%, P=0.019) or require endotracheal intubation (16/37, 43.2% vs. 8/38, 21.1%, P=0.05) compared to patients with PR interval shortening.

These factors caused waste treatment facilities to be overwhelmed, forcing emergency treatment and disposals (e.g., co-disposal in a municipal solid waste incinerator, cement kilns, industrial furnaces, and deep burial) to ramp up processing capacity. This paper discussed the ways the operation of those facilities must be improved to cope with the challenge of handling medical waste, as well as working around the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. The study also highlights the need for short, mid, and longer-term responses towards waste management during the pandemic. Furthermore, the practices discussed in this paper may provide an option for alternative approaches and development of sustainable strategies for mitigating similar pandemics in the future.","output":"Challenges and practices on waste management and disposal during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine1-3 has demonstrated clinical efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, including against the B.1.351 variant that is partially resistant to neutralizing antibodies1.

Here we report humoral and cellular immune responses from 20 Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals from the COV1001 phase I-IIa clinical trial2 against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020 as well as against the B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, P.1 and B.1.351 variants of concern. Ad26.COV2.S induced median pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres that were 5.0-fold and 3.3-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020 on day 71 after vaccination. Median binding antibody titres were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold lower against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, respectively, as compared with WA1/2020. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement deposition and natural killer cell activation responses were largely preserved against the B.1.351 variant. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, including central and effector memory responses, were comparable among the WA1/2020, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. These data show that neutralizing antibody responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S were reduced against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, but functional non-neutralizing antibody responses and T cell responses were largely preserved against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

This article summarizes the potential benefits of erythropoietin (EPO) in alleviating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis which is now called COVID-19. As with other coronavirus infection, the lethality of COVID-19 is associated with respiratory dysfunction due to overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the host immune responses. The resulting cytokine storm leads to the development of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Erythropoietin, well known for its role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, may have protective effects against ALI/ARDS induced by viral and other pathogens. EPO exerts antiapoptotic and cytoprotective properties under various pathological conditions. With a high safety profile, EPO promotes the production of endothelial progenitor cells and reduce inflammatory processes through inhibition of the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. Thus, it may be considered as a safe drug candidate for COVID-19 patients if given at the early stage of the disease. The potential effects of erythropoietin on different aspects of ALI/ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are reviewed.","output":"A Perspective on Erythropoietin as a Potential Adjuvant Therapy for Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences, and main driving forces of stigma and discrimination among COVID-19 patients, following hospital discharge, in Sri Lanka. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative study was used in order to gain insight and explore the depth and complexity of COVID-19 patients experiences. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted via telephone in a purposively selected sample of 139 COVID-19 patients. Participants were interviewed during the first 3 weeks following discharge from four main state hospitals that were treating COVID-19 patients during the early phase of the pandemic. Questions on stigma and discrimination were open-ended, enabling patients to provide responses about their different experiences and settings; results were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants were men (n = 80; 57.6%), with a mean age of 43 years (SD = 11.2). In total, up to one-third of the study participants experienced stigma related to COVID-19 and were discriminated against by the community, co-workers and healthcare workers in Sri Lanka. Social discrimination included barriers in accessing basic needs, insulting, blaming, defaming, spreading rumours and receiving no support during emergencies. Workplace discrimination included loss of jobs, not allowing re-entry and loss of earnings due to self-employment. Discrimination by healthcare workers included breaching of confidentiality, lack of respect, not providing health services and communication barriers. Discrimination has led to social isolation, not seeking help and severe psychosocial issues impacting their family relationships. Irresponsible media reporting and sensationalism of news coverage leading to breaching of privacy and confidentiality, defaming, false allegations and reporting household details without consent were perceived as the main factors underlying the views and opinions of the general public. CONCLUSIONS: Stigma and discrimination experienced by COVID-19 patients in society, workplaces and healthcare facilities have serious negative consequences at the individual and family level. Regulations on responsible media reporting, including an effective risk communication strategy to counteract its effects, are strongly recommended.","output":"Why are you not dead yet?

METHODS Previously healthy children <2 years old with mild (outpatients) and severe (inpatients) RSV infection were enrolled and viral loads measured by polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were stratified by age in 0-<3, 3-6 and >6-24 months, and multivariable analyses were performed to identify clinical and viral factors associated with severe disease. RESULTS From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 534 children with RSV infection, 130 outpatients with mild RSV infection and 404 inpatients with severe RSV disease. Median duration of illness was 4 days for both groups, yet viral loads were higher in outpatients than in inpatients (P < 0.001). In bivariate analyses, wheezing was more frequent in outpatients of older age (>3 months) than in inpatients (P < 0.01), while fever was more common in inpatients than outpatients (P < 0.01) and its frequency increased with age. Adjusted analyses confirmed that increased work of breathing and fever were consistently associated with hospitalization irrespective of age, while wheezing in infants >3 months, and higher RSV loads in children >6-24 months were independently associated with reduced disease severity. CONCLUSIONS Age had a significant impact defining the interactions among viral loads, specific clinical manifestations and disease severity in children with RSV infection.

DESIGN: Using social media for recruitment, we partnered with a local community task force to administer a brief online survey. SETTING: Residential urban community. SAMPLE: Eighty-four community members, the majority of whom were white, female, college educated completed the survey. MEASURES: Theory of planned behavior constructs: behavioral intentions, attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control for 3 social distancing behaviors: maintaining a 6-foot distance, avoiding places people congregate, and staying home as much as possible. ANALYSIS: Path analyses were conducted to understand significant determinants of intentions for each behavior to guide the development of locally tailored health promotion messages. RESULTS: The RCBD was implemented, and results were communicated to the community within 1 week. Intentions were high across the 3 behaviors but lowest for staying home as much as possible. Younger participants had lower intentions of maintaining a 6-foot distance than older participants. For each behavior, specific recommendations for health promotion messaging emerged based on how attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to intentions.

The failure of numerous past disease-modification trials in PD has been attributed to a variety of factors related not only to choosing wrong interventions, but also to using inadequate trial designs and target populations. In patients with clinically established PD, neuronal pathology may already have advanced too far to be modified by any intervention. Based on such reasoning, individuals in yet prediagnostic or prodromal disease stages, may provide a window of opportunity to test disease-modifying strategies. There is now sufficient evidence from prospective studies to define diagnostic criteria for prodromal PD and several approaches have been studied in observational cohorts. These include the use of PD-risk algorithms derived from multiple established risk factors for disease as well as follow-up of cohorts with single defined prodromal markers like hyposmia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders, or PD gene carriers. In this review, we discuss recruitment strategies for disease-modification trials in various prodromal PD cohorts, as well as potential trial designs, required trial durations, and estimated sample sizes.

This study aimed to better understand patient perception regarding telemedicine visits in a pediatric subspecialty clinic and to describe differences in management provided virtually versus in-person. Materials and Methods: This survey study and chart review was conducted at the Doernbecher Childrens Hospital gastroenterology outreach clinics from May to June, 2020. The main hospital is located in Portland, Oregon, with the outreach clinics located in Salem, Eugene, and Medford, Oregon. Families were surveyed within 2 weeks of their visit, with a 6-month follow up survey. Results: There were 111 respondents to the initial survey (34% response rate). The majority of patients had initial positive impressions of telemedicine, with 75% feeling that the quality of telemedicine visits were as good as or better than in-person visits. At 6 months, there were 80 respondents (34% response rate), and this positive impression persisted with 72% of families reporting no negatives from their telemedicine experience. New patients seen via telemedicine were prescribed medications more frequently than those seen in-person (73% versus 45%, p = 0.02). Discussion: Patients and families felt the benefits of telemedicine visits outweighed the limitations both initially and at 6-month follow up. Telemedicine offers an effective alternative for pediatric subspecialty care especially for select conditions and follow up visits. However, the more frequent prescriptions could reflect the adaptation of clinical practice with the telemedicine platform, and further studies are needed.","output":"Patient Satisfaction and Perceived Quality of Care with Telemedicine in a Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 mitigation measures have major ramifications on all aspects of peoples livelihoods. Based on data collected in February 2021, we present an analysis of the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures in three counties in Kenya. Methods: : We conducted a cross-sectional phone-based survey in three counties in Kenya to assess the level of disruption across seven domains: income, food insecurity, schooling, domestic tension/violence, communal violence, mental health, and decision-making. An overall disruption index was computed from the seven domains using principal component analysis. We used a linear regression model to examine the determinants of vulnerability to disruptions as measured by the index. We used concentration curves and indices to assess inequality in the disruption domains and the overall disruption index. Results: : The level of disruption in income was the highest (74%), while the level of disruption for domestic tension/violence was the lowest (30%). Factors associated with increased vulnerability to the overall disruption index included: older age, being married, belonging in the lowest socio-economic tertile and receiving COVID-19 related assistance. The concentration curves showed that all the seven domains of disruption were disproportionately concentrated among households in the lowest socio-economic tertile, a finding that was supported by the concentration index of the overall disruption index (CI = - 0.022;p = 0.074). Conclusion: The COVID-19 mitigation measures resulted in unintended socio-economic effects that unfairly affected certain vulnerable groups, including those in the lowest socio-economic group and the elderly. Measures to protect households against the adverse socio-economic effects of the pandemic should be scaled up and targeted to the most vulnerable, with attention to the constantly evolving nature of the pandemic.","output":"Assessing equity and the determinants of socio-economic impacts of COVID-19: results from a cross-sectional survey in three counties in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The closure of day-care centres as a measure to contain the corona virus presented early childhood educators with changed working conditions and opportunities to implement the continuing educational mandate.

Objective: To determine the frequency rate (note that is it implicit that frequency is a rate like incidence so including rate seems redundant here. This is bounded by zero and infinity. In contrast, prevalence is bounded by 0 and 1 and is thus a proportion not a rate) of lower back pain and its associated risks amongst health professionals in the Arua District of Uganda. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study of 245 consecutive participants conducted during February-April 2020. We stratified risks as individual or work related and analyzed the data using IBM SPSS version 25. Chi-square was used to measure the significance of association between categorical variables at 95% confidence interval, regarding a p  0.05 as significant. Results: The mean age of participants was 40.87 years  8.74 (SD), with female predominance (69.8%). Majority were either general nurses or midwives (64.9%) and more than half had practiced for over 6C10 years. The frequency rate of lower back pain was 39.6% (n = 97). Individual factors associated with LBP were; cigarette smoking (X(2) = 33.040; P  0.001), alcohol consumption (X(2) = 13.581; P  0.001), age (X(2) = 14.717; P = 0.002), and female gender (X(2) = 4.802; P = 0.028). The work related factors significantly associated with lower back pain were: being a nurse/midwife (X(2) = 9.829; P = 0.007), working in the outpatient department (X(2) = 49.752; P  0.001), bending (X(2) = 43.912; P  0.001), lifting (X(2) = 33.279; P < 0.001), over standing (X(2) = 40.096; P  0.001), being in awkward positions (X(2) = 15.607; P= < 0.001), and pushing patients (X(2) = 21.999; P  0.001).

Objectives: To examine the adaptability of clinician-researchers in rheumatology in a time of crisis focusing on academic output in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the professional and private burden experienced by health care workers in rheumatology. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv for reports of rheumatic diseases and COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 submitted (or published) from January 1 to June 30 2020 was carried out. As comparison, publications from April 6 to 13 2019 of the same rheumatic diseases without COVID-19 were analysed in terms of author characteristics and journal metrics. Additionally, a questionnaire was circulated via EULAR countries rheumatology societies and individual working group members. The participants were asked to answer 43 questions regarding their family situation, professional background, research output, changes in work and private responsibilities during the pandemic as well as the burden experienced. Responses were collected using an online survey tool and data analyses performed with SPSS Statistics 25;missing variable analysis was performed, excluding records with >15% missing responses. Descriptive and summary statistics were calculated for the entire dataset and split by gender. Results: Whereas the overall number of publications and authors was equal between 2020 and 2019, the portion of female first authors of review articles and original studies decreased substantially in the first phase of the pandemic (Table 1). The numerical contribution of female authors in highly ranked journals (impact factor>6) was comparable in 2019 and 2020, however, the percentage of female first authors dropped from 50% to 32% (P=0.07). In the survey, a total dataset was available for N=180 responders. On average, female respondents (52.5%) were younger, more likely to live alone (19,1% vs 10,5%) and have no caring responsibilities (51.1% vs. 36.3%) than male respondents. Male doctors were more often tenure-track/tenured or chairmen (31.4% vs 12.8% female) and worked less often part-time (9,3% vs. 19.1%). Unpaid overtime hours of all participants were striking with 46.3/44,2% (female/male) reporting to accumulate >10 hours/ week. Regarding gender differences in scientific output, male respondents more frequently revealed >20 publications as first (57,6% vs. 26,9%) or last authors (34.1% vs. 10,1%). Similarly, 44,7% of male respondents reported a last author publication during COVID-19 vs. 26,4% of female respondents. While female and male respondents reported similar experience of burden during the pandemic, more female respondents reported increased family care as a major source of this (38,2% vs. 22,2%). Both genders would like to see increased support from superiors and official institutions. Conclusion: In a time of acute crisis, the adaptability of scientifically active female health care workers in rheumatology is lower than that of their male counterparts. This is reflected in a lower scientific output, especially as first or last authors. However, the burden experienced in the current pandemic is similar between the genders.

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic (namely, 4 in this paper) and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level (i.e., the target transmission rate) for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million of infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billions ? instead of 6.88 millions of infected and a loss of 241 billions ?. This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier.

On a 1C10 scale self-assessing baseline confidence in neurosurgical concepts, participants were most confident in neuroendocrinology (6.79  0.31) and least confident in spine oncology (4.24  0.44), with an average of 5.05  0.32 across all topics. Quality ratings for all seminars were favorable. The mean postcourse confidence was 7.79  0.19, representing an improvement of 3.13  0.38 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Feedback on seminar quality and improvements in confidence in neurosurgical topics suggest that an interactive virtual course may be an effective means of improving students' foundational neurosurgical knowledge and providing networking opportunities before application cycles. Comparison with in-person rotations when these are reestablished may help define roles for these tools.","output":"Student Survey Results of a Virtual Medical Student Course Developed as a Platform for Neurosurgical Education During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the design of an online social skills development interface for teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who often lack access to social skills training.

Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using the hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers, and through thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.","output":"A Virtual Conversational Agent for Teens with Autism: Experimental Results and Design Lessons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","output":"Author Correction: Pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2: the knowns and unknowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While U.S. adults living in affordable senior housing represent a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic, affordable housing may provide a foundation for interventions designed to improve technology access to support health.

METHODS: Multicentre-combined (retrospective-prospective) cohort study with AC patients in the Community of Madrid between 1st March and 30th May 2020. 257 AC patients were involved in 16 public hospital. Multivariant binomial logistic regression (MBLR) was applied to mortality. RESULTS: Of COVID-19 patients, 30 were diagnosed at admission and 12 patients were diagnosed during de admission or 30 days after discharge. In non-COVID-19 patients, antibiotic therapy was received in 61.3% of grade I AC and 40.6% of grade II AC. 52.4% of grade III AC were treated with percutaneous drainage (PD). Median hospital stay was 5 [3-8] days, which was higher in the non-surgical treatment group with 7.51 days (p < 0.001) and a 3.25% of mortality rate (p < 0.21). 93.3% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.03), median hospital stay was 11.0 [7.5-27.5] days (p < 0.001) with a 7.5% of mortality rate (p > 0.05). In patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91.7% of grade I-II AC were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.037), with a median hospital stay of 16 [4-21] days and a 18.2% mortality rate (p > 0.05). Hospital-acquired infection risk when hospital stay is > 7 days is OR 4.7, CI 95% (1.3-16.6), p = 0.009. COVID-19 mortality rate was 11.9%, AC severity adjusted OR 5.64 (CI 95% 1.417-22.64). In MBLR analysis, age (OR 1.15, CI 95% 1.02-1.31), SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 14.49, CI 95% 1.33-157.81), conservative treatment failure (OR 8.2, CI 95% 1.34-50.49) and AC severity were associated with an increased odd of mortality. CONCLUSION: In our population, during COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase of non-surgical treatment which was accompanied by an increase of conservative treatment failure, morbidity and hospital stay length which may have led to an increased risk hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this research, the concept of FH has been used for a more effective and faster connection of consumers to production sites. Due to prevention of the spread of coronavirus and the quarantine conditions, the areas have been divided into two parts (high-risk and low-risk) and two scenarios have been defined for this supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to reduce costs and environmental impacts as much as possible. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software for small- and middle-size test problems, and it is solved with genetic optimization algorithm as a meta-heuristic approach for large-size problems. Also, to solve the developed linear multi-objective model, augmented ?-constraint approach is applied, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. Numerical and computational results are provided to prove the efficiency and feasibility of the presented model.

RESULTS The global cases of COVID-19 as of April 2, 2020, have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness. Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from an underlying chronic medical condition like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory illness or cardiovascular diseases.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series analysis of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the hospital because of pneumonia. We recorded history, clinical parameters and medications. LUS was performed and scored in a standardized fashion by experienced operators, with evaluation of up to 12 lung fields, reporting especially on B-lines and consolidations. RESULTS: We included 96 patients, 58.3% men, with a mean age of 65.9 years. Patients with a high-risk quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) were older and had worse outcomes, especially for the need for high-flow oxygen. B-lines and consolidations were located mainly in the lower posterior lung fields. LUS patterns for B-lines and consolidations were significantly worse in all lung fields among patients with high versus low qCSI. B-lines and consolidations were worse in the intermediate disease stage, from day 7 to 13 after onset of symptoms. While consolidations correlated more with inflammatory biomarkers, B-lines correlated more with end-organ damage, including extrapulmonary involvement. CONCLUSIONS: LUS patterns provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that correlated with severity and dynamically reflect disease stage. LUS patterns may reflect different pathophysiological processes related to inflammation or tissue damage; consolidations may represent a more specific sign of localized disease, whereas B-lines seem to be also dependent upon generalized illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Lung Ultrasound Patterns and Clinical-Laboratory Correlates during COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study from North East Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It appears inevitable that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will continue to spread.

The well-known sine trigonometric function maintains the periodicity and symmetry of the origin in nature and thus satisfies the expectations of the experts over the multi parameters. Taking this feature and the significance of the SFSs into the consideration, the main objective of the article is to describe some reliable sine trigonometric laws for SFSs. Associated with these laws, we develop new average and geometric aggregation operators to aggregate the Spherical fuzzy numbers. Then, we presented a group decision-making strategy to address the multi-attribute group decision-making problem using the developed aggregation operators. To verify the value of the defined operators, a MAGDM strategy is provided along with an application for the selection of an authentic COVID-19 laboratory.

It is known that periods of stress and psychological distress can affect womens menstrual cycles. We, therefore, performed an observational study of womens reproductive health over the course of the pandemic. Materials & Methods: An anonymous digital survey was shared by the authors via social media in September 2020. All women of reproductive age were invited to complete the survey. Results: 1031 women completed the survey. The mean age was 36.7  6.6 years. 693/70% reported recording their cycles using an app or diary. 233/23% were using hormonal contraception. 441/46% reported a change in their menstrual cycle since the beginning of the pandemic. 483/53% reported worsening premenstrual symptoms, 100/18% reported new menorrhagia (p=0.003) and 173/30% new dysmenorrhea (p<0.0001) compared to before the pandemic. 72/9% reported missed periods who not previously missed periods (p=0.003) and the median number of missed periods was 2 (IQR 1-3). 17/21% of those who occasionally missed periods pre-pandemic missed periods often during the pandemic. 467/45% reported a reduced libido. There was no change in the median cycle length (28 days) or days of bleeding (5) but there was a wider variability of cycle length (p=0.01) and a 1-day median decrease in the minimum (p<0.0001) and maximum (p=0.009) cycle length.

Management of BE with low-grade dysplasia continues to be controversial. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or EAC among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) compared with surveillance endoscopy. METHODS Our search included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central, was limited to English language articles, and was last searched on 31 December 2015. Studies were reviewed by title and abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. Two independent reviewers extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. The primary outcome of interest was the relative risk of disease progression among patients with BE with low-grade dysplasia treated with RFAcompared with surveillance. RESULTS Our search resulted in 2,029 citations, 19 studies were included in the final analysis, totaling 2,746 patients. Relative risk of disease progression in RFA compared with surveillance was 0.14% (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.45), P=0.001. This measure was stable when only all studies were included. Absolute risk reduction was 10.9% and the number needed to treat was 9.2. Results were stable over several quality measures, overtime, and when excluding randomized trials. The cumulative rate of progression to high-grade dysplasia/EAC was lower in RFA compared with surveillance (1.7% vs. 12.6%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Similarly, the incidence rate of progression among patients with surveillance was significantly higher from those treated with RFA (0.022 vs. 0.005, P<0.001).

Analysing the data from January 2015 to March 2021, we found that the total, residential and non-residential monthly consumptions dropped significantly after Thailands State of Emergency was declared in March 2020. Unlike other studies that reported residential consumption increasing when people were required to stay home for a prolonged period, Phukets residential consumption decreased by more than 10% from the pre-COVID-19 level, possibly due to the drop in peer-to-peer accommodation bookings. To study the impact on consumption in detail, we modelled using cascade regression analysis by dividing the predictors into three groups, namely socioeconomics, weather and calendar period. The results showed that the number of guest arrivals was the most statistically significant in all types of consumption and should be used as a predictor for water demand forecasting models in tourism areas.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on monthly water consumption on a tropical tourism island: case study of Phuket (Thailand)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China. As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method: By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R 0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R 0t ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R 0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R 0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R 0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R 0t . Conclusion: The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R 0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of the Transmissibility Change of 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia and Its Potential Factors in China from 2019 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: In March 2020, many state, local, and national governments declared various states of emergencies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Massachusetts, where our multidisciplinary pediatric feeding clinic is located, the governor declared of a state of emergency encouraging social distancing, and simultaneously signed an order establishing reimbursement parity for telehealth visits to in-office traditional visits by both commercial and state health insurers. This presented a challenge and an opportunity for our multidisciplinary program for children with pediatric feeding disorders embedded in a large academic childrens hospital. In this paper we aim to provide a roadmap for rapid implementation of telehealth practice without a reliance on in-person care in a multidisciplinary pediatric feeding clinic. Description: Within a week, the program pivoted from solely in-person care to 100% telehealth services for both new and established patients. Through this transition, the program encountered several challenges with technology, scheduling, licensing, and concerns for reinforcing pre-existing healthcare disparities. Assessment: The program quickly overcame many of these challenges and found telehealth to offer benefits to patients such as improved coordination of care with other agencies, reduced appointment times, and reduced travel time and travel cost. Even with a reduction in the number of patients seen per clinic due to the manner in which telehealth was implemented, there was an increase in the number of visits completed with a slight reduction in the no-show rate. Additionally, providers in the program are better able to evaluate feeding practices in the home and understand many of the barriers families may face in implementing interventions. While telehealth does have some challenges, it can help to improve access, communication, and may increase patient satisfaction for children who require multidisciplinary care for their pediatric feeding disorder. Conclusion: Our hope is that billing parity for telehealth will continue to be supported by insurance companies and state governments throughout the remainder of this pandemic, and far beyond.","output":"Conversion of a Traditional In-Person Feeding Clinic to a Telehealth-Only Model of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses have a unique place in redesigning the future of healthcare, particularly after experiencing health policy failures with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

We use codon-based substitution models to infer the length of branches in viral phylogenies; these models produce estimates that are often considerably longer than those obtained with traditional nucleotide-based substitution models. Correcting the apparent underestimation of branch lengths suggests substantially older origins for measles, Ebola, and avian influenza viruses.

METHODS Data were collected on 2,857 blood donors from April 14 to 27, 2020. This study reports crude prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, population weighted prevalence for the state, and prevalence adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. Logistic regression models were used to establish the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. For the analysis, we considered collection period and site, sociodemographic characteristics, and place of residence. RESULTS The proportion of positive tests for SARS-Cov-2, without any adjustment, was 4.0% (95%CI 3.3-4.7%), and the weighted prevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.1-4.5%). We found lower estimates after adjusting for test sensitivity and specificity: 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.4%) for the non-weighted prevalence, and 3.3% (95%CI 2.6-4.1%) for the weighted prevalence. Collection period was the variable most significantly associated with crude prevalence: the later the period, the higher the prevalence. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, the younger the blood donor, the higher the prevalence, and the lower the education level, the higher the odds of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 antibody. We found similar results for weighted prevalence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings comply with some basic premises: the increasing trend over time, as the epidemic curve in the state is still on the rise; and the higher prevalence among both the youngest, for moving around more than older age groups, and the less educated, for encountering more difficulties in following social distancing recommendations.

Chronic suppurative OM (CSOM) presents as a more severe form of OM, involving perforation of the tympanic membrane. The pathogenesis of OM in these varied clinical presentations is unclear but activation of the innate inflammatory responses to viral and/or bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract performs an integral role. This localised inflammatory response can persist even after pathogens are cleared from the middle ear, eustachian tubes and, in the case of respiratory viruses, even the nasal compartment. Children prone to OM may experience an over exuberant inflammatory response that underlies the development of chronic forms of OM and their sequelae, including hearing impairment. Treatments for chronic effusive forms of OM are limited, with current therapeutic guidelines recommending a watch and wait strategy rather than active treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs. Overall, there is a clear need for more targeted and effective treatments that either prevent or reduce the hyper-inflammatory response associated with chronic forms of OM. Improved treatment options rely upon an in-depth understanding of OM pathogenesis, particularly the role of the host innate immune response during acute OM. In this paper, we review the current literature regarding the innate immune response within the middle ear to bacterial and viral otopathogens alone, and as co-infections. This is an important consideration, as the role of respiratory viruses as primary pathogens in OM is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, increased reporting from PCR-based diagnostics, indicates that viral/bacterial co-infections in the middle ear are more common than bacterial infections alone. Increasingly, the mechanisms by which viral/bacterial co-infections may drive or maintain complex innate immune responses and inflammation during OM as a chronic response require investigation. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic OM, including host innate immune response within the middle ear is vital for development of improved diagnostic and treatment options for our children.","output":"Innate Immunity in the Middle Ear Mucosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are leukocytes specialised in the uptake, processing, and presentation of antigen and fundamental in regulating both innate and adaptive immune functions. They are mainly localised at the interface between body surfaces and the environment, continuously scrutinising incoming antigen for the potential threat it may represent to the organism. In the respiratory tract, DCs constitute a tightly enmeshed network, with the most prominent populations localised in the epithelium of the conducting airways and lung parenchyma. Their unique localisation enables them to continuously assess inhaled antigen, either inducing tolerance to inoffensive substances, or initiating immunity against a potentially harmful pathogen. This immunological homeostasis requires stringent control mechanisms to protect the vital and fragile gaseous exchange barrier from unrestrained and damaging inflammation, or an exaggerated immune response to an innocuous allergen, such as in allergic asthma. During DC activation, there is upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers, enabling DC to activate na?ve T cells. This activation is accompanied by chemokine and cytokine release that not only serves to amplify innate immune response, but also determines the type of effector T cell population generated. An increasing body of recent literature provides evidence that different DC subpopulations, such as myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) in the lungs occupy a key position at the crossroads between tolerance and immunity.

The study investigated the acceptability of the tour to the public and evaluated its impact on public attitudes about mental health. METHODS: Participants were Gallery visitors over four consecutive days. The tour led visitors on 10 stops through the Gallery. Each stop focused on artworks and Gallery spaces, challenged common myths about mental health, and invited visitors to consider their personal views. Participants completed measures of mood and attitudes about mental health pre- and post-tour and provided narrative feedback. RESULTS: Pre-tour, participants (N = 213) reported high levels of happiness, compassion towards people with mental health conditions, comfort talking about mental health, and positive attitudes about mental health. Post-tour, participants (N = 111) reported significant increases in happiness, comfort, and positive attitudes.

Most studies focus on HH compliance within the hospital setting, whereas little is known for the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate compliance with HH recommendations in general practitioners (GPs) office, based on World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. METHODS: An observational study was conducted at five Dutch GPs-practices in September 2017. We measured HH compliance through direct observation using WHOs five moments of hand hygiene observation tool. All observations were done by one trained professional. RESULTS: We monitored a total of 285 HH opportunities for 30 health care workers (HCWs). The overall compliance was 37%. Hand hygiene compliance was 34, 51 and 16% for general practitioners, practice assistants, and nurses, respectively. It varies between 63% after body fluid exposure and no HH performance before-, during and after home visit of a patient (defined as moment 5). The preferred method of HH was soap and water (63%) versus 37% for alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR). The median time of disinfecting hands was 8 s (range 6C11 s) for HCWs in our study. CONCLUSIONS: HH compliance among HCWs in Dutch GPs was found to be low, especially with regard to home visits.

Methods: We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with COVID-19 (0-15 yrs.-old) between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020. We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of children's lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells, RNA-sequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infections. Results: It revealed that infants (< 1yrs.-old), with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children (> 1 yrs.-old) are more resistant to lung injury. The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in children's lung. ACE2 is notably expressed not only in Alveolar Type II (AT II) cells, but also in SOX9 positive lung progenitor cells detected in both pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants' lungs. The ACE2(+)SOX9(+) cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children. Conclusions: Infants (< 1 yrs.-old) with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more vulnerable to lung injuries. ACE2 expression in multiple types of lung cells including SOX9 positive progenitor cells, in cooperation with an unestablished immune system, could be risk factors contributing to vulnerability of infants with COVID-19.

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status. We also describe a simple method to measure intracellular cytokine production to evaluate the inflammatory activity of neutrophils and IMMs in a mouse model of human coronavirus infection.","output":"Evaluation of Activation and Inflammatory Activity of Myeloid Cells During Pathogenic Human Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The safety of therapeutic hypothermia combined with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has been challenged after reports of high risk of stent thrombosis. METHODS We searched the Western Denmark Heart Registry to identify patients with an acute coronary angiography due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest performed at our institution between September 2010 and September 2013. We identified 68 unconscious patients, who were resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and underwent acute PCI with stent implantation and immediate therapeutic hypothermia, and followed these for 30 days. Target temperature of 32-34C was achieved by either an invasive or a non-invasive cooling system. RESULTS All patients had elevated myocardial biomarkers and 37 patients had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Bare metal stents were implanted in 14 and drug-eluting stents in 54 patients. All patients received antithrombotic treatment with a standard loading dose of 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and 10,000 units heparin intravenously prior PCI. Clopidogrel or ticagrelor was administered orally through a gastric tube immediately after PCI. During the procedure abciximab or bivalirudin was administered in 44 patients. Electrocardiographic and clinical signs of stent thrombosis were found in one patient. CONCLUSIONS We observed one stent thrombosis in this cohort of 68 consecutive patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were treated with PCI and therapeutic hypothermia.

Furthermore, blood exposure to shear stress via both Centrimag and Impella 5.5 resulted in a minor decrease of platelet count with associated ejection of procoagulant MPs, and a decrease of vWF functional activity (but not plasma level of vWF-antigen). Greater MP generation was observed with the Centrimag relative to the Impella 5.5.

The whole genome sequences of these isolates are 28,035 nucleotides in length and have characteristics similar to those of other PEDV isolates.

METHODS The TIAregistry.org enrolled 4789 patients (1149 Asians and 3640 non-Asians) with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke within 7 days of onset. Every participating facility had systems dedicated to urgent intervention of TIA/stroke patients by specialists. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, and nonfatal acute coronary syndrome. RESULTS Approximately 80% of patients were evaluated within 24 hours of symptom onset. At 1 year, there were no differences in the rates of composite cardiovascular events (6.8% versus 6.0%; P=0.38) and stroke (6.0% versus 4.8%; P=0.11) between Asians and non-Asians. Asians had a lower risk of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA) than non-Asians (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.98; P=0.03); the difference was primarily driven by a lower rate of TIA in Asians (4.2% versus 8.3%; P<0.001). Moderately severe bleeding was more frequent in Asians (0.8% versus 0.3%; P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, multiple acute infarcts (P=0.005) and alcohol consumption (P=0.02) were independent predictors of stroke recurrence in Asians, whereas intracranial stenosis (P<0.001), ABCD2 score (P<0.001), atrial fibrillation (P=0.008), extracranial stenosis (P=0.03), and previous stroke or TIA (P=0.03) were independent predictors in non-Asians. CONCLUSIONS The short-term stroke risk after a TIA or minor stroke was lower than expected when urgent evidence-based care was delivered, irrespective of race/ethnicity or region.

Individuals suffering from these diseases are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections caused by bacterial and/or viral pathogens, which frequently result in exacerbation of symptoms, lung function decline, frequent hospital emergency visits and increased socioeconomic burden. Human rhinoviruses (HRV) remain the major viral pathogen group implicated in exacerbations of both asthma and COPD. The rhinoviral entry into the host lung epithelium is facilitated primarily by the adhesion site (receptor) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), coincidentally expressed on the respiratory epithelium in these conditions. Multiple observations of increased airway ICAM-1 protein in asthmatics, smokers and smoking-related COPD have been recorded in the literature. However, the lack of robust therapies for COPD in particular has triggered a renewed interest in assessing receptor antagonism-based anti-viral strategies for treatment of intercurrent viral infections in those with pre-existing chronic lung diseases. Given the crucial role ICAM-1 plays in facilitating HRV adhesion and, thus, transmissibility to the host respiratory system, as well as the up-regulation of ICAM-1 by smoking, we summarize the role of HRV in smoking-induced COPD and especially highlight the role of ICAM-1 in epithelial viral adhesion and chronic lung disease progression.

With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18C86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1C6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3C4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patients history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Approximately 6.5 to 6.9 million individuals in the United States have heart failure, and the disease costs approximately $43.6 billion in 2020. This research provides geographical incidence and cost models of this disease in the U.S. and explanatory models to account for hospitals number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, geographical, and time-related variables. Methods: The number of diagnoses is forecast using regression (constrained and unconstrained) and ensemble (random forests, extra trees regressor, gradient boosting, and bagging) techniques at the hospital unit of analysis. Descriptive maps of heart failure diagnostic-related groups (DRGs) depict areas of high incidence. State- and county-level spatial and non-spatial regression models of heart failure admission rates are performed. Expenditure forecasts are estimated. Results: The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with the highest intensities in the East and center of the country; however, several Northern states have seen large increases since 2016. The best predictive model for the number of diagnoses (hospital unit of analysis) was an extremely randomized tree ensemble (predictive R(2) = 0.86). The important variables in this model included workload metrics and hospital type. State-level spatial lag models using first-order Queen criteria were best at estimating heart failure admission rates (R(2) = 0.816). At the county level, OLS was preferred over any GIS model based on Morans I and resultant R(2); however, none of the traditional models performed well (R(2) = 0.169 for the OLS). Gradient-boosted tree models predicted 36% of the total sum of squares; the most important factors were facility workload, mean cash on hand of the hospitals in the county, and mean equity of those hospitals. Online interactive maps at the state and county levels are provided. Conclusions. Heart failure and associated expenditures are increasing. Costs of DRGs in the study increased $61 billion from 2016 through 2018. The increase in the more expensive DRG 291 outpaced others with an associated increase of $92 billion. With the increase in demand and steady-state supply of cardiologists, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade.

This study aimed to compare predictors of vaccination intention between healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (non-HCWs) in China. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs and non-HCWs. Several bivariate analysis techniques, eg, crosstab with Chi-square, independent t-test and single factor ANOVA, were performed to analyze the correlation. After that, a series of multivariate binary regressions were employed to determine predictors of vaccination intention. RESULTS: Intention was closely and significantly related with gender, perceived vaccination knowledge, perceived importance and effectiveness of vaccine to prevent COVID-19. HCWs and non-HCWs were heterogeneous, since vaccination intention, perceived knowledge, and attitudes (eg, importance, severity, risk) toward COVID-19 or vaccine had statistically significant difference between the two groups. With comparison of predictors of vaccination intention, for HCWs, demographic factors were the major predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. Female HCWs and HCWs with a Masters or higher degree were more hesitant about vaccination (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), while HCWs had greater vaccination intention as their age increased (P = 0.02). For non-HCWs, perceived vaccination knowledge was the major predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention (P < 0.001). Additionally, perceived importance and effectiveness of vaccine were predictors for both HCWs and non-HCWs. CONCLUSION: Vaccination intention of HCWs was greater than that of non-HCWs in China. Measures should be taken to improve the vaccination rate based on the predictors of vaccination intention identified in this study. For HCWs, especially those with a high level of education or who were females, the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in use may reinforce their vaccination intention. For non-HCWs, popularization of general medical knowledge, including of vaccine-preventable diseases, may increase their vaccination intention.","output":"Comparison of Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccination Intention Between Healthcare Workers and Non-Healthcare Workers in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To characterize the response of patients with acetabular metastases following combined cryoablation and cementoplasty (CCC) for pain palliation and fracture risk reduction, based on completeness of ablation and the presence of pre-existing pathologic fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-nine consecutive acetabular CCC procedures were performed in 37 patients (24 M:13F, age 66  8 years). Pain was assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Development of new or progression of pre-existing fractures and local tumor progression (LTP) were determined on follow-up imaging. Pain score reduction and fracture development rates were compared by ablation completeness and the presence of pre-existing fractures. RESULTS Twenty-three of 27 (85%) patients with evaluable pain scores had reduced pain, decreasing from 7.5  2.1 to 3.6  2.6 (p < 0.0001). Of 39 tumors, 28 (72%) were completely ablated with no significant difference in pain reduction after complete versus incomplete ablations (p = 0.9387). Six of 30 (20%) patients with follow-up imaging demonstrated new/progressive acetabular fractures. Four of 5 (80%) patients with LTP developed new/progressive fractures compared to 2 of 25 (8%) without tumor progression (p = 0.0003). Pre-existing fracture was not associated with subsequent fracture/fracture progression (p = 0.2986). However, patients with prior acetabular radiation therapy or surgery had increased fractures following treatment (p = 0.0380). CONCLUSION Complete acetabular tumor ablation during CCC was not associated with superior pain relief compared to subtotal ablation but did result in improved fracture stabilization. Pre-treatment pathologic fractures were not associated with fracture progression, but new/progressive fractures were more frequent in patients with prior radiation therapy or surgery.","output":"Palliative Percutaneous Cryoablation and Cementoplasty of Acetabular Metastases: Factors Affecting Pain Control and Fracture Risk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics such as COVID-19 place everyone at risk, but certain kinds of risk are differentially severe for groups already made vulnerable by pre-existing forms of social injustice and discrimination.

The hypothesis is that milder symptoms indicating altered thrombocyte function may affect a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals than the recently reported severe cases with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Using an ongoing large, population-based cohort study, more than 80 000 cohort participants were asked through electronic questionnaires about COVID-19 vaccination and potential side effects during weeks 11C13, 2021. The response rate was 58% (81267/138924). Among the vaccinated, 83% were female, 85% health care workers and 80% were aged 40C55 years. The prevalence of self-reported episodes of skin, nose and gingival bleedings were compared after mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccination. Estimates were adjusted for age, sex, occupation, previous COVID-19 infection and chronic disease. RESULTS: Four of the 3416 subjects (0.2%) who were vaccinated with a single dose of mRNA vaccine reported skin bleeding as a side effect, as opposed to 163 of 5132 subjects (3.2%) vaccinated with a single dose of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine, OR (odds ratio) = 16.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5C34.1). Corresponding ORs for nose and gingival bleeding were 8.0 (4.0C15.8) and 9.3 (4.3C20.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could potentially indicate that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine may lead to mild bleeding episodes in a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals, and not only in rare cases with documented thrombosis and thrombocytopenia.

This depression can be reduced through physical activities and use of social media for communication. Therefore, this study aims to examine activities effective in reducing depression by analyzing the differences in physical activities and levels of social media addiction, depending on the level of depression. Methods: A total of 591 Korean males affected by the COVID-19 pandemic participated in the study. Results were extracted by frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, chi-square test, and t-test using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results: Chi-square test, which analyzed differences in demographic characteristics based on the level of depression, revealed significant differences in monthly average family incomes, levels of participation in physical leisure activities, extent of social media usage and kinds of social media used. Significant differences existed in high-intensity physical activities as well as social media non-addiction and addiction depending on the level of depression. Conclusions: Since COVID-19 is increasing depression in males, government or health-related institutes need to provide spacious areas to engage in physical activities, which may help reduce suicidal ideation and restore mental health in Korean males. Moreover, there is a need to develop diverse health-related social media contents, which can help reduce depression.

However, the effects of L-arginine have never been evaluated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted on patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19. Patients received 1.66 g L-arginine twice a day or placebo, administered orally. The primary efficacy endpoint was a reduction in respiratory support assessed 10 and 20 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the length of in-hospital stay, the time to normalization of lymphocyte number, and the time to obtain a negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab. This clinical trial had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04637906. FINDINGS: We present here the results of the initial interim analysis on the first 101 patients. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events were attributable to L-arginine. At 10-day evaluation, 71.1% of patients in the L-arginine arm and 44.4% in the placebo arm (p < 0.01) had the respiratory support reduced; however, a significant difference was not detected 20 days after randomization. Strikingly, patients treated with L-arginine exhibited a significantly reduced in-hospital stay vs placebo, with a median (interquartile range 25(th),75(th) percentile) of 46 days (45,46) in the placebo group vs 25 days (21,26) in the L-arginine group (p < 0.0001); these findings were also confirmed after adjusting for potential confounders including age, duration of symptoms, comorbidities, D-dimer, as well as antiviral and anticoagulant treatments. The other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups.

Objective: To conduct an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mortality and severe adverse events (AEs) associated with receipt vs nonreceipt of ACEIs or ARBs among patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched from December 31, 2019, until September 1, 2020. Study Selection: The meta-analysis included any study design, with the exception of narrative reviews or opinion-based articles, in which COVID-19 was diagnosed through laboratory or radiological test results and in which clinical outcomes (unadjusted or adjusted) associated with COVID-19 were assessed among adult patients (&#8805;18 years) receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Three authors independently extracted data on mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Severe AEs were defined as intensive care unit admission or the need for assisted ventilation. For each outcome, a random-effects model was used to compare the odds ratio (OR) between patients receiving ACEIs or ARBs vs those not receiving ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for mortality and severe AEs associated with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1788 records from the PubMed and Embase databases were identified; after removal of duplicates, 1664 records were screened, and 71 articles underwent full-text evaluation. Clinical data were pooled from 52 eligible studies (40 cohort studies, 6 case series, 4 case-control studies, 1 randomized clinical trial, and 1 cross-sectional study) enrolling 101a?949 total patients, of whom 26 545 (26.0%) were receiving ACEIs or ARBs. When adjusted for covariates, significant reductions in the risk of death (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76; P < .001) and severe AEs (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.88; P < .001) were found. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses of a subgroup of patients with hypertension indicated decreases in the risk of death (unadjusted OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.49-0.91]; P = .01; aOR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.84]; P = .008) and severe AEs (unadjusted OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; P = .007; aOR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.36-0.85]; P = .007). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, receipt of ACEIs or ARBs was not associated with a higher risk of multivariable-adjusted mortality and severe AEs among patients with COVID-19 who had either hypertension or multiple comorbidities, supporting the recommendations of medical societies. On the contrary, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with protective benefits, particularly among patients with hypertension.

Based on the theoretical analysis, a biosensor integrating optimized critical factors was designed and fabricated. Optimizations focusing on the following aspects are considered: (1) employing n-type SiNW and controlling the impurity doping concentration of SiNW at approximately 2  1016-6  1016 atoms/cm3 to obtain a suitable charge density, (2) minimizing the SiNW width to 16.0 nm to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio, (3) using a native oxide layer on SiNW as a gate insulator to transport the captured charge molecules closer to the SiNW surface, (4) modifying the SiNW surface by 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid coupling to form a high-density self-assembled monolayer for enhancing the stability bound molecules, and (5) functionalizing the SiNW with ovalbumin molecules for specifically capturing the target immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules.

Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.

However, it is currently unknown how long infection- or vaccination-induced immunological memory will last. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal evaluation of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 up to 1 year after infection and following mRNA vaccination in naive individuals and individuals recovered from COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We found that memory cells are still detectable 8 months after vaccination, while antibody levels decline significantly, especially in naive individuals. We also found that a booster injection is efficacious in reactivating immunological memory to spike protein in naive individuals, whereas it was ineffective in previously SARS-CoV-2Cinfected individuals. Finally, we observed a similar kinetics of decay of humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 up to 1 year following natural infection in a cohort of unvaccinated individuals. CONCLUSION: Short-term persistence of humoral immunity, together with the reduced neutralization capacity versus the currently prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants, may account for reinfections and breakthrough infections. Long-lived memory B and CD4(+) T cells may protect from severe disease development. In naive individuals, a booster dose restored optimal anti-spike immunity, whereas the needs for vaccinated individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have yet to be defined.

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2020 using a web-questionnaire completed by 500 women who were pregnant during the first lockdown in France (MarchCMay 2020). Questions focused on worry caused by the pandemic, perceived-vulnerability to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and implementation of preventive measures during and after lockdown. A robust variance Poisson regression model was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for perceived vulnerability and continued poor/non-existent or decreased implementation of preventive measures. RESULTS: Participants felt significantly more vulnerable to infection than women of childbearing age who were included in a parallel study on the French general population, but were significantly less worried about the pandemic. Obese participants and those who unsuccessfully sought exchanges with healthcare professionals about their infection risk felt significantly more vulnerable (aPR=1.32 95%CI[1.05-1.64] and 1.88 [1.43-2.48], respectively). Participants with continued poor/non-existent or decreased implementation of preventive measures two months after the lockdown ended were more likely to have experienced violence during the lockdown (2.06, [1.32-3.22]), or to live in areas less affected by the pandemic (1.66 [1.05-2.62]). A good knowledge of viral transmission (0.54 [0.30-0.97]) and a high perceived-vulnerability score (0.66 [0.44-0.99]) were associated with maintained/increased implementation of preventive measures.

In recent months, efforts have been directed towards detecting, tracking, and better understanding human humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has become critical to develop robust and reliable serological assays to characterize the abundance, neutralization efficiency, and duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals. Here we review the latest knowledge on humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the benefits and limitations of currently available commercial and laboratory-based serological assays. We also highlight important serological considerations, such as antibody expression levels, stability and neutralization dynamics, as well as cross-reactivity and possible immunological back-boosting by seasonal coronaviruses. The ability to accurately detect, measure and characterize the various antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for vaccine development, manage risk and exposure for healthcare and at-risk workers, and for monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new strains of the virus. Having a thorough understanding of the benefits and cautions of standardized serological testing at a community level remains critically important in the design and implementation of future vaccination campaigns, epidemiological models of immunity, and public health measures that rely heavily on up-to-date knowledge of transmission dynamics.","output":"Humoral Responses and Serological Assays in SARS-CoV-2 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to identify the effects of behavioral factors (cognitive biases) on financial decision-making A systematic review method was implemented and selected 29 research published studies between the years 2010-2020 and were critically reviewed The main findings of the study indicate that the most common factors appear in papers were overconfidence (18), anchoring bias (11), herding effect (10) and loss aversion (9), which has a significant impact on the financial decision making process Moreover, almost half of the articles were survey-based (questionnaire), quantitative method and the rest of the articles were the qualitative and mixed-methods The study concluded that the overall impact of behavioral/psychological factors highly influence on financial decision-making However, the time and search of the key terms in the papers title were considered as the key limitations, which prevent in-depth investigation of the study For future research, those most repetitive cognitive bias should be measured during COVID-19 pandemic uncertain situation ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"The Impact of the Behavioral Factors on Investment Decision-Making: A Systemic Review on Financial Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article shows how a medical and biomedical research library changed practices, and reassessed user needs for the COVID-19 emergency It discusses changes to online education to provide user-friendly services, researcher support tailored to need and re-visioning library space;and Medical libraries were challenged to mobilize knowledge, skills and material resources to respond to this crisis","output":"Forthcoming papers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 infection has demonstrated a spectrum of complications involving vascular, inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic conditions.

MethodsWe conducted a household-based serosurvey of 4,677 individuals from 2,619 households in Chennai, India from January to May, 2021. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike (S) and nucelocapsid (N) proteins. We calculated seroprevalence using manufacturer cut-offs and using a mixture model in which individuals were assigned a probability of being seropositive based on their measured IgG, accounting for heterogeneous antibody response across individuals. ResultsThe SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence to anti-S and anti-N IgG was 62.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.6 to 63.4) and 13.5% (95% CI, 12.6 to 14.5), respectively applying the manufacturers cut-offs, with low inter-assay agreement (Cohens kappa 0.15). With the mixture model, estimated anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG seroprevalence was 64.9% (95% Credible Interval [CrI], 63.8 to 66.0) and 51.5% (95% CrI, 50.2 to 52.9) respectively, with high inter-assay agreement (Cohens kappa 0.66). Age and socioeconomic factors showed inconsistent relationships with anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG seropositivity using manufacturers cut-offs, but the mixture model reconciled these differences. In the mixture model, age was not associated with seropositivity, and improved household ventilation was associated with lower seropositivity odds. ConclusionsWith global vaccine scale-up, the utility of the more stable anti-S IgG assay may be limited due to the inclusion of the S protein in several vaccines.

Recommendations have been published to manage patients needing surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey, under the aegis of the Italian Society of Endoscopic Surgery, aims to analyze how Italian surgeons have changed their practice during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors designed an online survey that was circulated for completion to the Italian departments of general surgery registered in the Italian Ministry of Health database in December 2020. Questions were divided into three sections: hospital organization, screening policies, and safety profile of the surgical operation. The investigation periods were divided into the Italian pandemic phases I (MarchCMay 2020), II (JuneCSeptember 2020), and III (OctoberCDecember 2020). RESULTS: Of 447 invited departments, 226 answered the survey. Most hospitals were treating both COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. The reduction in effective beds dedicated to surgical activity was significant, affecting 59% of the responding units. 12.4% of the respondents in phase I, 2.6% in phase II, and 7.7% in phase III reported that their surgical unit had been closed. 51.4%, 23.5%, and 47.8% of the respondents had at least one colleague reassigned to non-surgical COVID-19 activities during the three phases. There has been a reduction in elective (> 200 procedures: 2.1%, 20.6% and 9.9% in the three phases, respectively) and emergency (< 20 procedures: 43.3%, 27.1%, 36.5% in the three phases, respectively) surgical activity. The use of laparoscopy also had a setback in phase I (25.8% performed less than 20% of elective procedures through laparoscopy). 60.6% of the respondents used a smoke evacuation device during laparoscopy in phase I, 61.6% in phase II, and 64.2% in phase III. Almost all responders (82.8% vs. 93.2% vs. 92.7%) in each analyzed period did not modify or reduce the use of high-energy devices. CONCLUSION: This survey offers three faithful snapshots of how the surgical community has reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic during its three phases.

This comprehensive review aims not only to surface the underlying ethical and legal but also social implications (ELSI) that have been overlooked in recent reviews while deserving equal attention in the development stage, and certainly ahead of implementation in healthcare. It is intended to guide various stakeholders (eg. designers, engineers, clinicians) in addressing the ELSI of AI at the design stage using the Ethics by Design (EbD) approach. METHODS: The authors followed a systematised scoping methodology and searched the following databases: Pubmed, Web of science, Ovid, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO Search (Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, APA PsycArticles, ERIC) for the ELSI of AI in healthcare through January 2021. Data were charted and synthesised, and the authors conducted a descriptive and thematic analysis of the collected data. RESULTS: After reviewing 1108 papers, 94 were included in the final analysis. Our results show a growing interest in the academic community for ELSI in the field of AI. The main issues of concern identified in our analysis fall into four main clusters of impact: AI algorithms, physicians, patients, and healthcare in general. The most prevalent issues are patient safety, algorithmic transparency, lack of proper regulation, liability & accountability, impact on patient-physician relationship and governance of AI empowered healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our review confirm the potential of AI to significantly improve patient care, but the drawbacks to its implementation relate to complex ELSI that have yet to be addressed. Most ELSI refer to the impact on and extension of the reciprocal and fiduciary patient-physician relationship.

However, traditional chemistry analytical tools such as high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) cannot meet the large-scale testing requirement in terms of cost, promptness, and convenience of use. In this article, we demonstrated ultra-sensitive and portable surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing (SERS) of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, from sewage water and achieved quantitative analysis through principal component analysis and partial least-squares regression. The SERS substrates adopted in this application were synthesized by in situ growth of silver nanoparticles on diatomaceous earth films, which show ultra-high sensitivity down to 10 parts per trillion in artificially contaminated tap water in the lab using a commercial portable Raman spectrometer. Based on training data from artificially contaminated tap water, we predicted the fentanyl concentration in the sewage water from a wastewater treatment plant to be 0.8 parts per billion (ppb). As a comparison, the HPLC-MS confirmed the fentanyl concentration was below 1 ppb but failed to provide a specific value of the concentration since the concentration was too low. In addition, we further proved the validity of our SERS sensing technique by comparing SERS results from multiple sewage water treatment plants, and the results are consistent with the public health data from our local health authority. Such SERS sensing technique with ultra-high sensitivity down to sub-ppb level proved its feasibility for point-of-care detection of illicit drugs from sewage water, which is crucial to assess public health.","output":"Sub-Part-Per-Billion Level Sensing of Fentanyl Residues from Wastewater Using Portable Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune inflammatory condition that affects multiple organs and provokes extensive and severe clinical manifestations. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the main clinical manifestations of SLE. It refers to the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, which cause kidney inflammation. Although LN seriously affects prognosis and represents a key factor of disability and death in SLE patients, its mechanism remains unclear. The NACHT, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin (PYD) domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome regulates IL-1 and IL-18 secretion and gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis and plays a key role in innate immunity. There is increasing evidence that aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream inflammatory pathways play an important part in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, including LN. This review summarizes research progress on the elucidation of NLRP3 activation, regulation, and recent clinical trials and experimental studies implicating the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of LN. Current treatments fail to provide durable remission and provoke several sides effects, mainly due to their broad immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, the identification of a safe and effective therapeutic approach for LN is of great significance. Phytochemicals are found in many herbs, fruits, and vegetables and are secondary metabolites of plants. Evidence suggests that phytochemicals have broad biological activities and have good prospects in a variety of diseases, including LN.

General examination components including inspection, guided self-palpation, range of motion, sensory and motor examination, as well as special testing are described. Although the literature is focused mainly on adult populations, we describe how each component of the exam can be reliably incorporated into a virtual appointment specific to pediatric patients. Caregivers are generally needed for most consultations, but certain maneuvers can be self-performed by older children and adolescents alone. There is general feasibility, validity, and substantial reliability in performing most examination components of the upper limbs remotely, except for the shoulder exam. Compared to those made in person, clinical diagnoses established virtually were found to be either the same or similar in most cases, and management decisions also had high agreement. Despite this, there is evidence that some pediatric providers may not be able to collect all the information needed from a telemedicine visit to make a complete clinical assessment.

METHODS: Patients receiving first-line treatment NIOS for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 in the ICU of a university hospital were included in this study; laboratory data were collected upon arrival, and 28-d outcome was recorded. After propensity score matching based on Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, age, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] at arrival, the NIOS failure rate in subjects with COVID-19 was compared to a previously published cohort who received NIOS during hypoxemic respiratory failure due to other causes. RESULTS: A total of 85 subjects received first-line treatment with NIOS. The most frequently used methods were helmet noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula; of these, 52 subjects (61%) required endotracheal intubation. Independent factors associated with NIOS failure were SAPS II score (P = .009) and serum lactate dehydrogenase at enrollment (P = .02); the combination of SAPS II score &#8805; 33 with serum lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 405 units/L at ICU admission had 91% specificity in predicting the need for endotracheal intubation.

We assessed the relative contributions of shape and texture metrics separately and together in the prediction model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computed tomography (CT) images of 735 patients with 539 malignant and 196 benign masses were segmented in this retrospective study. Thirty-three shape and 760 texture metrics were calculated per tumor. Tumor classification models using shape, texture, and both metrics were built using random forest and AdaBoost with tenfold cross-validation. Sensitivity analyses on five sub-cohorts with respect to the acquisition phase were conducted. Additional sensitivity analyses after multiple imputation were also conducted. Model performance was assessed using AUC. RESULTS Random forest classifier showed shape metrics featuring within the top 10% performing metrics regardless of phase, attaining the highest variable importance in the corticomedullary phase. Convex hull perimeter ratio is a consistently high-performing shape feature. Shape metrics alone achieved an AUC ranging 0.64-0.68 across multiple classifiers, compared with 0.67-0.75 and 0.68-0.75 achieved by texture-only and combined models, respectively. CONCLUSION Shape metrics alone attain high prediction performance and high variable importance in the combined model, while being independent of the acquisition phase (unlike texture). Shape analysis therefore should not be overlooked in its potential to distinguish benign from malignant tumors, and future radiomics platforms powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics. KEY POINTS ? Current radiomics research is heavily weighted towards texture analysis, but quantitative shape metrics should not be ignored in their potential to distinguish benign from malignant renal tumors. ? Shape metrics alone can attain high prediction performance and demonstrate high variable importance in the combined shape and texture radiomics model. ? Any future radiomics platform powered by machine learning should harness both shape and texture metrics, especially since tumor shape (unlike texture) is independent of the acquisition phase and more robust from the imaging variations.","output":"Shape and texture-based radiomics signature on CT effectively discriminates benign from malignant renal masses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Silicon has been widely used in the microelectronics industry.

METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings.

Although several cellular proteins have been previously shown to be incorporated into VSV virions, no systematic study has been done to reveal the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of Mononegavirales. RESULTS: Here we used a proteomics approach to identify cellular proteins within purified VSV virions, thereby creating a \\"snapshot\\" of one stage of virus/host interaction that can guide future experiments aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms of virus-cell interactions. Highly purified preparations of VSV virions from three different cell lines of human, mouse and hamster origin were analyzed for the presence of cellular proteins using mass spectrometry. We have successfully confirmed the presence of several previously-identified cellular proteins within VSV virions and identified a number of additional proteins likely to also be present within the virions. In total, sixty-four cellular proteins were identified, of which nine were found in multiple preparations. A combination of immunoblotting and proteinase K protection assay was used to verify the presence of several of these proteins (integrin 1, heat shock protein 90 kDa, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, annexin 2, elongation factor 1a) within the virions. CONCLUSION: This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of the order Mononegavirales. Future experiments are needed to determine which of the identified proteins have an interaction with VSV and whether these interactions are beneficial, neutral or antiviral with respect to VSV replication. Identification of host proteins-virus interactions beneficial for virus would be particularly exciting as they can provide new ways to combat viral infections via control of host components.","output":"Analysis of virion associated host proteins in vesicular stomatitis virus using a proteomics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respondents were shown brief statements (headlines) referring to various threats to the environment or to public health, and other public issues.

Unravelling the immune mechanisms acting at different levels of the colonization process might be key to understand these differences. Methods and findingsWe carried out a multi-tissue (nasal, buccal and blood; n = 156) gene expression analysis of immune-related genes from patients affected by different COVID-19 severities, and healthy controls through the nCounter technology. We then used a differential expression approach and pathways analysis to detect tissue specific immune severity signals in COVID-19 patients. Mild and asymptomatic cases showed a powerful innate antiviral response in nasal epithelium, characterized by activation of interferon (IFN) pathway and downstream cascades, successfully controlling the infection at local level. In contrast, weak macrophage/monocyte driven innate antiviral response and lack of IFN signalling activity were shown in severe cases. Consequently, oral mucosa from severe patients showed signals of viral activity, cell arresting and viral dissemination to the lower respiratory tract, which ultimately could explain the exacerbated innate immune response and impaired adaptative immune responses observed at systemic level. Results from saliva transcriptome suggest that the buccal cavity might play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and dissemination in patients with worse prognosis. ConclusionsWe found severity-related signatures in patient tissues mainly represented by genes involved in the innate immune system and cytokine/chemokine signalling. Local immune response could be key to determine the course of the systemic response and thus COVID-19 severity. Our findings provide a framework to investigate severity host gene biomarkers and pathways that might be relevant to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.","output":"A multi-tissue study of immune gene expression profiling highlights the key role of the nasal epithelium in COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthropologists examining the relationship between physician and patient in Western biomedicine have observed an inherent power discrepancy between the physician, assumed to hold scientific knowledge, and the patient, the recipient of this knowledge COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to that dynamic, as physicians, scientists and medical experts possess limited understanding of the pathophysiology, interventions and treatment of the disease Drawing on my experience as a resident physician on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, I contend that the absence of knowledge surrounding COVID-19 fosters a new form of intimacy between physician and patient through greater emphasis on subjective patient experience, increased transparency between physician and patient, and an expanding physician role beyond management of the physical disease state ?

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the recognized treatment for anxiety and is traditionally conducted face-to-face (f-CBT). The efficacy of internet-based CBT (i-CBT) for anxiety has been extensively studied, yet evidence on its cost-effectiveness is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided low-intensity i-CBT for university students with mild anxiety symptoms from the societal perspective of Hong Kong. METHODS: A 5-year Markov model was designed to compare outcomes of guided i-CBT and f-CBT in a hypothetical cohort of university students with mild anxiety symptoms. Model inputs of cost and healthcare resources associated with anxiety were retrospectively collected from a cohort of university students with anxiety symptoms. Clinical and utility model inputs were retrieved from published literature. Model outcome measures were anxiety-related total cost (including direct medical and indirect costs) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: In base-case analysis, i-CBT gained higher QALYs (2.9956 versus 2.9917) at lower total cost (US$6,101 versus US$6,246) than f-CBT. In one-way sensitivity analysis, the QALY gained by i-CBT was sensitive to the relative patient acceptance and adherence to CBT. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, i-CBT was cost-effective in 90.9% of the time at the willingness-to-pay threshold of 138,210 per QALY (3 GDP per capita in Hong Kong). The probability of i-CBT to be cost-effective was 99.9% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of zero.

Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibit potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. First, we show that resveratrol and pterostilbene antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells. Both compounds actively inhibit virus replication within infected cells as reduced virus progeny production was observed when the compound was added at post-inoculation conditions. Without replenishment of the compound, antiviral activity was observed up to roughly five rounds of replication, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of these compounds. Second, as the upper respiratory tract represents the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, we also assessed antiviral activity in airCliquid interface (ALI) cultured human primary bronchial epithelial cells, isolated from healthy volunteers. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed a strong antiviral effect in these cells up to 48 h post-infection. Collectively, our data indicate that resveratrol and pterostilbene are promising antiviral compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The ventilation rate can be automatically adjusted between the demand-controlled mode and anti-infection mode with a self-developed low-cost hardware prototype. YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm was applied for occupancy detection based on video frames from surveillance cameras. Case studies show that, compared with a traditional ventilation mode (with 15% fixed fresh air ratio), the proposed ventilation control strategy can achieve 11.7% energy saving while lowering the infection probability to 2%.

METHODS Data were collected retrospectively from patient files and were analyzed for 169 male and female patients with 220 primary inguinal hernias. All patients included had undergone surgical repair for inguinal hernia by the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach using Parietex ProGrip? meshes performed in the same clinical center in Germany. Pre-, per- and post-operative data were collected, and a follow-up after 12 months was performed prospectively. Complications, pain scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), patient satisfaction and hernia recurrence were assessed. RESULTS The only complications were minor and were post-operative: hematoma/seroma (3 cases), secondary hemorrhage through the trocar's site (2 cases), hematuria, emphysema in the inguinal regions (both sides) and swelling above the genital organs (1 case for each). At mean follow-up at 22.8 months, there were only 3 reports of hernia recurrence: 1.4 % of the hernias. Most patients (95.9 %) were satisfied or very satisfied with their hernia repair with only 1.2 % reporting severe pain (NRS score 7-10) and 3.6 % reported mild pain.

Disease activity and treatment were also assessed. Only participants with baseline negative IgG/NAb were included. RESULTS Patients with RA (N=260) and CG (N=104) had comparable median ages (59 years (50-65 years) vs 58 years (49.8-64 years), p=0.483). Patients with RA had moderate but lower SC (61.8% vs 94.2%, p<0.001) and NAb positivity (45% vs 78.6%, p<0.001) in comparison to CG after full vaccination. Baseline disease activity did not influence immunogenicity (p>0.05). After multivariate analyses, factors independently related to reduced SC were: older age (OR=0.79 (0.70-0.89) for each 5-year interval, p<0.001), methotrexate (OR=0.54 (0.29-0.98), p=0.044), abatacept (OR=0.37 (0.19-0.73), p=0.004) and number of DMARD (OR=0.55 (0.33-0.90), p=0.018).

SARS-CoV-2 presents a surface spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also infect cells of the oral mucosa, which also express the ACE2 receptor. The spike and ACE2 proteins are highly glycosylated with sialic acid modifications that direct viral-host interactions and infection. Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) has a strong affinity for sialic acid modified proteins and can be used as an antiviral agent. Here, we report that MASL targets the ACE2 receptor, decreases ACE2 expression and glycosylation, suppresses binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and decreases expression of inflammatory mediators by oral epithelial cells that cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we report that MASL also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney epithelial cells in culture. This work identifies MASL as an agent with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes.","output":"Evidence that Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) exerts pleiotropic actions on oral squamous cells with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resuscitation of cardiac arrest in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients places the healthcare staff at higher risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Educators' common reliance on such material highlights the paucity of equipoised depictions of modern ECT well suited for the training of health professionals. The authors developed and tested a new educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of a simulated patient undergoing the consent, treatment, recovery, and follow-up phases of ECT. METHODS: The didactic intervention interspersed 7 short video clips (totaling 14 min) into a 55-min lecture on treatment-resistant depression. The session, part of an intensive course of preclinical psychiatry, was delivered online through synchronous videoconferencing with Zoom. The primary outcome measure was change in the Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT (QuAKE). RESULTS: Fifty-three out of 63 (87%) eligible second-year medical students completed assessments at baseline and after exposure to the didactic intervention. QuAKE scores improved between baseline and endpoint: the Attitudes composite increased from 49.4  6.1 to 59.1  5.7 (paired t 10.65, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.69), and the Knowledge composite from 13.3  1.2 to 13.9  0.8 (paired t 3.97, p < 0.001, Cohen's d 0.23).

In the absence of specific antiviral treatments capable of neutralising the etiological agent, one therapeutic approach is to control the cytokine storm responsible for the most severe forms of the disease. The characteristic cytokine profile of severely affected patients is increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). AREAS COVERED This article discusses the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as a rationale for using the biological and targeted synthetic drugs used in rheumatology (anti-TNF, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents and baricitinib) to treat the disease, and provides key information concerning their potential benefits and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION Interleukin inhibition seems to be a promising means of treating COVID-19 patients when respiratory function declines (or even earlier) if there are laboratory data indicating the presence of a cytokine storm because the interleukins are key drivers of inflammation. However, it is important to consider the risks and benefits of biological agents carefully, and critically analyse the evidence concerning their use in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The effect of drugs used in rheumatology for treating SARS-CoV2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An observational study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Isospora suis oocysts in fecal samples from suckling piglets in Ontario, and to evaluate the relationship between the presence of I. suis oocysts and diarrhea.

Advanced insight into whether a region of interest will face elevating caseloads (requiring swift community-wide interventions) or achieve local elimination (allowing interventions to be relaxed or refocussed on controlling the importation of infections), can be the difference between decisive and ineffective policy. We propose a novel early-warning framework that formally maximises information extracted from low-incidence data to robustly infer the chances of sustained local transmission or elimination in real time, at any desired scale of investigation. Applying this framework, we decipher previously hidden disease-transmission signals from the prolonged low-incidence COVID-19 data of New Zealand, Hong Kong and Victoria state, Australia. We uncover how timely interventions averted dangerous, resurgent waves of COVID-19 and support official declarations of elimination.

Our analysis recapitulated well-known associations (e.g., 1q21 and height), revealed the pleiotropy of recurrent CNVs (e.g., 26 and 16 traits for 16p11.2-BP4-BP5 and 22q11.21, respectively), and suggested gene functionalities (e.g., MARF1 in female reproduction). Forty-eight CNV signals (38%) overlapped with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-GWASs signals for the same trait. For instance, deletion of PDZK1, which encodes a urate transporter scaffold protein, decreased serum urate levels, while deletion of RHD, which encodes the Rhesus blood group D antigen, associated with hematological traits. Other signals overlapped Mendelian disorder regions, suggesting variable expressivity and broad impact of these loci, as illustrated by signals mapping to Rotor syndrome (SLCO1B1/3), renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (HNF1B), or Charcot-Marie-Tooth (PMP22) loci. Total CNV burden negatively impacted 35 traits, leading to increased adiposity, liver/kidney damage, and decreased intelligence and physical capacity. Thirty traits remained burden associated after correcting for CNV-GWAS signals, pointing to a polygenic CNV architecture. The burden negatively correlated with socio-economic indicators, parental lifespan, and age (survivorship proxy), suggesting a contribution to decreased longevity.

Long-range contacts facilitate communication between regulatory sequences and gene promoters throughout the genome, allowing accurate gene transcription regulation during embryo development and cell differentiation. Lack of insulator function has detrimental effects often resulting in lethality. The Drosophila insulator protein Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] is not essential for viability, but plays a crucial role in female oogenesis. The mechanism(s) by which Su(Hw) promotes proper oogenesis remains unclear. To gain insight into the functional properties of chromatin insulators, we further characterize the oogenesis phenotypes of su(Hw) mutant females. We find that mutant egg chambers frequently display an irregular number of nurse cells, have poorly formed microtubule organization centers (MTOC) in the germarium, and show mislocalized Gurken (Grk) in later stages of oogenesis. Furthermore, eggshells produced by partially rescued su(Hw) mutant females exhibit dorsoventral patterning defects that are identical to defects found in spindle mutants or in piRNA pathway mutants. Further analysis reveals an excess of DNA damage in egg chambers, which is independent of activation of transposable elements, and that Gurken localization defects and oogenesis progression are partially rescued by mutations in mei-41 and chk1 genes. In addition, we show that Su(Hw) is required for chromosome integrity in dividing neuroblasts from larval brains. Together, these findings suggest that Su(Hw) plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity during germline development in Drosophila females as well as in dividing somatic cells.","output":"Mutations in the Insulator Protein Suppressor of Hairy Wing Induce Genome Instability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing opioid epidemic, rise in substance use, and social and political unrest in the US and globally has impacted how substance use-related health needs are addressed.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-?converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

The aim of this study is to compare the results of the SLNB carried out at our Center during 2012, when we stopped performing an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after the finding of a micrometastasis, with those conducted in 2018, when we started applying Z011 criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have performed a comparative retrospective observational study, including cN0 BC patients that underwent a SLNB in 2012 versus those that underwent this procedure in 2018. RESULTS 174 patients from 2012 and 165 from 2018 were studied. We found significant differences between the two groups: in 2018 there were fewer lobular invasive cancers (14 vs 28) (P < .05), a smaller mean pathological size (P < .001), a higher proportion of HER2 and triple negative tumors (28 vs 49) (P < .01) and, finally, an increase in use of neoadjuvant treatments (42.0% vs 6.7%). Regarding axillary involvement, we observed a decrease in both the presence of a positive sentinel node (24.1% in 2018 vs 42.4% in 2012) (P < .0001) as well as in the proportion of ALND performed (12.6% in 2018 vs 21.2% in 2012) and the presence of positive non sentinel nodes after a ALND (59.1% vs74.3%) (ns) CONCLUSION: Although the 2018 cohort that underwent SLNB had more aggressive tumors, there were fewer positive SN and ALND performed. This is probably due to a more accurate radiological diagnosis with ultrasound, that enables to detect cN1 cases before surgery, and to the increasing use of neoadjuvant treatments that may downstage the axilla.","output":"Indications and results of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: Changes observed in 2018 compared to 2012."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims Obesity represents a major health concern; bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment reducing and maintaining weight loss. The role of a routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) prior bariatric surgery is still debated. Moreover, in this scenario of COVID-19 pandemic, EGD is even more questionable due to the procedural risk of viral transmission. A new model of video-endoscopic capsule (VEC) recently has been introduced as a good alternative to the EGD. The aim of this study was to determine if this new capsule is an adequate diagnostic alternative to EGD in the work-up of patients selected for bariatric surgery, particularly in the setting of COVID-19. Patients and methods From January to November 2020, 27 patients selected for bariatric surgery were enrolled in this pilot study to assess for noninferiority of VEC compared to EGD in detection of upper gastrointestinal disease. Results VEC had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in identification of significant lesions of 91.3 %, 83.33 %, 98.01 %, and 51.57 %, respectively, compared with EGD as the standard criterion. The accuracy was 90.51 % (95 % CI, 73.75 %-98.18 %) and the chi-square statistic is 0.1153 ( P = 0.73). Conclusions Our report confirms the diagnostic noninferiority of VEC in preoperative work-up of patients selected for bariatric surgery, compared to EGD.

It may be responsible for tandem occlusion defined by a cervical steno-occlusive carotid wall hematoma associated with an intracranial large-vessel stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a poor clinical outcome in these cases, and endovascular treatment has not been specifically evaluated to date. Our aim was to evaluate endovascular treatment technical and clinical efficiency in this specific occlusion topography, in comparison with treatment of isolated anterior circulation stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS As part of our ongoing prospective stroke data base started in August 2009 (Prognostic Factors Related to Clinical Outcome Following Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke [RECOST] Study), we analyzed all carotid artery dissection tandem occlusion strokes and isolated anterior circulation occlusions. All patients were selected for endovascular treatment according to clinical-radiologic mismatch, NIHSS  7 and DWI-ASPECTS 5, within 6 hours after onset. For carotid artery dissection, the revascularization procedure consisted first of distal recanalization by a stent retriever in the intracranial vessel. Following assessment of the circle of Willis, internal carotid artery stent placement was only performed in case of insufficiency. Carotid artery dissection treatment efficacy, safety, and clinical outcome were compared with the results of the isolated anterior circulation occlusion cohort. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-eight patients with an anterior circulation stroke were analyzed, including 57 with tandem occlusions (22%); among them, 20 were carotid artery dissection-related occlusions (7.6%). The median age of patients with tandem occlusions with internal carotid dissection was 52.45 versus 66.85 years for isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P < .05); the mean initial NIHSS score was 17.53  4.11 versus 17.55  4.8 (P = .983). The median DWI-ASPECTS was 6.05 versus 6.64 (P = .098), and the average time from onset to puncture was 4.38 for tandem occlusions versus 4.53 hours in isolated anterior circulation occlusion (P = .704). Complication rates and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were comparable in both groups (5% versus 3%, P = .49). The duration of the procedure was significantly prolonged in case of tandem occlusion (80.69 versus 65.45 minutes, P = .030). Fourteen patients with carotid artery dissection (70%) had a 3-month mRS of  2, without a significant difference from patients with an isolated anterior circulation occlusion (44%, P = .2). Only 5 carotid artery dissections (25%) necessitated cervical stent placement. No early ipsilateral stroke recurrence was recorded, despite the absence of stent placement in 15 patients (75%) with carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical endovascular treatment of carotid artery dissection tandem occlusions is safe and effective compared with isolated anterior circulation occlusion stroke therapy. Hence, a more conservative approach with stent placement only in cases of circle of Willis insufficiency may be a reliable and safe strategy.","output":"Endovascular Management of Tandem Occlusion Stroke Related to Internal Carotid Artery Dissection Using a Distal to Proximal Approach: Insight from the RECOST Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Rapid Exchange Forum (https://www.phiri.eu/wp8 ) within the PHIRI project offers policy advisors, commission services, knowledge-brokers, researchers and stakeholders working in the pandemic response a low-threshold exchange format.

METHODS In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n=21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n=54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). RESULTS PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR= 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p<0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r= 0.59 p<0.001), LDH (r=0.52, p<0.001) and PCT (r=0.72, p<0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay.

METHODS: 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. We used two comprehensive 11-colour flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice and approved for clinical diagnostics. FINDINGS: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and ?3? T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Understanding T cell-responses in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.

With increasing access to nurse-led cervical cancer screening (CCS) in government clinics in Kenya, we investigated provider-perceived barriers and facilitators to integrating clinical breast examinations (CBEs) with ongoing CCS programs in Kisumu County, Kenya. METHODS: CCS providers within the Ministry of Health Clinics in Kisumu County, Kenya, were recruited to participate in a two-phase, sequential, mixed methods study. Knowledge of CBE guidelines was assessed with a questionnaire. Providers with significant CCS and CBE experience then completed a one-on-one interview discussing barriers and facilitators to integration. RESULTS: Sixty-nine providers from 20 randomly selected facilities participated in the survey. Providers all agreed that breast cancer screening was very important. Although 93% said that they routinely offered CBEs, only 22% of these providers screened at least eight of their last 10 patients. Forty-four percent identified four or more of five signs and symptoms of breast cancer, and 33% identified four to five risk factors. Although providers showed enthusiasm for integration of CBEs into their practices, barriers were identified and grouped into four themes: (1) fragmentation of services, (2) staffing shortage and inadequate on-the-job training, (3) limited space and referral system challenges, and (4) limited patient awareness on need for cancer screening. CONCLUSION: Addressing providers' concerns by providing routine on-the-job clinical training, improving staffing shortages, strengthening the diagnostic and treatment referral pathway, and increasing patient education are some of the first steps in facilitating integration of CBEs with CCS services in primary care clinics in Kenya.","output":"Barriers and Facilitators to Integrating Clinical Breast Examinations With Cervical Cancer Screening Programs in Outpatient Clinics in Western Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection data of IgM and IgG antibodies in 169 patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) were analyzed to evaluate differences in clinical performance between the colloidal gold method and chemiluminescence method.

Recent microbiome studies indicate that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit a specific intestinal dysbiosis that is closely associated with the disease pathophysiology. Therefore, rebalancing the intestinal microbiome using probiotics may be effective for controlling COVID-19. However, the rationale for using probiotics in COVID-19 remains unclear. In the present study, an in vitro cytokine response assay was conducted, followed by a single-arm, double-blind, prospective trial to evaluate the immunological efficacy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria against COVID-19. The present study focused on Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, which exhibit robust protective effects against infection with respiratory RNA viruses. Considering the feasibility of long-term daily intake for prophylactic purposes, healthy uninfected individuals were enrolled as subjects. Our previous pilot trial demonstrated that oral Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD), a Chinese herbal medicine formulated specifically against COVID-19, upregulates plasma TNF-, IL-1, IL-18 and IL-8. Therefore, the present study utilized the cytokine changes induced by QFPD to define the innate cytokine index QICI [=(TNF-) x (IL-1) x (IL-18) x (IL-8)/(IL-6)] as an indicator of the anti-COVID-19 immunomodulatory potential of the lactic acid bacteria. A total of 20 eligible volunteers were enrolled, 18 of whom completed the intervention. L. plantarum demonstrated a strikingly high innate cytokine index in all subjects in the in vitro cytokine response assay. In the subsequent trial, oral intake of L. plantarum significantly increased the innate cytokine index (mean fold change, 17-fold; P=0.0138) and decreased the plasma level of IL-6 (P=0.0128), a key driver of complex immune dysregulation in COVID-19, as compared with the baseline. The cytokine index increased in 16 of 18 subjects (88.9%) with considerable individual differences in the fold change (1- to 128-fold). In line with these innate cytokine changes, L. plantarum ingestion significantly enhanced the activity of natural killer cells. By contrast, oral B. longum failed to induce a significant increase in the innate cytokine index (mean fold change, 2-fold; P=0.474) as compared with the baseline. In conclusion, L. plantarum demonstrated superior QFPD-like immunomodulatory ability and mimicked the blood cytokine environment produced by early immune responses to viral infection. Daily consumption of L. plantarum as an anti-COVID-19 probiotic may be a possible option for preventing COVID-19 during the pandemic.

The aim of this analysis is to investigate the risk factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in Mexican population using survival analysis. METHODS: Our analysis includes all confirmed COVID-19 cases contained in the dataset published by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We applied survival analysis to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Mexican population. From this analysis, we plotted Kaplan-Meier curves, and constructed a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: The analysis included the register of 16,752 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with mean age 46.55  15.55 years; 58.02% (n = 9719) men, and 9.37% (n = 1569) deaths.

However, hydrochar contains greater amounts of labile fractions than traditional biochar and may exacerbate the short-term greenhouse effect. To lower the risk of greenhouse gas release due to labile fractions, optimize parameters must be determined to produce hydrochar without carbohydrate carbon. In addition, the effects of varying feedstocks and process conditions on hydrochar structure as well as its dissolved organic matter (DOM) must be investigated. Spartina alterniflora and pig manure were used to produce two hydrochars (HSAs and HPMs) and their corresponding DOM samples (DSAs and DPMs) at various production temperatures (Tp) and reaction times (tr). The carbohydrate vanishing points (CVPs) were 265 C-1 h, 250 C-2 h, and 245 C-4 h for the HSAs and 260 C-1 h, 250 C-2 h, and 250 C-4 h for the HPMs. With the isolation of DOM, 1.09-4.33% organic carbon of the hydrochar was released. The aromaticity of DSAs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. The molecular weights of the DSAs and DPMs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. This study uncovered hydrochar's molecular structure as well as the content and properties of its labile fractions.

AOM and respiratory viruses both display seasonal variation. Our objective was to examine the temporal association between circulating respiratory viruses and the occurrence of pediatric ambulatory care visits for AOM. METHODS This retrospective study included 9 seasons of respiratory viral activity (2002 to 2010) in Utah. We used Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical records to assess community respiratory viral activity via laboratory-based active surveillance and to identify children <18 years with outpatient visits and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for AOM. We assessed the strength of the association between AOM and individual respiratory viruses using interrupted time series analyses. RESULTS During the study period, 96,418 respiratory viral tests were performed; 46,460 (48%) were positive. The most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (22%), rhinovirus (8%), influenza (8%), parainfluenza (4%), human metapneumovirus (3%) and adenovirus (3%). AOM was diagnosed during 271,268 ambulatory visits. There were significant associations between peak activity of respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and office visits for AOM. Adenovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus were not associated with visits for AOM. CONCLUSIONS Seasonal respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza activity were temporally associated with increased diagnoses of AOM among children. These findings support the role of individual respiratory viruses in the development AOM. These data also underscore the potential for respiratory viral vaccines to reduce the burden of AOM.","output":"Seasonality of acute otitis media and the role of respiratory viral activity in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Many routine sinonasal procedures utilising powered instruments are regarded as aerosol-generating. This study aimed to assess how different instrument settings affect detectable droplet spread and patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery in order to identify mitigation strategies. DESIGN: Simulation series using three-dimensional (3-D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein-soaked grapes and bones, respectively. SETTING: University dry lab. PARTICIPANTS: 3-D printed sinonasal model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There were no observed fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at aspecific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Activation of the microdebrider in the presence of excess fluid in the nasal cavity (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive irrigation fluid or bleeding) resulted in detectable droplet spread. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burs resulted in detectable droplets and greater spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP but the addition of suction using a third hand technique reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity. Using the instrument outside the nasal cavity inadvertently, or when unblocking, produces greater droplet spread and requires more caution.","output":"Reducing the risks of endoscopic sinonasal surgery in the Covid-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 began to explode on a large scale around the world, with medical and health institutions around the world are facing great pressure.

Data regarding the host response within the lung are sparse. The objective is to compare alveolar and systemic inflammation response patterns, mitochondrial alarmin release, and outcomes according to ARDS etiology (i.e., COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19). METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma were obtained from 7 control, 7 non-COVID-19 ARDS, and 14 COVID-19 ARDS patients. Clinical data, plasma, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of 45 inflammatory mediators and cell-free mitochondrial DNA were measured and compared. RESULTS: COVID-19 ARDS patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a trend toward higher concentrations of plasma CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, CD40 ligand, IL-10, and GM-CSF, and ELF concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL10, granzyme B, TRAIL, and EGF in the COVID-19 ARDS group compared with the non-COVID-19 ARDS group. Plasma and ELF CXCL10 concentrations were independently associated with the number of ventilator-free days, without correlation between ELF CXCL-10 and viral load. Mitochondrial DNA plasma and ELF concentrations were elevated in all ARDS patients, with no differences between the two groups. ELF concentrations of mitochondrial DNA were correlated with alveolar cell counts, as well as IL-8 and IL-1? concentrations. CONCLUSION: CXCL10 could be one key mediator involved in the dysregulated immune response. It should be evaluated as a candidate biomarker that may predict the duration of MV in COVID-19 ARDS patients. Targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could also be considered as a new therapeutic approach.

Of 12 distinct serogroups, A, B, C, W-135 (W) and Y cause the majority of infections. The meningococcal disease burden and epidemiology in India are not reliably known. Hence, we performed a narrative review with a systematically conducted search to summarize information on meningococcal disease burden and epidemiology and vaccination recommendations for meningococcal disease in India. METHODS: A search of Medline and Embase databases was undertaken to identify relevant publications published in the last 25 years. RESULTS: Results from 32 original publications, 11 of which were case reports, suggest a significant burden of meningococcal disease and related complications. Meningococcal disease is increasingly reported among adolescents and adults, and large outbreaks have been reported in this population. Meningococcal disease in India is caused almost exclusively by serogroup A; serogroups B, C, W and Y have also been documented. Meningococcal disease burden data remain unreliable because of limited disease surveillance, insufficient laboratory capacity, misdiagnosis and prevalence of extensive antibiotic use in India. Lack of access to healthcare also increases under-reporting, thus bringing the reliability of the data into question. Conjugate meningococcal vaccines are being used for disease prevention by national governments and immunization programs globally. In India, meningococcal vaccination is recommended only for certain high-risk groups, during outbreaks and for international travelers such as Hajj pilgrims and students pursuing studies abroad. CONCLUSION: Meningococcal disease is prevalent in India but remains grossly underestimated and under-reported. Available literature largely presents outbreak data related to serogroup A disease; however, non-A serogroup disease cases have been reported. Reliable epidemiologic data are urgently needed to inform the true burden of endemic disease.

In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, accurate threat appraisal is difficult due to incomplete medical knowledge as well as complex social factors (e.g., mixed public health messages). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree to which individuals accurately perceive COVID-19 infection rates and to explore the role of COVID-19 threat perception on emotional and behavioral responses both cross sectionally and prospectively. METHODS: A community sample (N = 249) was assessed using online crowdsourcing and followed for one month. COVID-19 threat appraisal was compared with actual COVID-19 infection rates and deaths at the time of data collection in each participant's county and state. It was predicted that actual versus perceived COVID-19 infection rates would only be modestly associated. Relative to actual infection rates, perceived infection rates were hypothesized to be a better predictor of COVID-related behaviors, distress, and impairment. RESULTS: Findings indicated that relative to actual infection, perceived infection was a better predictor of COVID-related outcomes cross sectionally and longitudinally. Interestingly, actual infection rates were negatively related to behaviors cross sectionally (e.g., less stockpiling). Prospectively, these variables interacted to predict avoidance behaviors over time such that the relationship between perceived infection and avoidance was stronger as actual infection increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that perceived COVID-19 infection is significantly associated with COVID-related behaviors, distress and impairment whereas actual infection rates have a less important and perhaps even paradoxical influence on behavioral responses to the pandemic.","output":"Actual versus perceived infection rates of COVID-19: Impact on distress, behavior and disability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, ideological and political education is highly valued by the state.

Few studies evaluated the implementation of these measures and their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among pupils and staff. Aim: To describe the implementation of IPC measures in Belgian primary and secondary schools and assess its relation to the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among pupils and staff. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in a representative sample of primary and secondary schools in Belgium. Implementation of IPC measures in schools was assessed using an online questionnaire. Saliva samples were collected from pupils and staff to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Results: A variety of IPC measures (ventilation, hygiene and physical distancing) was implemented by more than 60% of primary and secondary schools with most attention for hygiene measures. Almost no differences in implementation coverage were observed between primary and secondary schools or the Dutch and French language network. Poor implementation of IPC measures was associated with an increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among pupils from 8.6% (95% CI: 4.5 - 16.6) to 16.7% (95% CI: 10.2 - 27.4) and staff from 11.5% (95% CI: 8.1 - 16.4) to 17.6% (95% CI: 11.5 - 27.0).

METHODS: Retrospective cross-sectional study using HRSA Uniform Data System (UDS) and certification files from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Joint Commission (JC). Datasets were linked through geocoding and an approximate string-matching algorithm. Predicted probability scores were regressed onto 11 clinical performance measures using 10% increments in site-level designation using beta logistic regression. RESULTS: The geocoding and approximate string-matching algorithm identified 2615 of the 6851 (41.8%) delivery sites included in the analyses as having been designated through the NCQA and/or JC. In total, 74.7% (n = 777) of the 1039 CHCs that met the inclusion criteria for the analysis managed at least one NCQA- and/or JC-designated site. A proportional increase in site-level designation showed a positive association with adherence scores for the majority of all indicators, but primarily among CHCs that designated at least 50% of its delivery sites.

CONCLUSION: Geocoding and approximate string-matching techniques offer a more reliable and nuanced approach for monitoring the association between site-level PCMH designation and clinical performance within HRSAs CHC delivery sites.

ClinVar-reported variants E1230K, E1295K, and R1739W/Q and other variants in loops IVP2-S6, IIIS1-S2, and IIIS3-S4 are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting the interface between IVP2-S6 and VSD-III as a hot spot of disease mutations. Atomic mechanisms of the channel dysfunction caused by these mutations are unknown. Here, we generated mutants E1295R, R1739E, E1295R/R1739E, and N1736R, expressed them in HEK-293T cells, and explored biophysical properties. Mutation E1295R reduced steady-state fast inactivation and enhanced steady-state slow inactivation. In contrast, mutation R1739E slightly enhanced fast inactivation and attenuated slow inactivation. Characteristics of the double mutant E1295R/R1739E were rather similar to those of the wild-type channel. Mutation N1736R attenuated slow inactivation. Molecular modeling predicted salt bridging of R1739E with the outermost lysine in the activated voltage-sensing helix IIIS4. In contrast, the loss-of-function substitution E1295R repelled R1739, thus destabilizing the activated VSD-III in agreement with our data that E1295R caused a depolarizing shift of the G-V curve. In silico deactivation of VSD-III with constraint-maintained salt bridge E1295-R1739 resulted in the following changes: 1) contacts between IIIS4 and IVS5 were switched; 2) contacts of the linker-helix IIIS4-S5 with IVS5, IVS6, and fast inactivation tripeptide IFM were modified; 3) contacts of the IFM tripeptide with helices IVS5 and IVS6 were altered; 4) mobile loop IVP2-S6 shifted helix IVP2 that contributes to the slow inactivation gate and helix IVS6 that contributes to the fast inactivation gate. The likelihood of salt bridge E1295-R1739 in deactivated VSD-III is supported by Poisson-Boltzmann calculations and state-dependent energetics of loop IVP2-S6.

We found a prevalence of PUB-I and PUB-HS TCRs of up to 50% among individuals and showed frequencies of virus-specific PUB-I and PUB-HS TCRs making up more than 10% of each virus-specific T-cell population. These findings were confirmed by using an independent TCR-database of virus-specific TCRs. We therefore conclude that the magnitude of the contribution of PUB-I and PUB-HS TCRs to these virus-specific T-cell responses is high. Because the T cells from these virus-specific memory TCR-repertoires were the result of successful control of the virus in these healthy individuals, these PUB-HS TCRs and PUB-I TCRs may be attractive candidates for immunotherapy in immunocompromised patients that lack virus-specific T cells to control viral reactivation.","output":"Public T-Cell Receptors (TCRs) Revisited by Analysis of the Magnitude of Identical and Highly-Similar TCRs in Virus-Specific T-Cell Repertoires of Healthy Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atypical depression (AtD) is contrasted with classical endogenous melancholic depression and is characterized by the presence of its uncharacteristic abnormalities, but the list of the latter varies from individual symptoms (increased appetite, weight gain, drowsiness, weakness, and anxiety) and their concurrence to syndromes accompanying depression (anxiety-phobic, obsessive-compulsive, panic attacks, derealization-depersonalization, hypochondriacal syndrome) In accordance with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, AtD is a symptom complex that includes mood reactivity and at least two of the following symptoms: hyperphagia, hypersomnia, lead-palsy, and personality sensitivity AtD has been described within a variety of disorders: recurrent depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, dysthymia, cyclothymia, and psychogenic depression The paper describes a clinical case of atypical depressive syndrome within the framework of type 2 bipolar disorder in a 51-year-old patient AtD was concurrent with dermatitis herpetiformis (Dhring's disease) in some depressive episodes;it was accompanied by various somatic complaints in other cases The latest episode of AtD occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and included obvious reactive anxiety-phobic disorders A detailed clinical and psychopathological analysis of history data, mental state, and ongoing therapy was carried out, which clearly reflects difficulties in the differential diagnosis of AtD and the use of adequate treatment ? 2020 Ima-Press Publishing House All rights reserved","output":"Atypical depression in bipolar affective disorder: A clinical case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, and the number of worldwide cases continues to rise.

His electrocardiogram showed a new onset of atrial flutter with spontaneous reversal to sinus rhythm (narrow QRS complex and normal atrioventricular conduction). The dyspnoea was worse with the patient sitting and was better when lying supine. Also, he report back pain associated to his major kyphoscoliosis. Results of chest radiography and blood test were normal. The arterial blood gas test revealed a hypocapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure, therefore the patient oxygen supplementation with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was started, but peripheral oxygen saturation was persistently below 88% despite the high flow oxygenation. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal (NP) swab (ruling out SARS-CoV-2), high-resolution computed tomography (which was not pathologic), and computed tomography angiography (excluding pulmonary embolism). A transthoracic echocardiography was performed showing concentric hypertrophy, left atriomegaly and severe aortic ectasia of the root and of his ascending part, normal pulmonary pression and an aneurism of the interatrial septum with the presence of right-to-left shunt after using agitate saline contrast with Valsalva maneuver. Transesophageal echocardiography (TTE) confirmed the presence of severe structural interatrial septal abnormality with wide left convex aneurysm and an atrial septum defect (ASD) as ostium secundum, causing severe bidirectional shunt. Therefore, the patient underwent a successful transcatheter closure of secundum ASD with device Amplatzer Septal Occluder 018, while monitored with cardiac catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. After few days, the patient was discharged at home without oxygen therapy. At the 3-month follow-up visit he reported no respiratory symptoms. Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is an uncommon disorder characterized by dyspnoea and hypoxemia that occurs when the patient is sitting or standing and disappear quickly when recumbent. POS is characterized by both an anatomic and a functional component. The anatomic element is typically an interatrial communication such as ASD or Patent Foramen Ovale, which cause blood shunt left-to-right due to a higher pressure in left atrium and a greater compliance of the right ventricle, in the presence of normal pulmonary artery pressure. The syndrome occurs when a functional element, such as an increased atrial pressure or a decreased compliance of the right ventricle, reverses the flow. The shunts are often small and could remain asymptomatic: the high left atrial pressure let the defect close until there is a reverse pression which stretched atrial septum in particular in the upright position. In fact, when the patient is standing, the inferior vena cava comes in line with the defect increasing the right-to-left flow, sparking the respiratory symptoms. This could be linked to a cardiac or an extracardiac condition; in this case the presence of kyphoscoliosis and severe aortic ectasia of the root and of his ascending part, played an important role. The diagnosis is mainly made by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization to verify the mismatch in oxygen saturation between the pulmonary vein and the aorta. The diagnosis of POS is challenging, often considered only after other possible diagnosis is excluded. When POS is triggered by an interatrial defect in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension, the usual treatment is a percutaneous or surgical closure.","output":"486 A blue man standing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether partner bereavement is associated with adverse cardiovascular and kidney-related events in people with reduced kidney function. DESIGN: Two parallel matched cohort studies using linked routinely collected health data. SETTING: England (general practices and hospitals using linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics, and Office of National Statistics) and Denmark (hospitals and community pharmacies using the Danish National Patient, Prescription and Education Registries and the Civil Registration System). PARTICIPANTS: Bereaved people with reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60mL/min/1.73m(2) (England) or hospital-coded chronic kidney disease (Denmark)) and non-bereaved people with reduced kidney function similarly defined, matched on age, sex, general practice (England), and county of residence (Denmark) and followed-up from the bereavement date of the exposed person. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) hospitalization, or death. RESULTS: In people with reduced kidney function, we identified 19,820 (England) and 5,408 (Denmark) bereaved individuals and matched them with 134,828 (England) and 35,741 (Denmark) non-bereaved individuals. Among the bereaved, the rates of hospitalizations (per 1000 person-years) with CVD were 31.7 (95%-CI: 30.5C32.9) in England and 78.8 (95%-CI: 74.9C82.9) in Denmark; the rates of hospitalizations with AKI were 13.2 (95%-CI: 12.5C14.0) in England and 11.2 (95%-CI: 9.9C12.7) in Denmark; and the rates of death were 70.2 (95%-CI: 68.5C72.0) in England and 126.4 (95%-CI: 121.8C131.1) in Denmark. After adjusting for confounders, we found increased rates of CVD (England, HR 1.06 [95%-CI: 1.01C1.12]; Denmark, HR 1.10 [95%-CI: 1.04C1.17]), of AKI (England, HR 1.20 [95%-CI: 1.10C1.31]; Denmark HR 1.36 [95%-CI: 1.17C1.58]), and of death (England, HR 1.10 [95%-CI: 1.05C1.14]; Denmark HR 1.20 [95%-CI: 1.15C1.25]) in bereaved compared with non-bereaved people.

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD: The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS: The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm  1.99 and 0.94  0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1%  0.115 and 98.5%  0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3%  0.110 and 96.1%  0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8%  0.09 and 14%  0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.","output":"AAR-LN-DQ: Automatic Anatomy Recognition based Disease Quantification in Thoracic Lymph Node Zones via FDG PET/CT images without Nodal Delineation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is a meta-analysis of empirical studies in social media strategies and reputation research The research goal is to give a clearer idea of the broad directions and paradigm shifts in Twitter usage discourse over the years Its major goal is to examine thematic trends, theoretical framework and methodology that have characterized the discourse Sixty relevant articles were identified, coded and content-analyzed Findings revealed that dominant themes include stakeholder perceptions of communication strategies, social network sites, dynamics of global pandemic (i e Covid-19 pandemic) and corporate reputation Also, experiment, case study and survey are the dominant research methods that characterize research in this discourse Findings also revealed large domination of the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) and the Image Repair Theory However, research in this area lacks significant empirical evidence from Africa and Nigeria in particular, where the global pandemic seems to be a recurring phenomenon The majority of the reviewed journal articles were conducted in the Western clime, with little attention on Africa Scholarship needs to move beyond this point to provide a holistic and balanced view on the crisis by exploring cases in Africa and particularly, in Nigeria This gap will provide an opportunity for understanding the global pandemic (i e Covid-19) dynamics in Africa and will further determine whether findings can be consistent across the world","output":"Twitter usage during global pandemic and corporate reputation in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is widely believed that the global economy is experiencing unprecedented challenges by the Covid-19.

Unscheduled healthcare constitutes a substantial portion of healthcare delivery. A systematic review was conducted to establish the factors that influence parents' decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. The systematic review question was \\"What are the factors that influence the decision making of parents and families seeking unscheduled paediatric healthcare?\\" METHOD: Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, EconLit) and four grey literature databases (Proquest, Lenus, OpenGrey, Google Scholar) were searched. The titles and abstracts of 3746 articles were screened and full-text screening was performed on 177 of these articles. Fifty-six papers were selected for inclusion in the review. Data relating to different types of unscheduled health services (namely primary care, the emergency department and out-of-hours services) were extracted from these articles. A narrative approach was used to synthesise the extracted data. RESULTS: Several factors were identified as influencing parental preferences and decision making when seeking unscheduled healthcare for their children. A number of the included studies identified pre-disposing factors such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) as impacting the healthcare-seeking behaviour of parents. Unscheduled healthcare use was often initiated by the parent's perception that the child's condition was urgent and their need for reassurance. The choice of unscheduled service was influenced by a myriad of factors such as: waiting times, availability of GP appointments, location of the ED, and the relationship that the parent or caregiver had with their GP. CONCLUSION: Policy and planning initiatives do not always reflect how patients negotiate the health system as a single entity with numerous entry points. Altering patients' behaviour through public health initiatives that seek to improve, for instance, health literacy or reducing emergency hospital admissions through preventative primary care requires an understanding of the relative importance of factors that influence behaviour and decision making, and the interactions between these factors.","output":"Factors that influence family and parental preferences and decision making for unscheduled paediatric healthcare - systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasonography (LUS), an imaging modality quickly performed, interpreted, and integrated by the treating physician at the bedside, is a particularly useful tool for acutely ill patients.

This article presents key findings for the City and County of Honolulu (CCH). A total of 5598 CCH residents responded. Approximately half of these respondents reported they or their household members experienced reduced work hours or lost their job as a result of COVID-19. In all questions related to paying for essential living costs, at the time of the survey, the percentage of participants who expected to have future problems nearly doubled. Those preparing for school in the fall school semester expected challenges centered on insufficient funds to purchase school supplies, lack of available face-coverings, and language barriers. Financial assistance, rental assistance, and food assistance seemed to be more difficult to apply for compared to health care services. The most common reasons for difficulty with applications noted by residents included that they could not figure out how to complete the form, did not have all the documents, or could not get through on the telephone. About one-half of CCH participants reported feeling nervous more than half of the days or nearly every day in the past 2 weeks. Most perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate to very high.

In this study, we compared the efficacy of oxygen masks and Venturi masks in the management of hypoxemia in pediatric patients. METHODS A total of 65 children, aged 3-36 months, diagnosed with HALRI, were enrolled. Patients were allocated into groups, via simple alternate randomization, to receive oxygen through an oxygen mask or through a Venturi mask. Respiratory rate, heart rate, retraction, blood gas parameters, oxygen saturation, length of hospitalization, and oxygenation were recorded before and after oxygen treatment. RESULTS After 24 h of treatment, respiratory rate was significantly lower among patients in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group. Duration of supplemental oxygen and length of hospitalization were significantly lower in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group.

This is a smallbut expandingbody of literature emerging as sober curiosity and mindful drinking are trending in Western contexts such as the UK, particularly amongst young women who do not identify with traditional, binary recovery language such as alcoholic and addict. This review highlights the gaps in research and concludes that further research regarding these new treatment pathways, and women's experiences when utilising them, must be conducted to provide more evidence-based options for women who want to address problematic drinking. Public health bodies could also learn more effective strategies from these innovative solutions to reduce alcohol consumption generally.","output":"Online Sobriety Communities for Women's Problematic Alcohol Use: A Mini Review of Existing Qualitative and Quantitative Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a menstrual cycle disorder that frequently appears in women. As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus pandemic, the school from home program was implemented, which could affect physical activity and anxiety and therefore increase the incidence of PMS. This cross-sectional research analyzed the relationship between physical activity and anxiety with PMS in adolescents. The population was 221 adolescent girls in Surabaya, Indonesia. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the 143 respondents. The independent variables were physical activity and anxiety while the dependent variable was PMS. The data was collected using a questionnaire and analyzed by the Spearman Rho test with a level of significance <0.05. The results showed no significant correlation between physical activity and PMS among adolescents, however there was a significant correlation between anxiety and PMS in adolescents (p=0.000;r=0.463). Adolescents with anxiety have higher risk of PMS. The higher level of anxiety will be the more severe the symptoms of PMS. ? 2022, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

As people, especially older adults, self-quarantined and sheltered in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of usability-in-place became clear. To understand the remote use of technology in an ecologically valid manner, researchers and others must be able to test usability remotely. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to review practical approaches for and findings about remote usability testing, particularly remote usability testing with older adults. METHODS: We performed a rapid review of the literature and reported on available methods, their advantages and disadvantages, and practical recommendations. This review also reported recommendations for usability testing with older adults from the literature. RESULTS: Critically, we identified a gap in the literaturea lack of remote usability testing methods, tools, and strategies for older adults, despite this populations increased remote technology use and needs (eg, due to disability or technology experience). We summarized existing remote usability methods that were found in the literature as well as guidelines that are available for conducting in-person usability testing with older adults.

During the COVID\\\\19 response, PEPFAR worked with ministries of health to scale up MMD and expand eligibility to new groups of PLHIV, including children and pregnant/breastfeeding women. We analysed PEPFAR program data to understand the impact of the policy changes on actual practice. METHODS: We conducted a desk review in 21 PEPFAR\\\\supported countries to identify and collect official documentation released between March and June 2020 addressing changes to MMD guidance during the COVID\\\\19 response. MMD coverage, the proportion of all ART clients on MMD, was assessed in the calendar quarters preceding the COVID\\\\19 response (Q4 2019, OctoberCDecember 2019; and Q1, JanuaryCMarch 2020) and the quarters following the start of the response (Q2 2020, AprilCJune 2020; Q3 2020, JulyCSeptember, 2020; Q4 2020, OctoberCDecember 2020). We used the two\\\\proportion Z\\\\test to test for differences in MMD coverage pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 (Q4 2019) and during implementation of COVID\\\\19 policy adaptations (Q2 2020). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As of June 2020, 16 of the 21 PEPFAR\\\\supported countries analysed adapted MMD policy or promoted intensified scale\\\\up of MMD in response to COVID\\\\19. MMD coverage for all clients on ART grew from 49% in Q4 2019 pre\\\\COVID\\\\19 to 72% in Q2 2020 during COVID\\\\19; among paediatric clients (< 15), MMD coverage increased from 27% to 51% in the same period. Adaptations to MMD policy were associated with a significantly accelerated growth in the proportion of clients on MMD (p < 0.001) for all populations, irrespective of age and dispensing interval. CONCLUSIONS: Access to MMD markedly expanded during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, supporting treatment continuity while mitigating exposure to COVID\\\\19 at health facilities. This model is beneficial in public health emergencies and during disruptions to the healthcare system.

Since the RAAS can induce and modulate pro-inflammatory responses, it could play a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Thus, we aimed to determine the levels of plasma renin and aldosterone as indicators of RAAS activation in a series of consecutively admitted patients for Covid-19 in our clinic. METHODS: Plasma renin and aldosterone levels were measured, among the miscellaneous investigations needed for Covid-19 management, early after admission in our clinic. Disease severity was assessed using a seven-category ordinal scale. Primary outcome of interest was the severity of patients' clinical courses. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. At inclusion, 12 patients had mild clinical status, 25 moderate clinical status and 7 severe clinical status. In univariate analyses, aldosterone and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at inclusion were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical course as compared to those with mild or moderate course (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only aldosterone and CRP levels remained positively associated with severity. We also observed a positive significant correlation between aldosterone and CRP levels among patients with an aldosterone level greater than 102.5 pmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Both plasmatic aldosterone and CRP levels at inclusion are associated with the clinical course of Covid-19.

The question to be explored was: Are there discernable differences in sleep between the normal operational environment and the stay-at-home condition? METHODS: This international prospective study analyzed results from the sleep-wake patterns questionnaire, daily logs, and interviews. Surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers (age 15C60 y) with stay-at-home for a month or more, without previous sleep disorders and mood-related complaints; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. RESULTS: We analyzed 3,787 subjects with average stay-at-home of 659 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first ten days when the difference between weekdays and weekends disappeared and changes occurred in napping habits. The majority of the participants (66.8%) shifted toward eveningness when the self-selected sleep was possible and 1,869 volunteers appeared to be owls (49.4%), 823 (21.7%) exercised typical sleep, 478 (12.6%) were larks, and 617 (16.3%) participants were completely desynchronized to the end of stay-at-home. In addition, 497 participants (13.1%) alternated their sleep habits. The most of the desynchronized participants (n=414) were older than 50 years (age correlation r=0.80), and predominantly males (n=297, r=0.76).

Sometimes by the time a successful vaccine is out for public use, the outbreak may already be over.

Convalescent blood therapy and covalent plasma therapy have often proved effective in reducing mortality, however, the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in these therapies have been overlooked. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), CD4+ T memory cells, CD8+ T memory cells, and memory B-Cells all play a vital role in sustainable defense and subsequent recovery. This report incorporates all these aspects by suggesting a novel treatment therapy called selective convalescent leukapheresis and transfusion (SCLT) and also highlights its potential in vaccination.

The molecular mechanisms of their antiviral effects mainly consist in the inhibition of viral neuraminidase, proteases and DNA/RNA polymerases, as well as in the modification of various viral proteins. Mixtures of different flavonoids or combination of flavonoids with antiviral synthetic drugs provide an enhancement of their antiviral effects. Recent strategies in drug delivery significantly contribute to overcoming the low bioavailability of flavonoids.

We tested three commercial sVNT (a qualitative immunochromatographic test and two quantitative immunoassays named YHLO and TECO) together with a conventional anti-spike IgG assay (bioMerieux) in comparison with an in-house plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) using the original 19A strain and different variants of concern (VOC), on a panel of 306 sera from naturally-infected or vaccinated patients. The qualitative test was rapidly discarded because of poor sensitivity and specificity. Areas under the curve of YHLO and TECO assays were, respectively, 85.83 and 84.07 (p-value >0.05) using a positivity threshold of 20 for PRNT50, and 95.63 and 90.35 (p-value =0.02) using a threshold of 80. However, the performances of YHLO and bioMerieux were very close for both thresholds, demonstrating the absence of added value of sVNT compared to a conventional assay for the evaluation of the presence of NAb in seropositive subjects. In addition, the PRNT50 assay showed a reduction of NAb titers towards different VOC in comparison to the 19A strain that could not be appreciated by the commercial tests. Despite the good correlation between the anti-spike antibody titer and the titer of NAb by PRNT50, our results highlight the difficulty to distinguish true NAb among the anti-RBD antibodies with commercial user-friendly immunoassays.","output":"Evaluation of Commercial Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Assays in seropositive subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Sepsis survivors have a higher risk of rehospitalisation and of long-term mortality. We assessed the rate, diagnosis, and independent predictors for rehospitalisation in adult sepsis survivors. METHODS: We searched for non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE (OVID interface, 1992COctober 2019). The search strategy used controlled vocabulary terms and text words for sepsis and hospital readmission, limited to humans, and English language. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. RESULTS: The literature search identified 12,544 records. Among 56 studies (36 full and 20 conference abstracts) that met our inclusion criteria, all were non-randomised studies. Studies most often report 30-day rehospitalisation rate (mean 21.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.6C25.4%; N = 36 studies reporting 6,729,617 patients). The mean (95%CI) rehospitalisation rates increased from 9.3% (8.3C10.3%) by 7 days to 39.0% (22.0C59.4%) by 365 days. Infection was the most common rehospitalisation diagnosis. Risk factors that increased the rehospitalisation risk in sepsis survivors were generic characteristics such as older age, male, comorbidities, non-elective admissions, hospitalisation prior to index sepsis admission, and sepsis characteristics such as infection and illness severity, with hospital characteristics showing inconsistent associations. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate for rehospitalisation rates and low for risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rehospitalisation events are common in sepsis survivors, with one in five rehospitalisation events occurring within 30 days of hospital discharge following an index sepsis admission.

METHODS: In collaboration with gay health specialists, we screened for HCV seropositivity in Viennese MSM between 2019 and 2020. Barrier-free HCV-RNA-PCR tests, transient elastography (TE) and immediate access to DAA treatment were offered. RESULTS: A total of 310 HCV-seropositive patients were identified. Of those, 145 could be contacted and 109 attended their appointment at our clinic. HIV-coinfection was highly prevalent in our cohort (n = 86/145; 78.9%), while pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was taken by 21.7% (n = 5/23) of non-HIV patients.

We aimed first to estimate the self-perception of stress as defined by the 10-item Perceived Stress Score (PSS-10), at the beginning of the pandemic in France, among GPs from the Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes, a french administrative area severely impacted by COVID-19. Second, we aimed to identify factors associated with a self-perceived stress (PSS-10 &#8805; 27) among socio-demographic characteristics of GPs, their access to reliable information and to personal protective equipment during the pandemic, and their exposure to well established psychosocial risk at work.

In complete cases, factors associated with stress (PSS-10 &#8805; 27) were investigated using logistic regression, adjusted on gender, age and practice location. A supplementary analysis of the verbatims was made. RESULTS: Overall, 898 individual answers were collected, of which 879 were complete.

It was several decades ago, when limbal epithelial SCs (LSCs) that regenerate the corneal epithelium were one of the first sporadic, quiescent SCs ever discovered. However, LSC dynamics, heterogeneity and genetic signature are largely unknown. Moreover, recent accumulating evidence strongly suggested that epithelial SCs are actually abundant, frequently dividing cells that display stochastic behavior. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the murine limbal epithelium by single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative lineage tracing. The generated data provided an atlas of cell states of the corneal epithelial lineage, and particularly, revealed the co-existence of two novel LSC populations that reside in separate and well-defined sub-compartments. In the outer limbus, we identified a primitive widespread population of quiescent LSCs (qLSCs) that uniformly express Krt15/Gpha2/Ifitm3/Cd63 proteins, while the inner limbus host prevalent active LSCs (aLSCs) co-expressing Krt15-GFP/Atf3/Mt1-2/Socs3. Analysis of LSC population dynamics suggests that while qLSCs and aLSCs possess different proliferation rates, they both follow similar stochastic rules that dictate their self-renewal and differentiation. Finally, T cells were distributed in close proximity to qLSCs. Indeed, their absence or inhibition resulted in the loss of quiescence and delayed wound healing. Taken together, we propose that divergent regenerative strategies are tailored to properly support tissue-specific physiological constraints. The present study suggests that in the case of the cornea, quiescent epithelial SCs are abundant, follow stochastic rules and neutral drift dynamics.","output":"Capturing limbal epithelial stem cell population dynamics, signature, and their niche"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Child Care Center is a form of non-formal Early Childhood Education service whose existence continues to grow with the needs of today's society.

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with increased COVID-19 severity and evaluate the current antiviral drugs, especially in severe patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study performed at the No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan (Wuhan, China) with hospitalized patients confirmed with COVID-19 from January 11 to March 13, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors of severe COVID. Treatments of antivirus drugs were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 550 patients, 292 (53.1%) were female and 277 (50.4%) were > 60 years old. The most common symptom was fever (n = 372, 67.7%), followed by dry cough (n = 257, 46.7%), and dyspnea (n = 237, 43.1%), and fatigue (n = 224, 40.7%). Among the severe patients, 20.2% required invasive ventilator support and 18.0% required non-invasive ventilator. The identified risk factors for severe cases were: age &#8805; 60 years (odds ratio (OR) =3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-8.08, P = 0.028), D-dimer > 0.243 g/ml (OR = 2.734, 95%CI: 1.012-7.387, P = 0.047), and low oxygenation index (OR = 0.984, 95%CI: 0.980-0.989, P < 0.001). In severe cases, the benefits (relief of clinical symptoms, clinical outcome, and discharge rate) of arbidol alone was 73.3%, which was better than ribavirin (7/17, 41.2%, P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Age > 60 years, D-dimer > 0.243 g/ml, and lower oxygenation index were associated with severe COVID-19.

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the effects of ICI treatment on COVID-19 prognosis, including mortality, severity, and any other prognosis-related outcomes. METHODS: Eligible studies published up to 27 February 2021 were included and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effect size along with its 95% confidence intervals. The quality of body evidence was evaluated using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving a total of 2826 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included in the systematic review. We discovered a moderate-to-high quality of evidence that ICI was not associated with a higher mortality risk, while the other outcomes yielded a very low-to-low-evidence quality. Although our findings indicated that ICI did not result in a higher risk of severity and hospitalization, further evidence is required to confirm our findings. In addition, we discovered that prior exposure to chemoimmunotherapy may be linked with a higher risk of COVID-19 severity (OR 8.19 [95% CI: 2.67-25.08]; I2 = 0%), albeit with small sample size. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that ICI treatment should not be adjourned nor terminated during the current pandemic. Rather, COVID-19 vigilance should be increased in such patients. Further studies with larger cohorts and higher quality of evidence are required to substantiate our findings.

Family resilience is the ability of a family to adapt to crisis and can be a protective factor against stress and negative affect. While there have been calls to address family resilience during the pandemic, there is a lack of empirical study on its benefit. In this dyadic observational study, we sought to investigate the concordance of family members psychological responses to COVID-19, whether dyad members risk factors (COVID-19 exposure and financial impact) mutually affected each others psychological responses, and importantly, whether family resilience was a significant factor in these responses. A total of 200 family dyads from the same household completed the Family Resilience Assessment Scale and questionnaires on COVID-19 threat perception, impacts, and exposure. We found concordant dyad responses for COVID-19 threat perception, but not for psychological impact. Using the Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model framework, we found that ones psychological impact was affected by the financial impact from both dyad members. After controlling for risk factors and demographic covariates, we found that family resilience significantly associated with lower COVID-19 psychological impact, though not with threat perception. The findings suggest that both family and individual factors need to be addressed and there may be benefit in addressing multilevel risk and protective factors using an ecological systems approach, which may help prepare the population for future crises.","output":"Family Resilience and Psychological Responses to COVID-19: A Study of Concordance and Dyadic Effects in Singapore Households"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus pandemic of 2019C20 (COVID-19) affected multiple social determinants of health (SDH) across the globe, including in New Zealand, exacerbating health inequities.

This study combined a scoping review with a causal loop diagram to further understanding of the connections between SDH, pandemic measures, and both short- and long-term outcomes in New Zealand. The causal loop diagram showed the reinforcing nature of structural SDH, such as colonization and socio-economic influences, on health inequities. While balancing actions taken by government eliminated COVID-19, the diagram showed that existing structural SDH inequities could increase health inequities in the longer term, unless the opportunity is taken for socio-economic policies to be reset. Such policy resets would be difficult to implement, as they are at odds with the current socio-economic system. The causal loop diagram highlighted that SDH significantly influenced the dynamics of the COVID-19 impact and response, pointing to a need for purposeful systemic action to disrupt the reinforcing loops which increase health inequities over time.

Nanopore/slit is one of the recent and successful tools for DNA sequencing. Passage of DNA along the pores creates non-uniform ionic currents which creates non-uniform electric and magnetic fields, accordingly. Sensing the electric field is usually used for sequencing application. We suggest to use the magnetic field induced by pressure-driven ionic currents as a secondary signal. We systematically compared the induced magnetic field of nanopores and nanoslits with equal cross-sectional area. The 3D magnetic field is numerically obtained by solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck, Ampere, and NavierCStokes equations. As expected, the maximum value of the maximum magnetic flux occurs near the wall and inside the channel, and increasing the pressure gradient along the pore/slit increases the flowrate and magnetic field, consequently. At a given pressure difference across the pore/slit, nanopores are better than nanoslits in sensing the magnetic flux. For example, by applying 2 MPa across the pore/slit, the maximum magnetic flux density for nanopore, nanoslit [Formula: see text] and nanoslit [Formula: see text] are 1.10 pT, 1.08 pT and 0.45 pT, accordingly. Also, at a given flowrate across the pore/slit, nanoslits are the better choice.

The newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 outbreak, which is a real threat to human health and life. The world has been struggling with this epidemic for about a year, yet there are still no targeted drugs and effective treatments are very limited. Due to the long process of developing new drugs, reposition of existing ones is one of the best ways to deal with an epidemic of emergency infectious diseases. Among the existing drugs there are candidates which are potentially able to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus infection with the virus. Some therapeutics target several proteins, and many diseases share molecular paths. In such cases, the use of existing pharmaceuticals for more than one purposes can reduce the time needed to design new drugs. The aim of this review was to analyse the key targets of viral infection and potential drugs acting on them, as well as to discuss various strategies and therapeutic approaches, including the possible use of natural products. We highlight the approach based on increasing the involvement of human deaminases, particularly APOBEC deaminases in editing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This can reduce the cytosine content in the viral genome leading to the loss of its integrity. We also indicate the nucleic acid technologies as potential approaches for COVID-19 treatment.

METHODS: Secondary analysis from the PRoVENT-COVID study. The PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicenter, retrospective observational study done at 22 intensive care units in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The aim was to quantify the dynamics and determine the prognostic value of surrogate markers of wasted ventilation in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS. RESULTS: A total of 927 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19-related ARDS were included in this study. Estimations of wasted ventilation such as the estimated dead space fraction (by Harris-Benedict and direct method) and ventilatory ratio were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors at baseline and during the following days of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001). The end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio was lower in non-survivors than in survivors (p < 0.001). As ARDS severity increased, mortality increased with successive tertiles of dead space fraction by Harris-Benedict and by direct estimation, and with an increase in the VR. The same trend was observed with decreased levels in the tertiles for the end-tidal-to-arterial PCO2 ratio. After adjustment for a base risk model that included chronic comorbidities and ventilation- and oxygenation-parameters, none of the dead space estimates measured at the start of ventilation or the following days were significantly associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant impairment of ventilation in the early course of COVID-19-related ARDS but quantification of this impairment does not add prognostic information when added to a baseline risk model.
