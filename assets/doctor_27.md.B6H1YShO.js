The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of BMI in metastatic colorectal cancer pts treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bev or FOLFIRI/FOLFOX plus bev in the TRIBE and TRIBE-2 trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1160 pts enrolled in TRIBE and TRIBE-2 trials were included. Baseline height and weight were used to assign pts to one of the following BMI categories: underweight (group A = BMI <18.5 kg/m2; 52 pts), normal (group B = BMI 18.5-29.9 kg/m2; 952 pts) and obese (group C > 30 kg/m2; 156 pts). RESULTS: In our population, no differences in terms of PFS (P = .43) or OS (P = .99) resulted between 3 groups. No interaction effect between treatment arm and BMI was evident in terms of PFS (Group A HR: 0.65 [95%CI: 0.36-1.16]; Group B HR: 0.77 [95%CI: 0.67-0.88]; Group C HR: 0.67 [95%CI: 0.48-0.93]; P for interaction = .75) or OS (Group A HR: 0.57 [95%CI: 0.29-1.12]; Group B HR: 0.85 [95%CI: 0.73-0.99];Group C HR: 0.69 [95%CI: 0.48-1.01] P for interaction = .36). No statistically significant difference in terms of dose reductions due to toxicities were found according to BMI in the overall population (P = .48) and in pts treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bev (P = .57). CONCLUSION: BMI was neither prognostic or predictive for PFS and OS in our population.

The objective of this study was to develop a time-dependent dynamic simulation model to forecast the COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, and to assess the effect of social distancing on epidemic spread. The model used was the 'Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered' framework which incorporated appropriate compartments relevant to interventions such as quarantine, isolation and treatment. In a low-intervention scenario including only 2-week isolation for international travelers and their contacts, the model estimated a maximum peak of nearly 90 000 symptomatic cases for early May. For an intervention scenario with mandatory quarantine during a 5-month period, the curve of cases flattened and receded as the proportion of quarantined individuals increased. The maximum peak was expected to appear between May 8 and Jul 8 depending on the quarantine strategy, and the average number of infectious symptomatic cases were 46 840, 30 494, 23 164, 16 179, and 13 196 when 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the population remained in a 5-month-term continuous quarantine, respectively. Only mandatory quarantine was able to delay the maximum peak of infection and significantly reduce the total number of infected individuals and deaths at a 150-day term. The interruption of the quarantine before 120 days of its beginning could generate an even more serious outbreak 30 days later, and surpass the scarce medical resources available for the intensive care of critically-ill patients.","output":"Forecasting the effect of social distancing on COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many changes in the nutritional care process as a result of the social distancing measures imposed, especially in the assessment of nutritional status, in which obtaining anthropometric measures is necessary.

To estimate the number of COVID-19 cases that would have occurred in the vaccine era in absence of vaccination, we applied a statistical model that estimated the relationship of COVID-19 cases in the pre-vaccine era between the unvaccinated age group (<12 years) and vaccine-eligible groups ([]12 years) to COVID-19 case data after the start of vaccination. The primary study outcome was the difference between predicted number of COVID-19 cases in absence of vaccination and observed COVID-19 cases with vaccination. As a sensitivity analysis, we developed a second independent model that estimated the number of vaccine-averted COVID-19 cases by applying published data on vaccine effectiveness to data on COVID-19 vaccine administration and estimated risk of COVID-19 over time.

This system was represented through a causal loop diagram, where the identification of leverage points was done using network analysis. RESULTS: 45 determinants interplaying through 56 linkages, and three subsystems: urbanization-related transmission, infection-prone behaviour and healthcare efficiency, and Plasmodium resistance were identified.

Hybrid procedures such as minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery (MA-NOS) are the safe progression to pure NOTES. This report describes the first clinical case of a transrectal MA-NOS total colectomy. METHODS The patient was a 36-year-old man with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who experienced failure of immunosuppressive therapy. The standard steps of laparoscopic total colectomy were respected, with basic triangulation maintained throughout the case. A transrectal endoscopic device was used for optic assistance, colon dissection, ileum section, and specimen retrieval. Transrectal MA-NOS total colectomy was assisted by three laparoscopic ports: a 12-mm port used as the terminal ileostomy site, a 2-mm needle epigastric port, and a 5-mm umbilical port used as a drain site at the final intervention. No intraoperative complications occurred. RESULTS The total operative time was 240 min. Oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 2.

We explored the relative risk of mortality from readily available demographics to identify the population at the highest risk. RESULTS: The published studies specifically assessing the risk of healthcare workers had limited demographics available; therefore, we explored the general population in the literature. Clinician demographics: Mortality increased with increasing age from 50 years onwards. Male sex at birth, and people of black and minority ethnicity groups had higher susceptibility to both hospitalisation and mortality. Comorbid disease. Vascular disease, renal disease, diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease further increased risk.

The disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. These diagnostic methods are laborious and time-consuming. The present study was aimed to evaluate the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid, early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. METHODS: A one-step single tube accelerated quantitative RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by targeting the Env gene of WNV. The gene amplification was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63C for 60 min in both real time turbidimeter as well as routine laboratory water bath/dry heating bath. To rule out contamination issues, proper negative controls, including no template, no primer; and no enzyme, were always kept alongside each run. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated on 105 clinical samples from individuals having ocular infection. RESULTS: Of the 105 samples tested, 27 were positive for WNV by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative evaluation with conventional RT-PCR revealed 100 per cent accordance with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 per cent, respectively. The specificity of this assay was confirmed with serum samples obtained from patients with dengue and chikungunya. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP test seemed to be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of WNV infection and would be useful for rapid screening of a large number of clinical samples in endemic areas during outbreaks.","output":"Evaluation of real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for clinical diagnosis of West Nile virus in patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing more than 8 million deaths till mid-August, 2020.

We conducted an analysis of national tuberculosis strategic plans, a cross-sectional survey of senior staff of tuberculosis programmes, key informant interviews and some country case studies. FINDINGS: Of the 37 countries and areas of the Western Pacific Region, 14 had a national tuberculosis strategic plan, including all countries and areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis. Most senior tuberculosis programme staff who responded to the survey (16/23) found the regional framework useful when developing their national targets and grant applications. Programmatic challenges identified included financing, human resources, publicCprivate mix, active case finding, and paediatric and drug-resistant tuberculosis. Most of the 17 key informants thought that the regional frameworks categorization of actions (for all settings, for specific settings and for pre-elimination settings) was useful, but that the added value of the regional framework over other relevant documents was not obvious because of overlap in content.

Rheumatology outpatient clinics have mostly become virtual or telephone consultation clinics which prevent medical students from seeing patients in person. Students are deprived of the opportunities to take rheumatology history, examining patients and seeing signs of rheumatologic diseases. New adaptations have to be made to ensure equitability and that students still receive the relevant teaching in line with their learning curriculum and to help them prepare for their examinations. Objectives: Our aims are: 1)To adapt bedside teaching in the wards to simulated teaching in the classroom using trained simulated 'patients';and 2)To create simulation teaching of patient journeys in Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) format known as Clinically Observed Medical Education Tutorials (COMET) (Nair et al., 2001). Methods: 1)For simulated teaching in the classroom, we have trained our teaching colleagues as simulated or standardized patients (SPs). We write up fictitious patient histories which simulate common presentations at rheumatology clinics. We train the SPs to give as accurate a history as possible and to simulate pains in different joints (e.g. pain at the metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints in rheumatoid arthritis) on clinical examinations. For clinical presentations that are not easily simulated, we use photographs of the relevant signs. This method is used not only as formative assessments but also as endof-placement summative assessments. 2)COMET comprises 3 OSCE-style stations with a tutor each where the students perform different tasks based on a patient's clinical problem (e.g. acute hot swollen joint). The first station is initial A-to-E assessment of the patient (using a simulator), followed by investigations and interpretations of lab results and imaging (station 2) and lastly, management (including prescribing medications) and communication skills (e.g. explain arthrocentesis to the patient). Results: The overall feedback from students is very positive. We use Likert scale to assess confidence level before and after the teaching session, and pre-session and post-session multiple choice questions to assess learning and knowledge gained. Conclusion: While simulated teaching cannot replace encounters with real patients, students do enjoy these sessions as they get to 'experience' a large variety of rheumatologic cases and practice their clinical skills which at times are limited with real patients due to reluctance and pain of the patients.","output":"Rheumatology teaching in times of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) created a rush to discover drug candidates.

Our methodology consists of 3 main steps: (1) training and validation of general chemistry-based generative model; (2) fine-tuning of the generative model for the chemical space of SARS-CoV- M(pro) inhibitors and (3) training of a classifier for bioactivity prediction using transfer learning. The fine-tuned chemical model generated > 90% valid, diverse and novel (not present on the training set) structures. The generated molecules showed a good overlap with M(pro) chemical space, displaying similar physicochemical properties and chemical structures. In addition, novel scaffolds were also generated, showing the potential to explore new chemical series.

In the UK, little progress has been made despite the implementation of measures to tackle racialised inequities in the health services. So, what is it about the health service organisational context which shapes and maintains such inequities, and what role does discrimination, bullying and harassment play? Drawing on qualitative interviews with 48 healthcare staff in London (UK), we identify how micro-level bullying, prejudice, discrimination and harassment behaviours, independently and in combination, exploit and maintain meso-level racialised hierarchies. Within teams, the high diversity-low inclusion dynamic shaped and was perpetuated by in- and outgroup inclusion and exclusion processes (including \\"insidious dismissal\\") often employing bullying or microaggressions.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort of arriving international travellers. SETTING: Toronto Pearson Airport Terminal 1, Toronto, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of this study were passengers arriving on international flights. Inclusion criteria were those aged 18 or older who had a final destination within 100 km of the airport, spoke English or French, and provided consent. Excluded were those taking a connecting flight, had no internet access, exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival or were exempted from quarantine.

These vaccinations prevent work-related infections, protect patients and help to maintain the medical infrastructure. Thorough training and imparting of knowledge about vaccinations and work-related infections are essential pillars of the vaccination decision and thus for achieving a protective immune status. The present study examines the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of nursing- and health care students in Hesse regarding work-related infections and vaccinations. Methods: In spring 2018, seven nursing schools in Hesse took part in an anonymous survey study. A total of 690 surveys from students of various health care professions were included in the study. The content of the survey was based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO), a literature review and sample questions from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding vaccine hesitancy. Vaccination cards were also evaluated based on the STIKO recommendations concerning standard vaccinations and occupational vaccinations for health care workers. Results: The risk of acquiring a work-related infection was estimated to be quite high over all years of training. Gaps in knowledge were particularly evident in the area of vaccinations. Only three quarter of those surveyed believed that the effectiveness of vaccinations has been proven, and nearly 30% believed that the doses of the drugs used in vaccines were dangerous. Over 80% of the students had never had an influenza vaccination documented in their vaccination card. Conclusions: The knowledge about vaccinations imparted in the course of the education should be expanded. A special course on the subject of vaccinations and the immune system with practical elements could contribute to a better understanding of how vaccinations work and misunderstandings could be eliminated in early stages of the training through the dialog between the students and the teacher in the classroom and the occupational physician as part of preventive occupational health check-ups.","output":"Knowledge, attitude and behavior towards vaccinations among nursing- and health care students in Hesse.

In parallel to their implementation for fast collection of data to sustain surveillance and mitigation decisions, molecular protocols need to be harmonized to deliver accurate, reproducible, and comparable analytical outputs. Here we studied analytical variabilities linked to viral RNA isolation methods from sewage. Three different influent wastewater volumes were used to assess the effect of filtered volumes (50, 100 or 500 mL) for capturing viral particles. Three different concentration strategies were tested by electronegative membranes, polyethersulfone membranes, and anion-exchange diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. To compare the number of viral particles, different RNA isolation methods (column-based vs. magnetic beads) were compared. The effect of extra RNA purification steps and different RT-qPCR strategies (one step vs. two-step) were also evaluated. Results showed that the combination of 500 mL filtration volume through electronegative membranes and without multiple RNA purification steps (using column-based RNA purification) using two-step RT-qPCR avoided false negatives when basal viral load in sewage are present and yielded more consistent results during the surveillance done during the second-wave in Delft (The Hague area, The Netherlands).

Our results for the first time describe the virus patterning behaviour processes all over the world, giving for them quantitative measures. We know that the outcomes of this work are still partial and more advanced analyses of the virus behaviour in nature are necessary. However, we think that the set of methods implemented can provide significant advantages to better analyse the viral behaviour in the approach of system biology4, thus expanding knowledge and improving pandemic problem solving.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 emerging complexity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When COVID-19 rapidly spread across the globe in 2020, and people were either encouraged or forced to self-isolate and stay at home, for many, the only way to \\"keep in touch\\" with family, friends, peers and colleagues was via virtual environments. The use of digital platforms such as Skype, WhatsApp, Google Meets, Zoom, House Party, and Microsoft Teams, among others, quickly became the only way in which to \\"reach out\\" to others. As the physical boundaries of touch were being redrawn and aggressively (re)policed in public spaces, and, as \\"keeping in contact\\" with loved ones and colleagues was increasingly operationalised through digital technologies, traffic on the digital superhighway increased significantly. Although many people had already travelled on that road in the past, activities usually conducted in face-to-face environments quickly migrated to the digital realm. At the same time, through strategic advertising campaigns, many mobile network companies in South Africa promised that their networks provided opportunities for seamlessly sustaining both leisure and work activities online by using catchphrases that highlighted \\"being together\\" and \\"staying connected\\" while on the Internet. Thus, through strategic marketing strategies, togetherness and connection were quickly presented as the basis of a new form of \\"keeping in touch\\" with others. With reference to theorists on touch and digital communication, as well as visual examples of advertisements, prototypes and artworks, in this article I investigate the following questions that arise from this situation. What forms of touch are afforded by digital communication technologies? How is our embodied experience of sociality being transformed by digital networked communication? To what extent might the digital screen be considered an interface for embodied interaction? In short, this article explores how embodied perception and touch are presented, performed and experienced in remote digital environments, and draws some conclusions about the future of touch in the digital landscape. While it is certainly not a novel observation that digital technologies assist in establishing and maintaining intimate social relationships at a physical distance, it does appear that this situation has been accelerated by the social impact of the pandemic. Carlos Velasco and Marianna Obrist (2020) argue that \\"the pandemic appears to be changing the game entirely\\". While many people had never imagined going online to attend a funeral, a birthday party, an exhibition opening, or to take a game drive, these, and many other social activities, have become part of what is widely being referred to in the media as \\"the new normal\\". Despite the inequalities inherent in the digital communication economy, especially in developing countries such as South Africa, the increased digitisation of human experience and the seamless integration of offl ine and digital worlds into \\"a sort of mixed reality\\" (Velasco & Obrist 2020) appears to have taken place. In her analysis of haptic modes of visuality, Martine Beugnet (2013) calls for an interrogation of what embodied perception means in light of the rise of new technologies. This interrogation is needed at a time when we are experiencing a material and technological crisis of the fl esh and different -- often polarised -- opinions regarding the possibility of embodied experience within the realm of the digital. This is because the digital is often regarded as entirely immaterial (see Coleman 2007). Revisiting embodied perception is thus an important extension of these debates as is the question of whether or not digital communication technologies satisfy our human desire for connection. In this article, therefore, critical theories on digitality are discussed in relation to a selection of advertisements, prototypes, images on social media platforms and artworks to show that, while touch has been actively sought out in digital environments, for many it remains an elusive experience. I begin by exploring the significance and boundaries of touch in soci l ife. I immediately try to put my finger on the significance of touch for being human, and briefl y demonstrate the cultural construction of acceptable (and unacceptable) forms (and sites) of touch. I show that while the boundaries of touch have been strictly redrawn owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our tactile senses have never been free from some or other form of ideological policing. That touch is multiple or \\"manifold,\\" as Mark Paterson (2007:3) puts it, assists in giving shape to the discussions that follow. Thereafter, I refl ect on Edward Casey's (2013) and Sherry Turkle's (2015) ruminations on how technologically mediated conversations impede deep dialogical engagements with others, ultimately leading to an inability, or reduced capacity, for empathy. The work of two South African artists, Jenna Burchell and Magdel Fourie (now Van Rooyen), who have refl ected on this very dilemma powerfully and insightfully illustrate these arguments. Their works hint at the promise, but ultimate failure, of remote digital communication technologies to facilitate a deep or intimate feeling of presence between families or loved ones in online communication. In the next section, I track the history of developments in haptic technologies which have attempted to facilitate the sense of \\"presence\\" or \\"copresence\\" in digital environments. Thereafter, I extend this discussion into the present-day to trace more recent attempts at addressing the lack of touch in digital communication. I discuss the Heartbits app, the Kissenger device and the various prototypes that have emerged from the IN-TOUCH project at University College London (UCL). Finally, I try to grasp what the future of touch might hold in digital environments, based on insights drawn from a recent artwork entitled Towards Telepathy (2017) produced by the South African artist, Katherine Bull and the French artist, Emmanuel de Montbron. These artists explore connection between individuals through the mode of \\"haptic visuality\\" as formulated by Laura Marks (2000).

The use of multivariable prediction models could result in more efficient primary AF screening by selecting at-risk individuals. We aimed to determine which model may be best suitable for increasing efficiency of future primary AF screening efforts. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a systematic review on multivariable models derived, validated, and/or augmented for AF prediction in community cohorts using Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) through 1 August 2019. We performed meta-analysis of model discrimination with the summary C-statistic as the primary expression of associations using a random effects model. In case of high heterogeneity, we calculated a 95% prediction interval. We used the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) checklist for risk of bias assessment. We included 27 studies with a total of 2 978 659 unique participants among 20 cohorts with mean age ranging from 42 to 76 years. We identified 21 risk models used for incident AF risk in community cohorts. Three models showed significant summary discrimination despite high heterogeneity: CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) [summary C-statistic 0.71; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.66-0.76], FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study risk score for AF) (summary C-statistic 0.70; 95% CI 0.64-0.76), and CHA2DS2-VASc (summary C-statistic 0.69; 95% CI 0.64-0.74). Of these, CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF had originally been derived for AF incidence prediction. Only CHARGE-AF, which comprises easily obtainable measurements and medical history elements, showed significant summary discrimination among cohorts that had applied a uniform (5-year) risk prediction window. CONCLUSION CHARGE-AF appeared most suitable for primary screening purposes in terms of performance and applicability in older community cohorts of predominantly European descent.","output":"Prediction models for atrial fibrillation applicable in the community: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide challenge for the medical sector. Healthcare workers (HCW) are a cohort vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact with COVID-19 patients. However, they are also well trained and equipped with protective gear. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status was assessed at three different time points in 450 HCW of the University Hospital Essen in Germany. HCW were stratified according to contact frequencies with COVID-19 patients in (I) a high-risk group with daily contacts with known COVID-19 patients (n = 338), (II) an intermediate-risk group with daily contacts with non-COVID-19 patients (n = 78), and (III) a low-risk group without patient contacts (n = 34). The overall seroprevalence increased from 2.2% in March-May to 4.0% in June-July to 5.1% in October-December. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection rate was not significantly different between the high-risk group (1.8%; 3.8%; 5.5%), the intermediate-risk group (5.1%; 6.3%; 6.1%), and the low-risk group (0%, 0%, 0%). The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence remained low in HCW in western Germany one year after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany, and hygiene standards seemed to be effective in preventing patient-to-staff virus transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Healthcare Workers in Germany: A Follow-Up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses (CoVs) have long been known to cause infection in domestic and free-living birds and mammals including humans. The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the biological properties of CoVs, including ability to cross interspecies barriers, enable its emergence in populations of various animals, including companion animals (cats, dogs, rabbits) an area requiring further study. To date, several cases of cats and dogs positive for SARS-CoV-2 and/or specific antibodies have been described. The aim of our cross-sectional retrospective study is to determine seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic dog, cat and rabbit population during recent COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. RESULTS: In total, serum samples from 279 cats and 343 dogs and 29 rabbits were used in the study. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and dogs reached 1.79% (95% CI: 0.77 C 4.13) and 1.17% (95% CI 0.45 C 2.96), respectively (p  0.05). Anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 5 cats (mean S/P% 106  48.23) and 4 dogs (mean S/P% 78.5  16.58). All 29 samples from rabbits were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. No significant gender or age differences in seroprevalence in dogs and cats (p  0.05) were found. None of the animals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed respiratory or gastrointestinal signs at the time of sampling.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the impact of telehealth on completion of postpartum care goals. STUDY DESIGN: In a single-center retrospective cohort study, we compared a 14-week period, March to June 2019, before implementation of telehealth, with the same calendar months after implementation during 2020. Patients with a postpartum visit scheduled at our institution during the study period were included. To demonstrate a 10% difference in attendance to the postpartum visit in the postimplementation compared with the preimplementation group, a power analysis calculation resulted in a requirement of at least 356 subjects per group. Our primary outcome was attendance to the postpartum visit. Secondary outcomes included completion of postpartum depression screening, contraception selection, breastfeeding status at postpartum visit, completion of 2-hour glucose tolerance test postpartum for those with gestational diabetes mellitus, and cardiology follow-up when recommended. Multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 1579 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 780 were in the preimplementation group and 799 in the postimplementation group. Subjects in the postimplementation group were at 90% increased odds of attending a postpartum visit compared with those in the preimplementation group, even when controlling for race, prenatal care provider, parity, gestational age at delivery, and insurance status (82.9% vs 72.4%; P<.001; adjusted odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-2.46). Patients in the postimplementation group were also more likely to be screened for postpartum depression (86.3% vs 65.1%; P<.001). Although subjects in both groups were equally likely to choose contraception, those in the postimplementation group were less likely to select long-acting reversible contraception or permanent sterilization (26.2% vs 33.2%; P=.03). There was no significant difference in breastfeeding status, postpartum 2-hour glucose tolerance test completion, or cardiology follow-up between groups. CONCLUSION: Availability of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased postpartum visit attendance and postpartum depression screening. However, telehealth was also associated with a decrease in use of long-acting reversible contraception or permanent sterilization.","output":"The impact on postpartum care by telehealth: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and resistant Escherichia coli (rE.coli) infections can spread rapidly. Further they are associated with high morbidity and mortality from treatment failure. Therapy involves multiple rounds of ineffective antibiotics alongside unwanted side effects, alternative treatments are crucial. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a natural, vegan product that has been shown to have powerful antimicrobial activity hence we investigated whether ACV could ameliorate these resistant bacteria. The minimum dilution of ACV required for growth inhibition was comparable for both bacteria (1/25 dilution of ACV liquid and ACV tablets at 200 g/ml were effective against rE. coli and MRSA). Monocyte co-culture with microbes alongside ACV resulted in an increase in monocyte phagocytosis by 21.2% and 33.5% compared to non-ACV treated but MRSA or rE. coli stimulated monocytes, respectively. Label free quantitative proteomic studies of microbial protein extracts demonstrated that ACV penetrated microbial cell membranes and organelles, altering the expression of key proteins. This resulted in significant reductions in total protein expression, moreover we could only detect ribosomal proteins; 50 s 30 s, enolase, phosphenol pyruvate and the ATP synthase subunit in rE. coli.

In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people. The patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age (mean age 38.5 years); 38.7% were men. The overall case fatality in the SARS outbreak was 11.7% (13/111). The outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified. SARS is a highly contagious condition associated with substantial case fatality; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period.

Study data were from both the California and Los Angeles Departments of Public Health and as well as news organizations on nursing homes reporting COVID-19 infections between March and May 4, 2020. Results indicate that nursing homes with total RN staffing levels under the recommended minimum standard (0.75 hours per resident day) had a two times greater probability of having COVID-19 resident infections. Nursing homes with lower Medicare five-star ratings on total nurse and RN staffing levels (adjusted for acuity), higher total health deficiencies, and more beds had a higher probability of having COVID-19 residents. Nursing homes with low RN and total staffing levels appear to leave residents vulnerable to COVID-19 infections.

Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire about the acute illness and pre-specified neurological, dermatological, sensory, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, mental health (including emotional and behavioural well-being) and other symptoms experienced at least five times at one month after the PCR test. RESULTS: Overall, 35.0% (859/2456) completed the questionnaire, including 38.0% (472/1242) cases and 32% (387/1214) controls. of whom 68% (320/472) and 40% (154/387) were symptomatic, respectively.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database was performed, including patients with VM of the head and neck who were treated with PS. Only patients with available pre- and post-interventional MRI were included into this study. Clinical outcome, which was subjectively assessed by the patients, their parents (for paediatric patients) and/or the physicians, was categorized as worse, unchanged, minor or major improvement. Radiological outcome, determined by MRI-based volumetric measurements, was categorized as worse (>10% increase), unchanged (10% increase to <10% decrease), minor (10% to <25% decrease), intermediate (25% to <50% decrease) or major improvement (50% decrease). RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were treated in 51 treatment sessions. After a mean follow-up of 31 months, clinical outcome was worse for 7.4%, unchanged for 3.7% of the patients, while there was minor and major improvement for 7.4% and 81.5%, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, nasopharyngeal swab sample was obtained from 1 326 patients who presented to Ege University, Medical Faculty Children's Hospital between 2002 and 2012 and who were thought to have respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus type A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus type 1-3 were investigated using shell-vial cell culture method and direct fluorescent antibody test and/or multiplex PCR test. Parainfluenza virus type 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, human bocavirus were investigated using multiplex PCR test. The seasonal distributions of the viruses were determined according to the results obtained from Ege University Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Microbiology Clinical Virology Laboratory. Approval was obtained from the ethics committee (Ege University Clinical Researches Ethics Committee, 12.02.2013, number: 13-1/46). RESULTS The majority of the patients who presented were outpatients (n:888, 67%) and the remainder were hospitalized patients (33%, n:438).

METHODS: Out of 7328 eligible individuals, the population-based cross-sectional Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5899 (80.5%) individuals aged 40+ years, who underwent a detailed medical and ophthalmological examination. Using ocular fundus photographs and optical coherence tomographic images, we assessed prevalence and degree of DR in 5105 participants. RESULTS: DR was present in 99/5105 individuals (1.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6, 2.3). Its prevalence increased from 6/657 (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.6) in the age group of 45C50 years to 24/680 (3.5%; 95% CI: 2.1, 4.9) in the age group of 65C70 years, and decreased to 3/153 (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.00, 4.2) in the age group of 80+ years. DR prevalence within the 577 (11.4%; 95% CI: 10.5, 12.2) individuals with diabetes was 99/577 (17.2%; 95% CI: 14.1, 20.2). DR was the cause for moderate-to-severe vision impairment (best corrected visual acuity <6/18 but 3/60) in four individuals (4/5105; 0.07%). In multivariable analysis, higher DR prevalence was associated with higher serum glucose concentration (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.20, 141), longer diabetes duration (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.09), type of diabetes therapy (nil/diet/oral/insulin) (OR:4.19;95% CI:3.08, 5.70), lower educational level (OR:0.81;95% CI:0.67, 0.98), lower manual dynamometric force (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99), shorter ocular axial length (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.96), and higher diastolic blood pressure (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06), or alternatively, higher estimated cerebrospinal fluid pressure (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.18). CONCLUSION: In this urban and rural Russian population aged 40+ years, DR prevalence was relatively low (1.9%; 95% CI: 1.6, 2.3), showed an inverted U-shaped association with age, and in a cross-sectional study design it was associated with shorter axial length and higher estimated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.","output":"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Diabetic Retinopathy in a Russian Population.

This study aimed to investigate the value of chest CT radiomics for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia compared with clinical model and COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS), and develop an open-source diagnostic tool with the constructed radiomics model. Methods This study enrolled 115 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 435 non-COVID-19 pneunomia patients (training dataset, n = 379;validation dataset, n = 131;testing dataset, n = 40). Key radiomics features extracted from chest CT images were selected to build a radiomics signature using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Clinical and clinico-radiomics combined models were constructed. The combined model was further validated in the viral pneumonia cohort, and compared with performance of two radiologists with CO-RADS. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results Eight radiomics features and 5 clinical variables were selected to construct the combined radiomics model, which outperformed the clinical model in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.98 and good calibration in the validation cohort. The combined model also performed better in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia with an AUC of 0.93 compared with 0.75 ( P = 0.03) for clinical model, and 0.69 ( P = 0.008) or 0.82 ( P = 0.15) for two trained radiologists using CO-RADS. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model can be achieved to 0.85 and 0.90. The DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the combined model. An easy-to-use open-source diagnostic tool was developed using the combined model. Conclusions The combined radiomics model outperformed clinical model and CO-RADS for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia, which can facilitate more rapid and accurate detection.","output":"CT radiomics facilitates more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia: compared with CO-RADS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Newcastle disease virus (NDV) with high pathogenicity has frequently been isolated in poultry in China since 1948, the mode of its transmission among avian species remains largely unknown. Given that various wild bird species have been implicated as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks, and pigeons in live bird markets (LBMs) in South China as part of an H7N9 surveillance program during December 2013CFebruary 2014. To simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVsnamely, GM, YF18, and GZ289isolated from different birds to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 10(6) EID(50) of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour after infection, the na?ve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China's Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virusChost relationship.","output":"Phylogenetic and Pathotypic Characterization of Newcastle Disease Viruses Circulating in South China and Transmission in Different Birds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can transport various cargoes through membranes of live cells. Since the first generations of CPPs suffered from insufficient cell and tissue selectivity, stability against proteases, and escape from endosomes, a new generation of peptides, with optimized properties, was developed. These are either derived from natural sources or created through the combination of multivalent structures. The second method allows achieving high internalization efficiency, high cell and tissue selectivity, and release from endosomes via hybrid structures, combining sequences for endosomal release, homing sequences, and sequences for activation at the target tissue and for local delivery of cargoes. CPPs with innate tumor selectivity include azurin, crotamine, maurocalcine, lycosin-I, buffalo cathelicidin, and peptide CB5005. Some of them can penetrate the membranes of live cells and influence intracellular signaling pathways, thereby exerting cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. To obtain multilayer penetration and stabilization against proteolytic degradation, as well as for better handling, CPPs are often conjugated to nanoparticles. A special problem for tumor treatment is the efficiency of drug transport through three-dimensional cell cultures. Therefore, the capability of CPPs to deliver the drug even to the innermost tissues is of crucial importance. Notably, the ability of certain CPPs to penetrate barriers such as skin, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and cornea or conjunctiva of eyes enabled the replacement of dangerous and painful injections with soothing sprays, creams, and drops. However, it is difficult to rank the efficacy of CPPs because transport efficiency and tissue selectivity depend not only on the CPP itself but also on the target tissue or organ, as well as on the cargo and method of CPP-cargo coupling. Therefore, the present review describes some examples of new-generation CPPs and aims to provide advice on how to find or create the right CPP for a given task.","output":"New generation of cell-penetrating peptides: Functionality and potential clinical application."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant viruses constitute a large group of pathogens causing damaging diseases in many agricultural and horticultural crops around the world [...].","output":"Genomics in Plant Viral Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global Covid-19 outbreak has disrupted schooling worldwide.

We evaluated the technical aspects and outcome of a standardized approach in a single centre and examined the feasibility of including this into training curricula. METHOD The procedure entails a laparoscopy for adhesiolysis and identification and mobilization of the rectal stump. Mobilization of the splenic flexure is performed if necessary, and a colorectal anastomosis is fashioned after introduction of the stapler anvil via the colostomy with intra-abdominal positioning and delivery into the proximal colonic segment to be anastomosed. The stoma is excised as the last step in the operation. RESULTS Forty-two patients underwent the procedure over an 8-year period with either an expert (n=21) or trainee under expert mentorship (n=21) as first operator. Intra-operative data and postoperative outcomes were evaluated by retrospective review of clinical charts and theatre records. There was a 9.5% conversion rate and 0% mortality. One patient suffered a ureteric injury, while postoperative surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (including one clinical anastomotic leakage). The mean operative time was 117 min. There was no significant difference in intra operative technical parameters or postoperative clinical consequences between procedures performed by a trained surgeon or by a trainee under mentorship. CONCLUSION Adherence to a standardized operative protocol and expert mentorship allows this technically demanding operation to be associated with low conversion and complication rates. The absence of any difference between procedures performed by a trainee or trained surgeon suggests that the operation can be included in training programmes for laparoscopic surgery.","output":"Technical aspects and outcome of a standardized full laparoscopic approach to the reversal of Hartmann's procedure in a teaching centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemotherapy is the most common clinical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but low efficiency and high toxicity of current chemotherapy drugs limit their clinical application.

Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841 employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020, who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD = 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120), living in the 10 hospitals' service areas.

Methods: A total of 36 patients (20 males, 16 females, aged from 14 to 74 years old) who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from November 2018 to April 2019 were enrolled into the retrospective study, including 11 cases of ECRSwNP, 15 cases of non-ECRSwNP and 10 cases in control group (deviation of nasal septum). The patients were divided into allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis groups, atopy and non-atopy groups according to whether patients in the experimental group and control group had allergic rhinitis and atopy. HE staining was performed for histological assessment of CRSwNP which was classfied as ECRSwNP and non-ECRSwNP. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the positive localization and semi-quantitative expression level of galectin-10 protein in ERSwNP, non-ECRSwNP and control groups. The expression levels of galectin-10 protein in three groups were determined by Western Blot.

We successfully isolated a novel respirovirus from the lungs of a dead Malayan pangolin. Similar to murine respirovirus, the full-length genome of this novel virus was 15a384 nucleotides comprising six genes in the order 3'-(leader)-NP-P-M-F-HN-l-(trailer)-5'. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus belongs to the genus Respirovirus and is most closely related to murine respirovirus. Notably, animal infection experiments indicated that the pangolin virus is highly pathogenic and transmissible in mice, with inoculated mice having variable clinical symptoms and a fatality rate of 70.37a%. The virus was found to replicate in most tissues with the exception of muscle and heart. Contact transmission of the virus was 100a% efficient, although the mice in the contact group displayed milder symptoms, with the virus mainly being detected in the trachea and lungs. The isolation of a novel respirovirus from the Malayan pangolin provides new insight into the evolution and distribution of this important group of viruses and again demonstrates the potential infectious disease threats faced by endangered pangolins.","output":"Pathogenicity and transmissibility of a novel respirovirus isolated from a Malayan pangolin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper analyses the impact of the control measures during the COVID-19 lockdown in Europe (15 MarchC30 April 2020) on 1-h daily maximum nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and maximum daily 8-h running average ozone (MDA8 O3) observations obtained from the European Environment Agency's air quality database (AirBase). Daily maximum NO2 decreased consistently over the whole continent, with relative reductions ranging from 5% to 55% with respect to the same period in 2015C2019 for 80% of the sites considered (10th C 90th percentiles). However, MDA8 O3 concentrations showed a different pattern, decreasing over Iberia and increasing elsewhere. In particular, a large region from northwestern to central Europe experienced increases of 10C22% at urban background stations, reaching typical values of the summer season. The analysis of the expected NO2 and O3 concentrations in the absence of the lockdown, using generalised additive models fed by reanalysis meteorological data, shows that the low NO2 concentrations were mostly attributed to the emission reductions while O3 anomalies were dominated by the meteorology. The relevance of each meteorological variable depends on the location. The positive O3 anomalies in northwestern and central Europe were mostly associated with elevated temperatures, low specific humidity and enhanced solar radiation. This pattern could be an analogue to study the limits of pollution control policies under climate change scenarios. On the other hand, the O3 reduction in Iberia is mostly attributable to the low solar radiation and high specific humidity, although the reduced zonal wind also played a role in the proximity of the Iberian Mediterranean coast.","output":"Early spring near-surface ozone in Europe during the COVID-19 shutdown: Meteorological effects outweigh emission changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The fourth sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, COVID-19, emerged in late 2019, leading to the most devastating pandemic since the Spanish influenza (H1N1) of 1918, which seized 50 million lives worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html). Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD: The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS: Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies.

Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) with COVID\\\\19 have different clinical characteristics and prognostic outcomes. This study aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators of patients with COVID\\\\19 with CVD, especially the critically ill patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 244 patients diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 and CVD (hypertension, coronary heart disease, or heart failure). The patients were categorized into critical (n=36) and noncritical (n=208) groups according to the interim guidance of Chinas National Health Commission. Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from the patients medical records and compared between the 2 groups. The average body mass index of patients was significantly higher in the critical group than in the noncritical group. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and C\\\\reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen, and d\\\\dimer levels at admission were significantly increased in the critical group. The all\\\\cause mortality rate among cases of COVID\\\\19 combined with CVD was 19.26%; the proportion of coronary heart disease and heart failure was significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. High body mass index, previous history of coronary heart disease, lactic acid accumulation, and a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen were associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: All\\\\cause mortality in patients with COVID\\\\19 with CVD in hospitals is high. The high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio may be a predictor of critical patients.

Concerns regarding myocarditis and the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death in athletes have prompted heightened attention to the role of cardiovascular screening. In this review, we aim to comprehensively outline the cardiovascular manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection, to discuss screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, and to evaluate the current literature on the risk to athletes and recommendations regarding return-to-play. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 is known to cause myocarditis, with presentations ranging from subclinical current or prior infection detected on cardiac MRI imaging, to fulminant heart failure and shock. While initial data early in the pandemic suggested that the risk of myocarditis could be significant even in patients with nonsevere COVID-19 infection, recent studies suggest a very low prevalence of clinically significant disease in young athletes. SUMMARY: While COVID-19 can have significant cardiovascular manifestations, recent data demonstrate that a screening approach guided by severity of COVID-19 infection and cardiovascular symptoms allows the majority of athletes to safely return to play in a timely manner. We must continue to tailor our approach to screening athletes as knowledge grows, and further research on the longitudinal cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 is needed.","output":"COVID-19: the Risk to Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of opioid drugs and related overdose deaths, which rose to epidemic proportions over the past decade, have been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, a time of great uncertainty and isolation.

It considers the responses of 149 lesbian/gay women (137 cisgender, 12 trans) to questions relating to physical and mental health and wellbeing. Findings indicate that those women - in couples and singles - who were happy with their living circumstances pre-COVID showed stoicism, adaptability, and determined positivity in response to the pandemic and associated lockdown. Some even reported an improved quality of life, better personal relationships and increased neighborly support. By contrast, those women who were very unhappy with their circumstances prior to COVID-19 - generally women who lived alone and experienced a mismatch between their actual and desired social network - either remained unhappy or became more unhappy, due to its impact on fragile support systems. For trans women, formal support from trans/LGBT+ specific networks - online during COVID lockdown - were central to their wellbeing. Having access to, and being able to use, online technologies were essential to good mental health during lockdown. These findings reaffirm the diversity among older lesbians/gay women as well as highlighting how COVID-19 has acted as a magnifier to their preexisting circumstances.

RESULTS: Pharmacists are specifically identified as mandatory reporters of intimate partner violence in 10 states, of child abuse in 11, and of elder abuse in 20. They may also have reporting requirements in more states as statutes sometimes identify health care providers as mandatory reporters, but do not specify which types of providers. Additionally, many states require reporting of child and elder abuse by anyone who is aware of or suspects abuse.

However, evidence for negative mental and physiological health consequences of such measures for schoolchildren is increasing, highlighting the need for evidence-based recommendations on how to safely reopen schools. This study aims to assess implementation experiences, acceptability and feasibility of opt-in, at-home SARS-CoV-2 screening using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to facilitate safe face-to-face teaching during a pandemic. METHODS: We present data from a prospective study implementing an RDT-based screening programme at a primary school in southwest Germany. In addition to quantitative data collected to assess screening diagnostic yield (number of participants, tests handed out to participants, positive RDT results reported), we conducted qualitative in-depth interviews with participating pupils, parents and school stakeholders to elicit implementation experiences and screening perceptions. RESULTS: The screening intervention was highly accepted and appreciated among participants; no screening-associated positive RDT was reported over the duration of the study. Self-testing at home before coming to school was feasible, but more positive consequences of screening participation (eg, easing of mask mandates) besides a personal feeling of safety would have been appreciated across respondent groups. Participants preferred home-based RDTs over some other measures, particularly mask mandates. Despite the RDTs being licensed as self-tests in Germany, additional training can help avoid mistakes, and ensuring intervention ownership and improving pre-implementation communication can facilitate buy-in.

The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research, assembled experts from the health systems research, regulatory science, data science, and epidemiology to participate in a large parallel analysis of different data sets to further explore the effectiveness of these treatments. METHODS: Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data were extracted from seven separate databases. Parallel analyses were undertaken on data extracted from each source. Each analysis examined time to mortality in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the two in combination as compared to patients not treated with either drug. Cox proportional hazards models were used, and propensity score methods were undertaken to adjust for confounding. Frequencies of adverse events in each treatment group were also examined. RESULTS: Neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with time to mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Paper screening and systematic data extraction was conducted with descriptive statistics and regression analyses calculated from the coded data. Outcome measures were journal characteristics, the extent to which published articles met sex/gender reporting guidelines, plus author gender and location of their affiliated institution. RESULTS: Five of the fourteen journals explicitly encourage sex/gender analysis in their author instructions, but this did not lead to increased sex/gender reporting beyond the gender of study participants (OR=3.69; p=0.000 (CI 1.79 to 7.60)).

First and last authors from high-income countries (HICs) were 19 times as prevalent as authors from low-income countries; and women from low-income and middle-income countries were at a disadvantage in terms of the impact factor of the journals they published in. CONCLUSION: Global health and medical research fails to consistently apply a sex/gender lens and remains largely the preserve of authors in HIC.

In the present work, two quinoa genotypes (Titicaca and Giza1) were treated with different SA concentrations (0, 0.75, and 1.5 mM) under varied irrigation water salinities (0, 7, 14, and 21 dS m(?1)). Salinity decreased shoot and root growth, potassium (K(+)) concentration, and potassium to sodium ratio (K/Na) and increased sodium (Na(+)) and chlorine (Cl(?)) concentrations in both cultivars. Calcium (Ca(2+)) and magnesium (Mg(2+)) concentrations increased in 7 dS m(?1) but decreased in higher salinities. The growth and salinity tolerance of Giza1 were higher, while the growth of Giza1 increased and of Titicaca decreased in high salinity. Salicylic acid at 0.75-mM concentration increased shoot and root growth and improved the ions concentration in favor of the plant, while the 1.5-mM concentration either had no significant effect or had a negative impact. The ions distribution estimated by K/Na selectivity and storage factor (SF) indicated quinoa accumulated more ions in roots under saline conditions. Salicylic acid increased NaSF, ClSF, and MgSF and decreased KSF and CaSF, meaning less Na(+), Cl(?), and Mg(2+) and more K(+) and Ca(2+) transferred to shoots in SA-treated plants. Importantly, Giza1, as the more tolerant cultivar, had higher NaSF and ClSF and lower KSF, CaSF, and MgSF. In general, the concentrations of ions in roots were higher than in shoots. The results indicated more ions accumulation in the root could be one of the most important mechanisms of salinity tolerance in quinoa, and the more tolerant cultivar (Giza1) transferred less Na(+) and Cl(?) and more K(+) and Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) to the shoot.","output":"Salicylic Acid Manipulates Ion Accumulation and Distribution in Favor of Salinity Tolerance in Chenopodium quinoa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the COVID-19 era, physical interactions ubiquitously pose a disease threat. Using a novel online paradigm, this study tested whether under such unique circumstances, the fundamental motivation to avoid disease-related threats interacts with individual differences in sociability, such that: (i) responses to others are slowed down, particularly among sociable individuals, reflecting motivational tension; (ii) the role of sociability in predicting interaction likelihood is diminished. Participants (Israeli young adults, N = 207) listened to auditory descriptions of everyday social situations, taking place in either the physical or virtual space, and decided quickly whether to interact. Participants also completed the Sociability Scale (Cheek & Buss, 1981). Responses were slower in the physical compared to virtual space, regardless of sociability. The association between interaction likelihood and sociability was stronger in the virtual space, with sociability mirrored by self-reported fear of COVID-19 in predicting interaction likelihood. We propose that when physical contact with others poses a threat to safety, fear supersedes sociability in guiding behavior in physical interactions.","output":"Fear of being near: Fear supersedes sociability when interacting amid a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantially elevated distress in pregnant individuals, which has the potential to impact the developing infant brain. Our main objective was to understand how prenatal distress was related to infant brain structure and function, and whether social support moderated the associations. METHODS: This Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic cohort study collected Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System anxiety, Edinburgh Depression Scale, and Social Support Effectiveness Questionnaire from a population-based sample of pregnant individuals living in Canada (N=8602). For a sub-sample of participants, their infants (N=75) underwent MRI at 3-months of age to examine whether prenatal maternal distress was associated with infant brain architecture, including the role of social support as a potential protective factor. RESULTS: 33.4% participants demonstrating clinically elevated depression symptoms and 47.1% of participants demonstrating clinically elevated anxiety symptoms. Importantly, we identified lower social support significantly predicts clinically elevated prenatal maternal distress (T=-22.3, p<0.001). After image quality control, we retained 63 image datasets (40M/23F, 92+/-14 days old). We found significant relationships between prenatal maternal distress and infant amygdala-prefrontal microstructural and functional connectivity measures, and demonstrate for the first time that social support moderates these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a potentially long-lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and show that social support acts as a possible mediator not just for pregnant individuals, but also developing infants. These findings provide timely evidence to inform clinical practice and policy surrounding the care of pregnant individuals and highlight the importance of social support.","output":"Prenatal maternal distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and associations with infant brain connectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, the lockdown, isolation, and quarantine restrictions which were put in place in many countries obliged many people to begin working from home.

The GCC countries rely on imports for a large portion of food due to environmental conditions that restrict agricultural development. Covid-19 is increasing concerns of food crisis in these countries, limiting the movement of logistics and personnel. GCC countries are pushing for policies such as expanding domestic production, increasing investment in overseas farmland and food sectors, and diversifying sources of income, which are expected to be pursued more actively in the future. Meanwhile, the introduction of technology-based smart agriculture in GCC is expected to accelerate as agricultural innovation incorporating high-tech technologies, or AgTech, has emerged as a global issue in the agricultural sector amid the ongoing fourth industrial revolution and technological innovation. This study aims to explore the current status and characteristics of food security in the GCC countries, analyze policies, and derive cooperative implications in response to the GCCa?s reinforcement of food security to provide a way to diversify Koreaa?s energy and construction-focused cooperation with the GCC region.Chapter 2 nalyzes the GCCa?s food security situation through the World Food Security Index and statistics related to food production and supply. GCC countries ranked 13th to 50th out of 113 countries in the 2019 World Food Security Index. Among the sub-sectors, particularly high scores and rankings were given to a?affordability,a? which is relevant to the countrya?s wealth and food purchasing capacity. GCC countries remained at the bottom of the world in terms of natural resources and resilience, a sector which is not included in the index calculation but can gauge the likelihood of future food crises due to environmental changes. Meanwhile, food production in GCC countries accounted for only 25.2 percent of total consumption. Most of the food production shortfalls were supplied through imports, especially, the proportion of imports to total consumption of grains was 93.0%. The stock of grain is also low compared to consumption. In other words, it appears GCC countries are maintaining good food security levels overall, but they will face limitations that are difficult to cope with when food supply problems arise due to their high dependence on food imports and lack of water and farmland.Chapter 3 examines the GCCa?s food security policies and the direction of change in the post-Covid-19 era. Since the 2008 global food crisis, the GCC has been pushing for policies to strengthen food security by increasing domestic food production and increasing overseas investment. These initiatives in GCC countries are accelerating further with the Covid-19 pandemic. In announcing their national development plans, the GCC countries selected food security as one of the key areas, going on to develop detailed strategies and establish dedicated organizations. Moreover, the government is promoting sustainable agriculture that considers the environment and introducing smart agriculture projects, and is expanding corporate support and research and development around the UAE. GCC countries are also expanding investment in overseas farmland and international food companies and strengthening food stockpiles and supply and demand management.Chapter 4 touched upon cases of cooperation between major countries such as China, Japan, the United States, and Europe and the GCC. In addition to government-level cooperation, China is actively engaged in private and academic cooperation. Agreements have been reached between the Chinese and UAE governments on strengthening cooperation in the agricultural sector and developing technologies, and various related projects are underway. While Japan is also establishing a cooperative system at the government level, the creation of funds through public-private funds is a notable feature. Japan, in cooperation with the GCC sovereign wealth fund, is investing in joint ventures established bilaterally with local companies. Technology-based startups in the U.S. and Europe are actively entering the GCC market. The UAE is attracting and investing agricultural start-ups in these countries.Chapter 5 explores the current status of cooperation between Korea and the GCC region and seeks future cooperation directions. First, it will be able to strengthen intergovernmental agricultural technology cooperation and corporate support policies. At the government level, expanding cooperation in agricultural technology and carrying out joint projects will be able to facilitate entry of companies. As demand for smart farms in the GCC region increases, it is expected that introduction of smart agriculture systems will expand. While leading agricultural countries such as the Netherlands, Europe, and the U.S. are actively pushing for entry into the GCC region, it will be necessary to come up with strategies to find sectors that are differentiated from these companies and in which Korea can show competitiveness. In addition, cooperation related to farm labor education can take place as the GCC local agricultural sector is assessed to lack manpower capabilities. In this regard, the government will be able to provide educat on through the operation of human resources exchange programs and promote knowledge sharing projects through the dispatch of agricultural experts. In addition, these efforts will allow the government and companies to diversify entry areas according to changes in food value chain. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, there have been changes in the GCC local food market, such as an increase in online orders and demand for healthy foods. As a result, the importance of cold chains is expected to increase, and consumption of organic products, halal foods, and stored foods will continue to increase. Finally, the creation of an industrial cluster exclusively for Korea could be promoted in the food sector. The food industry cluster will be able to promote shared growth by providing incentives to agricultural and food companies and increasing synergy through corporate integration.","output":"Food Security Policies of GCC Countries and Their Implications for Korea in the Post-Covid-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide a first view of vulnerable informal economy after the blows from COVID-19, using transaction-level business data of around 80 million offline micro businesses (OMBs) owners from the largest Fintech company in China and employing machine learning method for causal inference.

Methods: : The Sichuan Suining Central Hospital received 11 patients with confirmed nCoV virus infection from 4 families during January 23 rd , 2020 to February 20 th , 2020. Their clinical symptoms, treatment conditions and changes of disease state were reviewed in the present study. Results: In all 4 families, there were 1-2 members in each family who had contact with epidemic disease. Clinical manifestations were: 3 cases had debilitation only, 1 case had cough only, 1 case had diarrhea (a child patient of four years old), 5 cases had fever and cough, and 1 case had blood-stained sputum. According to image changes, no image change was observed in 1 child patient. Multiple focal ground-glass opacities were detected from 2 patients and multiple patchy shadows were observed from 8 patients, especially in lung periphery. Complications with basic diseases: there were hypertension in 3 cases, diabetes in 2 cases, and hypertension and diabetes in 1 case. Moreover, theres one patient who had rheumatic heart disease and received mitral and aortic valve replacement 2 years ago. Theres another one who had depression and suicidal tendency. All 11 cases divided into mild type (1 child patient), moderate type (8 patients), severe type (1 patient) and critical type (1 patient). Treatment: the mild child patient (4 years old) was administrated with 2.75ml lopinavir / ritonavir oral liquid (twice per day) and intravenous drip of 0.17g ribavirin injection (1ml: 0.1g*10pcs/box) every 12h for one week. Meanwhile, the child was asked to take azithromycin orally. 7 moderate patients were treated with intravenous drip of 0.5g ribavirin injection (1ml: 0.1g*10pcs/box) every 12h (twice per day) and two pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior (twice per day) for 7-10 days. In the same time, patients were given with reasonable amount of antibiotics by oral or intravenous drip. 1 severe patient and 1 critical patent were treated with 5,000,000 U recombinant human interferon 2b injection (3,000,000 U/pc) and aerosol inhalation of 2ml sterile water for injection (5ml*50 pcs/ box), twice per day. Besides, they took 2 pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior, twice per day. The whole treatment program lasted for 6-12 days, accompanied with appropriate amount of intravenous drip of antibiotics. The critical patient was also provided with mechanical ventilation. During the treatment, severe and critical patients were treated by resochin for 4-5 days for evident respiratory symptoms. One moderate patient was treated with 2 pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior, twice per day. In the same time, it was administrated by intravenous drip of antibiotics. However, resochin treatment was applied for positive novel coronavirus nucleic acid of respiratory sputum specimen after 11 days of treatment. Discharge: After treatment, patients with body temperatures of all patients recovered to normal level, and respiratory symptoms and digestive tract symptoms relieved significantly, significant coefficient of exudative lesion at lung according to chest CT and negative novel coronavirus nucleic acid of continuous two respiratory sputum specimens (sampling interval was at least 1 day) were allowed to be discharged. Adverse reactions: 4 patients had loose stools and abdominal discomfort, and another 2 cases had diarrhea. Conclusions: : SARS-CoV-2 infection have complicated and diversified symptoms, which shall be identified according to epidemic history and novel coronavirus nucleic acid test. In particular, the whole family in which theres a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 shall be isolated for screening in addition to the patient.

This study investigated the mechanism by which these cytokines act to impede RV. Although IL-18 and IL-22 induce each other's expression, we found that IL-18 and IL-22 both impeded RV independently of one another and did so by distinct mechanisms that involved activation of their cognate receptors in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). IL-22 drove IEC proliferation and migration toward villus tips, which resulted in increased extrusion of highly differentiated IEC that serve as the site of RV replication. In contrast, IL-18 induced cell death of RV-infected IEC thus directly interrupting the RV replication cycle, resulting in spewing of incompetent virus into the intestinal lumen and causing a rapid drop in the number of RV-infected IEC. Together, these actions resulted in rapid and complete expulsion of RV, even in hosts with severely compromised immune systems. These results suggest that a cocktail of IL-18 and IL-22 might be a means of treating viral infections that preferentially target short-lived epithelial cells.","output":"IL-22-induced cell extrusion and IL-18-induced cell death prevent and cure rotavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During COVID-19, Harvard Medical School pivoted to online learning.

The results revealed that the duplex-RT-PCR is a quick and sensitive procedure for simultaneously detecting IBV and NDV in birds with respiratory infections.","output":"Molecular detection of infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease viruses in broiler chickens with respiratory signs using Duplex RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-Cov-2 infection, a pandemic disease since March 2020, is associated with a high percentage of cardiovascular complications mainly of a thromboembolic (TE) nature. Although clinical patterns have been described for the assessment of patients with increased risk, many TE complications occur in patients with apparently moderate risk. Notably, a recent statement from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) atherosclerosis and vascular biology working group pointed out the key role of vascular endothelium for the recruitment of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways responsible for both disseminated intravascular coagulation and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathophysiological process linking infection to increased TE risk is needed in order to understand the pathways of this dangerous liaison and possibly interrupt it with appropriate treatment. In this review, we describe the histological lesions and the related blood coagulation mechanisms involved in COVID-19, we define the laboratory parameters and clinical risk factors associated with TE events, and propose a prophylactic anticoagulation treatment in relation to the risk category. Finally, we highlight the concept that a solid risk assessment based on prospective multi-center data would be the challenge for a more precise risk stratification and more appropriate treatment.","output":"Thromboembolic Complications in Covid-19: From Clinical Scenario to Laboratory Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rates in the countries of the West exceed those in the countries of the East by factors ranging from 10C1 to 100C1. In this paper, we refer to the West as represented by United States plus the five most populous countries of Western Europe, and the East as the 15 countries of East Asia and Oceania that are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This paper argues that the currently available information points to the factors most responsible for this divide. Warnings by early January 2020 about an atypical viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, prompted rapid responses in many jurisdictions in East Asia. Publication of the viruss genome on 10 January 2020 provided essential information for making diagnostic tests and launching vaccine development. Chinas lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January 2020 provided a final, decisive signal of the danger of the new disease. By late March 2020, China had fully controlled its epidemic, and many other RCEP countries had taken early and decisive measures that aborted serious outcomes. Delayed and halting responses in the United States and most other Western countries allowed the disease to take hold and spread. In both the East and the West, stringent population-wide non-pharmaceutical interventions were widely implemented at great cost to societies, economies, and school systems. Without these measures, the outcomes could have been even worse. Most countries in the East also implemented tightly focused policies to isolate infectious individuals. Even today, most countries in the West allow infectious individuals to mingle with their families, coworkers, and communities. Much of the EastCWest divide plausibly results from failure in the West to implement the basic public health policies of early action and the isolation of infectious individuals. Widespread immunization in high-income countries will soon attenuate their outbreaks, while the slow rollout of vaccines in lower income countries is replacing the EastCWest divide in outcomes with a NorthCSouth one. The South will then replace the West as the breeding ground for more contagious or pathogenic variants of the virus.","output":"The EastCWest Divide in Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Definite cure remains exceptional in myeloma patients even after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with melphalan (Mel) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

Approach: To help health-care workers prioritize treatment for patients with more severe disease and to decrease the burden on health systems caused by COVID-19, the government established a system to classify disease severity. Health-care staff in city- and provincial-level patient management teams classified the patients into the different categories according to the patients' pulse, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature and level of consciousness. Patients categorized as having moderate, severe and very severe disease were promptly assigned to beds or negative-pressure isolation rooms for hospital treatment, while patients with mild symptoms were monitored in 16 designated facilities across the country. Local setting: The case fatality rate was higher in the city of Daegu and the Gyeongsangbuk-do province (1.6%; 124/7756) than the rest of the country (0.5%; 7/1485). Relevant changes: From 25 February to 26 March 2020, the ratio of negative-pressure isolation rooms per COVID-19 patient was below 0.15 in the city of Daegu and the Gyeongsangbuk-do province. In the rest of the country, this ratio decreased from 5.56 to 0.63 during the same period. Before the classification system was in place, eight (15.7%) out of the 51 deaths occurred at home or during transfer from home to health-care institutions.

This disease affects 6C 12-day-old post-larvae of Penaeus vannamei and leads to over 90% mortality within 24C 48 h after the first sign of abnormal individuals. The typical gross clinical signs include an empty digestive tract and pale or colorless hepatopancreas, which result in a translucent look of diseased animals. Here, by applying per os infection study, we show that the \\"glass post-larval disease\\" is caused by an infectious agent. Three highly lethal Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains, vp-HL-201910, vp-HL-202005, and vp-HL-202006 are isolated from naturally infected post-larvae collected from different farms. They are very closely related to each other since their 16S rRNA and thermolabile hemolysin genes are identical. These strains reproduce the same pathology in experimental animals and can be successfully re-isolated. The normal structure of hepatopancreas tubule and midgut epithelium is seriously damaged by the representative strain vp-HL-202005. A comparison study suggests that vp-HL-202005 is ~1000 times more virulent than the strain causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease. Moreover, the bacteria-free sonicate supernatant of vp-HL-202005 induces the same symptom in post-larvae shrimp, which strongly suggests that the pathology is caused by a bacterial toxin(s). These findings demonstrate that the \\"glass post-larvae disease\\" is caused by a specific type of highly lethal V. parahaemolyticus. Thus, we rename it \\"highly lethal Vibrio disease\\" (HLVD).

Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional observational study. The study population was 3002 subjects from a single hospital who underwent a health checkup from September 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. The diagnosis of MAFLD was based on the diagnosis of fatty liver in the subject by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) and the presence of one of the following conditions: overweight or obesity (body mass index [BMI]  23), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic abnormalities. The subjects were divided into the GERS group (n = 305) and the non-GERS group (n = 2697) based on the presence or absence of GERS, based on the GerdQ score. Results: The prevalence of MAFLD was significantly higher in the GERS group than in the non-GERS group (p = 0.001). In the univariate analysis of risk factors for GERS, MAFLD was identified as a risk factor for GERS (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.176-1.913; p = 0.001).

Which functional traits best distinguish the weed communities of more and less extensively managed fields? Can the same traits predict the rarity of individual weed species? LOCATION: Hungary. METHODS: Using relev data from 60 cereal and 70 stubble fields, together with weed trait data, we characterized community responses to arable intensification using functional trait analyses based on trait\\\\convergence and trait\\\\divergence assembly patterns. We also examined how well the broad\\\\scale rarity status of species predicts their occurrence along intensification gradients, and how it maps onto our functional classifications describing intensification responses. RESULTS: The response of weeds to intensification in cereal fields was best described by a functional classification based on species' flowering duration, maximum height and seed weight: weeds of extensively managed fields have short flowering seasons (2C5 mo) and particularly large or small seeds. The highest proportions of rare species also happen to be found in these groups. The rarest weeds among these species tend to be late\\\\winter and early\\\\summer annuals, while the rare species of stubble fields tend to be broad\\\\leaved with low nitrogen requirements, small seeds and short height. Stubble fields showed a decline in weed cover with increasing application of fertilizer and distance from the field edge, but we could detect no strong associations of management factors with trait composition, perhaps because the intensification gradient across these fields was shorter. CONCLUSIONS: Many rare Hungarian weeds are associated with traditional extensive farming practices. They are particularly characterized by short, midsummer flowering periods and by preference for low nitrogen levels, but a range of trait syndromes must be considered to understand their ecology and conservation. Analyses based on trait\\\\divergence patterns, rather than trait\\\\convergence patterns, provide better insights into the functional composition of weed communities, emphasizing the importance of disruptive filters in weed community assembly and the need for improved methods to detect such effects.","output":"Refining rare weed trait syndromes along arable intensification gradients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic since December 2020.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examines the available methods for direct web-based access for patients to diagnostic testing and results in the absence of a health care professional in primary care. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier databases in August 2019 and updated in July 2021. The included studies focused on direct patient access to web-based triage leading to diagnostic testing, self-sampling or testing, or web-based communication of test results. A total of 45 studies were included. The quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: Most studies had a quantitative descriptive design and discussed a combination of services. Diagnostic test services mainly focused on sexually transmitted infections. Overall, the use was high for web-based triage (3046/5000, >50%, who used a triage booked a test), for self-sampling or self-testing kits (83%), and the result service (85%). The acceptability of the test services was high, with 81% preferring home-based testing over clinic-based testing. There was a high rate of follow-up testing or treatment after a positive test (93%). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that direct access to testing and result services had high use rates, was positively evaluated, and led to high rates of follow-up treatment.

However, the effect of GBZK on PM2.5-induced lung injury remains to be elucidated. METHODS: We constructed a mice lung injury model through PM2.5 stimulation and simultaneously performed GBZK gavage treatment. After 4 weeks, the lung tissues of the mice were collected for pathological staining to analyze the degree of damage. The activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidative stress-related factors (superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GSH-Px) were detected by commercial kit in lung tissue. Furthermore, the number of neutrophils and related inflammatory factors (interleukin-1, IL-1; tumor necrosis factor , TNF-; interleukin-6, IL-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were collected and tested to evaluate the effect of GBZK on inflammation. Masson staining was used to detect the level of lung fibrosis in mice. The activation of HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein 1) and NFBp65 (nucleus factor kappa B) in lung tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot. RESULTS: The result revealed that PM2.5 induces lung damage, and GBZK gavage treatment could reduce the degree of injury in a concentration-dependent manner in mice. After GBZK treatment, the MPO activity, MDA content, and oxidative stress level in the lung tissues of mice decreased. And after GBZK treatment, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in BALF and blood were decreased. GBZK treatment also improved pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In addition, we also found that GBZK prevented the up-regulation of the HMGB1/NF-B axis in the lungs of mice. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that GBZK might protect mice from PM2.5-induced lung injury by inhibiting the HMGB1/NFB pathway, thus repressing inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis.","output":"Gu-Ben-Zhi-Ke-Zhong-Yao Alleviated PM2.5-Induced Lung Injury via HMGB1/NF-B Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The authors aim to review available reports on the potential effects of masks on voice and speech parameters.

The assessed voice parameters were divided into self-reported, acoustic and aerodynamic. RESULTS: It was observed that the wearing of a face mask has been shown to induce several changes in voice parameters: (1) self-reportedsignificantly increased vocal effort and fatigue, increased vocal tract discomfort and increased values of voice handicap index (VHI) were observed; (2) acousticsincreased voice intensity, altered formants frequency (F2 and F3) with no changes in fundamental frequency, increased harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) and increased mean spectral values in high-frequency levels (1000C8000 Hz), especially with KN95 mask; (3) aerodynamicsmaximum phonatory time was assessed in only two reports, and showed no alterations. CONCLUSION: Despite the different populations, mask-type scenarios and methodologies described by each study, the results of this review outline the significant changes in voice characteristics with the use of face masks.

This study examined the perceptions of community-dwelling older adults regarding how COVID-19 restricted their daily lives. Six focus-group interviews were conducted with 24 participants (mean age, 78.2  5.5 years) living in urban and rural areas in Japan. Then, a qualitative inductive content analysis was performed. Six themes were generated: fear of infection and public, watchful eyes, consistency in daily personal life, pain from reducing my social life, readiness to endure a restricted life, awareness of positive changes in myself, and concern for a languishing society. There was no change that would make their lives untenable, and they continued their daily personal lives at a minimum level. However, their social lives were reduced, which over the long term can lead to a lost sense of purpose in life. This was reported as an adverse factor in the development of other diseases and functional decline in previous studies. While there is no doubt that infection prevention is important, supporting older adults in engaging in activities that provide a sense of purpose in life could contribute to their present and future overall health including mental health.","output":"Perception of COVID-19 Restrictions on Daily Life among Japanese Older Adults: A Qualitative Focus Group Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged cancer care globally, introducing resource limitations and competing risks into clinical practice. AIMS: To describe the COVID-19 impact on medical oncology care provision in an Australian setting. METHODS: Calvary Mater Newcastle and Newcastle Private Hospital medical oncology data from 1 February to 31 April 2019 versus 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-four inpatient admissions occurred in 2020, 21% less than in 2019. Total inpatient days decreased by 22% (2842 vs 2203). April was most impacted (36% and 44% fewer admissions and inpatient days respectively). Mean length of stay remained unchanged (6.4 vs 6.2 days, P = 0.7). In all, 5072 outpatient consultations were conducted, including 417 new-patient consultations (4% and 6% increase on 2019 respectively). Telephone consultations (0 vs 1380) replaced one-quarter of face-to-face consultations (4859 vs 3623, -25%), with minimal telehealth use (6 vs 69). Day Treatment Centre encounters remained stable (3751 vs 3444, -8%). The proportion of new patients planned for palliative treatment decreased (35% vs 28%, P = 0.04), observation increased (16% vs 23%, P = 0.04) and curative intent treatment was unchanged (both 41%). Recruiting clinical trials decreased by one-third (45 vs 30), two trials were activated (vs 5 in 2019) and 45% fewer patients consented to trial participation (62 vs 34). CONCLUSION: Our medical oncology teams adapted rapidly to COVID-19 with significant changes to care provision, including fewer hospital admissions, a notable transition to telephone-based outpatient clinics and reduced clinical trial activity. The continuum of care was largely defended despite pandemic considerations and growing service volumes.","output":"Business as unusual: medical oncology services adapt and deliver during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for establishing rates of seroconversion in populations, and for seeking evidence for a level of antibody that may be protective against COVID-19 disease.

METHODS: 66 women with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) C confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and their 42 neonates were included in the prospective observational study. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and instrumental data of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period, including pharmacotherapy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: 15 (22.7%) women were asymptomatic, 25 (38%) had mild disease, while moderate and severe forms were detected in 20 (30.2%) and 6 (9.1%) cases, respectively. Additional oxygenation was required in 6 (9%) cases: 4 (6%) received CPAP therapy and 2 (3%) C mechanical ventilation. Main clinical symptoms were cough (51.5%), anosmia (34.9%), and hyperthermia (33.3%). Laboratory changes included increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia, and leukopenia. All pregnant women received low molecular weight heparin and interferon alfa-2b according to the National clinical recommendations. Antimicrobial drugs included Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (46%) and macrolides (28%) or carbapenems in severe cases of disease. Spontaneous abortion was reported in 6.1% of cases. Eight preterm (19%) and 34 term deliveries (81%) occurred. The mean weight of neonates was (3283  477) g, 1- and 5-min Apgar score was (7.8  0.6) and (8.7  0.5), respectively. No cases of neonatal COVID-19 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Mostly, the manifestations of COVID-19 were mild. However, 9% of cases were severe, and could contribute to preterm delivery or maternal morbidity. Main predictors of severe COVID-19 course in pregnant women were a decrease in the levels of erythrocytes and lymphocytes and increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase and CRP. Elimination of the virus in pregnant women required more time due to altered immunity. No evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy and delivery was found.

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of adults (18 years) with terminal heart failure (HF), who underwent HVAD implantation for durable LVAD therapy in our center between October 2009 and March 2020. Primary and secondary end points were all-cause death after implantation and LVAD-associated complications, respectively. We focused the distinct analyses on risk profiles at the time of implantation and implant strategies, i.e., bridge-to-transplant (BTT) or destination therapy (DT). RESULTS A total of 510 patients were included, with 229 and 281 individuals in Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) level 1 (45%) and 2 to 4, respectively. Median follow-up was 26 months (IQR: 5-54 months). Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after HVAD implantation was 66% (95% CI; 61.7-70%), 49.4% (95% CI; 44.9-53.8%), and 37.4% (95% CI; 32.8-42%), not censored for LVAD exchange, LVAD explantation, or heart transplantation. INTERMACS level 1 and peri-operative temporary right heart assistance were independent risk factors for survival. Survival was best in BTT patients undergoing heart transplantation at any time during follow-up. The INTERMACS level at time of HVAD implantation did not affect survival after heart transplantation. Freedom from the combined end point of any device-associated severe complication and death was 44.5% (95% CI; 40-48.8%) at 1-year after implantation. CONCLUSION The HVAD is a reliable pump for durable mechanical circulatory support even in high-risk patients.

In the present study, changes in the spleen proteome at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection in response to MDV infection were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes had occurred at early stages of the disease. In total, 61 protein spots representing 48 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate (FDR)  0.05 and fold change  2) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. Overall, the proteins identified in the present study are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the antigen processing and presentation, ubiquitinCproteasome protein degradation (UPP), formation of the cytoskeleton, cellular metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of translation. Notably, early stages of the disease were characterized by changes in the UPP, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, changes indicative of active cell proliferation as well as apoptosis together with significant changes in cytoskeletal components that were observed throughout the experimental period suggested the complexity of the pathogenesis.

The severity of the situation has become so substantial that many or even most of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms had to self-isolate without specific medical treatments or even without being tested for COVID-19. Many patients joined internet membership groups to exchange information and support each other. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine the benefits and limits of using social media to understand the symptoms of patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms and, in particular, their symptoms of anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste). The voluntary reports on an internet website of a membership group will be the platform of the analyses. METHODS: Posts and comments of members of an internet group known as COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss, founded on March 24, 2020, to support patients with suspected COVID-19 were collected and analyzed daily. Demographic data were collected using the software mechanism called Group Insights on the membership group website. RESULTS: Membership groups on social media have become rare sources of support for patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. These groups provided mental support to their members and became resources for information on COVID-19 tests and medicines or supplements. However, the membership was voluntary, and often the members leave without notification. It is hard to be precise from the free voluntary reports. The number of women in the group (6995/9227, 75.38% as of October 12, 2020) was about three times more than men (2272/9227, 24.62% as of October 12, 2020), and the peak age of members was between 20-40 years in both men and women. Patients who were asymptomatic other than the senses comprised 14.93% (53/355) of the total patients. Recovery of the senses was higher in the patients who were asymptomatic besides having anosmia and ageusia. Most (112/123, 91.06%) patients experienced other symptoms first and then lost their senses, on average, 4.2 days later. Patients without other symptoms tended to recover earlier (P=.02). Patients with anosmia and ageusia occasionally reported distorted smell and taste (parosmia and dysgeusia) as well as experiencing or perceiving the smell and taste without the sources of the smell or taste (phantosmia and phantogeusia). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the social media database of suspected COVID-19 patients' voices demonstrated that, although accurate diagnosis of patients is not always obtained with social media-based analyses, it may be a useful tool to collect a large amount of data on symptoms and the clinical course of worldwide rapidly growing infectious diseases.","output":"Loss of Smell and Taste in Patients With Suspected COVID-19: Analyses of Patients' Reports on Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract.

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly important to contain disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting their intention to use this platform. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use. Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \\"strongly disagree\\" (1 point) to \\"strongly agree\\" (5 points). Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software. RESULTS: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected (female: 219/350, 62.6%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0%; university-level education: 228/350, 65.1%; occupation as student: 195/350, 56.6%; average monthly income <NT $30,000 [<US $1054.89]: 230/350, 65.7%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4%; and health status perceived as \\"good\\": 171/350, 48.9%).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional online thirty-six-item Google Survey. The survey queried demographics and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. SETTING: The survey was distributed to Israeli Dietetic Association (ATID) mailing list between 31 March and 5 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical dietitians, members of ATID, who consented to participated in the survey. RESULTS: Three hundred dietitians (12 % of ATID members; 95 % women; mean age 441 (sd 102) years) replied to the survey. Most dietitians reported a significant a30 % decrease in work hours due to the pandemic. The most prevalent form of alternative nutrition counselling (ANC) was over the phone (72 %); 535 % used online platforms. Nearly 45 % had no former ANC experience. Both ANC formats were reported inferior to face-to-face nutritional consultation (consultation quality median scores 8 and 7, on a 1-10 scale, for online and phone, respectively). ANC difficulties on either phone or online platforms were technical (56 and 47 %, respectively), lack of anthropometric measurements (28 and 25 %, respectively) and interpersonal communication (19 and 146 %, respectively). Older age and former phone counselling experience were associated with higher quality scores, respectively (OR = 1046, 95 % CI 101, 108, P = 0005), (95 % CI 138, 452, P = 002). Those who continued to work full time had five-time greater odds for a higher quality score using online platforms (OR = 533, 95 % CI 1091, 1489, P = 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest telemedicine holds considerable promise for dietary consultation; however, additional tools and training are needed to optimise remote ANC, especially in light of potential crisis-induced lockdown.","output":"Virtual nutrition consultation: what can we learn from the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious, life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent findings indicate an increased risk of acute kidney injury during COVID-19. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acute kidney injury in COVID-19 are unclear, but may include direct cytopathic effects of the virus on kidney tubular and endothelial cells, indirect damage caused by virus-induced cytokine release, and kidney hypoperfusion due to a restrictive fluid strategy. In this case-report we propose an additional pathophysiological mechanism. We describe two cases in which patients with COVID-19 developed a decrease in kidney function due to kidney infarction. These patients did not have atrial fibrillation. One of these patients was treated with therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin, whereafter no further deterioration of kidney function was observed.

With the advent of government campaigns to increase awareness of data privacy and information sources, we investigate how the landscape of internet postings has changed for CF and how this could affect patients seeking online medical information. Methods: Key phrases relating to CF were identified by a CF multidisciplinary team and entered in Google Alerts with prospective tracking for 6 months in 2015. Alerts were also created for 3 non-orphan lung diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung fibrosis). These steps were repeated again in 2019 and the data compared. Results: In 2015, Asthma received the highest mean number of alerts per day (31.7), followed by CF (16.1), then COPD (14.6), and Lung Fibrosis (5.1). This changed in 2019 where CF was the highest with 19.5, followed by Asthma (11.5), COPD (10.3), and Lung Fibrosis (7.4). In both years, the USA generated (56%) the highest number of alerts for CF. There was an increased number of blocked articles in 2019 (540). In 2015, News (58%) was the most common category for CF alerts, but this changed to Financial/Marketing (35%) in 2019. In 2015 there was a small number of Social Media alerts recorded for all lung conditions;however, in 2019, there were none for the comparative lung conditions and only 3 for CF. Alert frequency for CF-related terms also increased in 2019. Conclusion: The landscape for internet postings for CF has changed. CF is now more commonly reported than other lung conditions and the business of CF is now more frequently reported online while content from the general public has decreased (or is private).

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of an in-house developed face shield based on feedback by HCWs and its usage in triaging zones and operation theatre in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A protective face shield was developed and distributed among the orthopaedic surgeons and front line HCWs involved in the ICU in our hospital and neighbouring facilities. Feedback was obtained using a questionnaire utilising a Likert scale. RESULTS: 227 face shields were distributed to the HCWs in our hospital (157) and neighbouring facilities (70). Design modifications were done as per the needs of the HCWs. 37 HCWs provided feedback giving the face shields an overall mean score of 7.92 out of 10. The poly vinyl chloride (PVC) film visors were better for airway management procedures as it can be tucked into PPE suit and visors with overhead projector (OHP) sheets were suitable for ICU and operative procedures. CONCLUSION: A locally developed face shield design by an inter disciplinary team in synchrony with HCWs is found to increase its acceptability and efficacy.

Results showed that Bu-Yang herbs could interact with ESR1 and estrogen signaling pathways. For further validation, the Bu-Yang decoction (BYD), formula consisted of the above-mentioned 4 Bu-Yang herbs was presented for experimental validation.

The spatial network structure of settlements therefore imposes a fundamental constraint on the spatial distribution of the population through which a communicable disease can spread. In this analysis we use the spatial network structure of lighted development as a proxy for the distribution of ambient population to compare the spatiotemporal evolution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the USA and China. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band sensor on the NASA/NOAA Suomi satellite has been imaging night light at ~ 700 m resolution globally since 2012. Comparisons with sub-kilometer resolution census observations in different countries across different levels of development indicate that night light luminance scales with population density over ~ 3 orders of magnitude. However, VIIRS constant ~ 700 m resolution can provide a more detailed representation of population distribution in peri-urban and rural areas where aggregated census blocks lack comparable spatial detail. By varying the low luminance threshold of VIIRS-derived night light, we depict spatial networks of lighted development of varying degrees of connectivity within which populations are distributed. The resulting size distributions of spatial network components (connected clusters of nodes) vary with degree of connectivity, but maintain consistent scaling over a wide range (5  to 10  in area & number) of network sizes. At continental scales, spatial network rank-size distributions obtained from VIIRS night light brightness are well-described by power laws with exponents near ?2 (slopes near ?1) for a wide range of low luminance thresholds. The largest components (10(4) to 10(5) km(2)) represent spatially contiguous agglomerations of urban, suburban and periurban development, while the smallest components represent isolated rural settlements. Projecting county and city-level numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for the USA and China (respectively) onto the corresponding spatial networks of lighted development allows the spatiotemporal evolution of the epidemic (infection and detection) to be quantified as propagation within networks of varying connectivity. Results for China show rapid nucleation and diffusion in January 2020 followed by rapid decreases in new cases in February. While most of the largest cities in China showed new confirmed cases approaching zero before the end of February, most of these cities also showed distinct second waves of cases in March or April. Whereas new cases in Wuhan did not approach zero until mid-March, as of December 2020 it has not yet experienced a second wave of cases. In contrast, the results for the USA show a wide range of trajectories, with an abrupt transition from slow increases in confirmed cases in a small number of network components in January and February, to rapid geographic dispersion to a larger number of components shortly before mobility reductions occurred in March. Results indicate that while most of the upper tail of the network had been exposed by the end of March, the lower tail of the component size distribution has only shown steep increases since mid-June.","output":"Spatiotemporal evolution of COVID-19 infection and detection within night light networks: comparative analysis of USA and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AI and Robots represent a major innovation opportunity for the tourism sector, and their potential impact and application offer several new opportunities to enhance and develop the visitor experience.

Our recent work has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein activates the cellular TMEM16F chloride channel and scramblase. Through a screening on >3,000 FDA/EMA approved drugs, we identified Niclosamide and Clofazimine as the most effective molecules at inhibiting this activity. As TMEM16F plays an important role in the stimulation of the pro-coagulant activity of platelets, and considering that platelet abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, we investigated whether Spike directly affects platelet activation and pro-thrombotic function and tested the effect of Niclosamide and Clofazimine on these processes. MethodsWe produced SARS-CoV-2 Spike or VSV-G protein-pseudotyped virions, or generated cells expressing Spike on their plasma membrane, and tested their effects on platelet adhesion (fluorescence), aggregation (absorbance), exposure of phosphatidylserine (flow cytometry for annexin V binding), calcium flux (flow cytometry for fluo-4 AM), and clot formation and retraction. These experiments were also conducted in the presence of the TMEM16F activity inhibitors Niclosamide and Clofazimine. ResultsHere we show that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes platelet activation, adhesion and spreading, both when present on the envelope of virions or upon expression on the plasma membrane of cells. Spike was effective both as a sole agonist or by enhancing the effect of known platelet activators, such as collagen and collagen-related peptide. In particular, Spike exerted a noticeable effect on the procoagulant phenotype of platelets, by enhancing calcium flux, phosphatidylserine externalisation, and thrombin generation. Eventually, this resulted in a striking increase in thrombin-induced clot formation and retraction. Both Niclosamide and Clofazimine almost abolished this Spike-induced pro-coagulant response. ConclusionsTogether, these findings provide a pathogenic mechanism to explain thrombosis associated to COVID-19 lung disease, by which Spike present in SARS-CoV-2 virions or exposed on the surface of infected cells, leads to local platelet stimulation and subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade. As platelet TMEM16F is central in this process, these findings reinforce the rationale of repurposing drugs targeting this protein, such as Niclosamide, for COVID-19 therapy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein activates TMEM16F-mediated platelet pro-coagulant activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease-19;Vaccine Hesitancy;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Adverse Effects INTRODUCTION Vaccination is one of the most successful public health interventions of modern medicine.

Detection of neutral lipids by mass spectrometry (MS) is challenging due to interference from impurities, particularly when working with minute-volume meibum samples. Here, we describe procedures for sample preparation and MS analysis of these elusive meibum lipids that can be used to examine dry eye disease mechanisms.

To date, a causal model of childrens vicarious traumatization has not been empirically validated in the literature. This paper fills the gap in the literature by reporting on the direct effect of vicarious trauma on children independent of caregiving impairment. Data for the study came from the National Survey of Childrens Exposure to Violence I (NATSCEV I). This unique dataset features two indicators of vicarious trauma exposure: (1) family victimization and (2) community violence. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted in order to control for nuisance variables such as caregiver impairment, defined as the degree of warmth or hostility; time elapsed since the trauma occurred and the study taking place; and other trauma exposure (i.e. direct and witnessed trauma). As expected, the study found evidence of a direct and positive relationship between learning about the trauma of close friends and family and childrens trauma symptomatology. Both adolescents and young children were found to be vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization, with gender and ethnicity being contributing factors. Chronological age was not found to be significant in childrens vicarious traumatization. These findings support the causal model of vicarious traumatization. They demonstrate that children may be traumatized by exposure to the trauma material of others above and beyond the influence of caregiver impairment. As such, attention should be given to interventions, practices, and policies that intervene in the lives of children exposed to violence.","output":"A Causal Model of Childrens Vicarious Traumatization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethiopia implemented public health measures to curve COVID pandemics earlier than many countries Airport screening, followed by partial closure of international flights and quarantine of all international travelers have slowed the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemics in its early phase Early adoption of Public health measures including hand hygiene and use of facemask have also contributed to the slow trajectory seen in the early days of the pandemics Unfortunately, early gains have been beset by slow scale-up of public health measures, recent lifting of the state of emergency and public fatigue Hospitals are already at capacity and not equipped to handle even the lowest estimate the country expects at the peak of the pandemic To mitigate the impact of the pandemics, Ethiopia must return to the basics of public health measures: increase testing, upscale contact tracing, social distancing and universal use of face mask quickly and across the country [Ethiop J Health Dev 2020;34(4):307-309] ? 2020, Ethiopian Journal of Health Development All Rights Reserved","output":"COVID-19 response in Ethiopia: Challenges and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with cardiac arrhythmias in hospitalized patients, but data from the ICU setting are limited. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of cardiac arrhythmias in ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including all ICU patients with an airway sample positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 from March 1st to June 1st in the Capital Region of Denmark (1.8 million inhabitants). We registered cardiac arrhythmias in ICU, potential risk factors, interventions used in ICU and outcomes. RESULTS: From the seven ICUs we included 155 patients with COVID-19. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in the ICU was 57/155 (37%, 95% confidence interval 30-45), and 39/57 (68%) of these patients had this as new-onset arrhythmia. Previous history of tachyarrhythmias and higher disease severity at ICU admission were associated with cardiac arrhythmias in the adjusted analysis. Fifty-four of the 57 (95%) patients had supraventricular origin of the arrhythmia, 39/57 (68%) received at least one intervention against arrhythmia (eg amiodarone, IV fluid or magnesium) and 38/57 (67%) had recurrent episodes of arrhythmia in ICU. Patients with arrhythmias in ICU had higher 60-day mortality (63%) as compared to those without arrhythmias (39%). CONCLUSION: New-onset supraventricular arrhythmias were frequent in ICU patients with COVID-19 and were related to previous history of tachyarrhythmias and severity of the acute disease.

Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patients hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/l, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.","output":"Graves disease-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance The population of infants, children, and adolescents cared for at pediatric long-term care facilities is increasing in complexity and size and thus consumes substantial health care resources. Infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, but few recent data describe their incidence and effects. Objectives To describe the types of infections diagnosed in residents of pediatric long-term care facilities, calculate infection rates, and identify risk factors for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study, which was part of a larger trial called Keep It Clean for Kids, was conducted from September 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, at 3 pediatric long-term care facilities in New York. Residents of the facilities who were 21 years or younger and either residents or admitted during the study period (n = 717) were enrolled in the study. Medical records were reviewed to identify infections diagnosed by site clinicians. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of infections, such as RTIs; skin and soft-tissue infections; chronic comorbid conditions, including neurologic and respiratory disorders; and device use, including gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies, was determined. Risk factors for RTIs were assessed by generalized linear mixed method regression modeling. Results The 717 residents had a median (interquartile range) age at enrollment of 2.6 (0.4-9.1) years; 358 (49.9%) were male. Four hundred twenty-eight residents (59.7%) had feeding tubes and 215 (30.0%) had tracheostomies. Most chronic comorbid conditions were musculoskeletal or ambulation (532 residents [74.2%]), neurologic (505 [70.4%]), respiratory (361 [50.3%]), and gastrointestinal (230 [32.1%]) disorders, and 460 residents (64.2%) had 4 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Site clinicians diagnosed 2052 infections during the 3-year study period. Respiratory tract infections were most common and were diagnosed in 1291 residents (62.9%). The overall infection rate was 5.3 infections per 1000 resident-days, and RTI rates were 3.3 infections per 1000 resident-days. Overall infection rates and rates of RTI, skin and soft-tissue infection, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection varied among the 3 sites. In the multivariable model, younger age (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06), increased number of chronic comorbid conditions (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.19), and the use of feeding tubes (IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64) and tracheostomies (IRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.69) were associated with RTIs. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, RTIs were the most common infections diagnosed, but modifiable risk factors for RTIs were not identified. Future work should focus on optimizing infection prevention and control strategies to reduce infections, particularly RTIs, in the pediatric long-term care population.","output":"Incidence, Risks, and Types of Infections in Pediatric Long-term Care Facilities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aside from specific environmental conditions, poor agricultural practices contribute to mold and thus the mycotoxin contamination of crops.

METHODS Cohort of hospitalized patients with TIA and stroke discharged alive from a large university hospital in Norway, and their informal caregivers. Questionnaires at 3 and 12 months post discharge were filled out by caregivers (n = 320 and n = 326, respectively) and survivors (n = 368 and n = 383, respectively). Multivariable linear regression analyses tested associations between initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) in caregivers and survivors. RESULTS Caregivers of survivors with TIA or stroke did not report lower HRQoL than matched norms. There was some evidence of an association of the NIHSS with caregiver HRQoL at 3 months only (age-sex-adjusted coefficient - 0.01, p = 0.008), however, this was attenuated after additional adjustments. Survivors with stroke, but not TIA, reported lower HRQoL than population norms at both time points. There was a negative association between higher NIHSS scores and survivors' HRQoL; fully adjusted coefficient - 0.01 at both time points (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION The informal caregivers and survivors with TIA did not report lower than expected HRQoL. Increasing stroke severity was associated with decreasing HRQoL among survivors, but had limited predictive value among caregivers. Other factors may therefore be better indicators of 'at risk' caregivers.","output":"The association of stroke severity with health-related quality of life in survivors of acute cerebrovascular disease and their informal caregivers during the first year post stroke: a survey study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Villages are consumer-driven organizations that promote aging-in-place.

To achieve this goal, we measure the Chinese public-health expenditure at national and provincial levels based on our definition, and then compare it with the expenditures of other countries. The results show that: (1) the level of public-health expenditure in China is relatively low and far lower than that in developed countries; (2) Chinese governments have not paid enough attention to the prevention and control of major public-health emergencies, which may be an important reason for the outbreak of COVID-19; (3) Chinese public-health expenditure shows a fluctuating growth trend, but the growth rate is so slow that it is lower than that of GDP and fiscal expenditure; (4) although the Chinese government inclines the public-health expenditure to the poor provinces in central and western regions, the imbalance and inequity of public-health resource allocation are still expanding among provinces; (5) there is a lot of waste of resources in the public-health system, which seriously reduces the efficiency of public-health expenditure in China. Therefore, the Chinese government should improve the quantity and quality of public-health expenditure in the above aspects.","output":"How the Chinese Government Has Done with Public Health from the Perspective of the Evaluation and Comparison about Public-Health Expenditure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus has generated a pandemic, in which there are population groups at higher risk and who are potentially fatal victims of the disease.

This enigmatic virus characteristically affects the respiratory system. Atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, and cases of encephalopathy have also been reported. However, psychiatric symptoms as the initial presenting feature is novel. We describe one such case. CASE PRESENTATION: 53-year-old man with no prior psychiatric or significant medical history was brought to the emergency department after ingesting bleach in an apparent suicide attempt. On initial presentation, the patient was uncooperative and withdrawn, though alert and oriented. He subsequently developed fever, tachycardia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and transaminases. SARS CoV-2 was confirmed on RT-PCR. Neurological examination was non-contributory. As his clinical condition improved, the patient reported that his initial symptom was an auditory hallucination telling him to jump from a bridge or ingest bleach. He reported that the increasing intensity of his auditory hallucinations led him to act upon it. He denied mood symptoms or suicidal ideation. The hallucinations did not recur during the hospital course, but he required 3 doses of antipsychotic medication for agitation. After improvement of his SARS CoV-2 infection, he was free of psychiatric symptoms and was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation center. CONCLUSION: This case indicates that what appears as a sudden onset of a psychiatric illness in the current context may be an initial manifestation of a developing COVID illness.","output":"Command Suicidal Hallucination as Initial Presentation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last 30 years, our concept of cryptosporidiosis has changed from that of a rare, largely asymptomatic disease, to an important cause of diarrhea in animals and humans worldwide.

Factors that have contributed to the emergence of cryptosporidiosis in animals include biological features of the organism, the lack of an effective treatment or preventative, increased environmental contamination, and trends in livestock production. In humans the zoonotic nature of infection and an increased at-risk population have contributed to disease.

The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new name coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for this disease, whereas the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy renamed 2019-nCov as SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). The development of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only of great social importance, but also draws the attention of a medical community to the fundamentally new clinical and fundamental problems of the immunopathology of human diseases that are yet to be formulated. The unique experience gained in rheumatology from studies of the pathogenetic mechanisms and pharmacotherapy of immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMIRDs) can be of great importance for deciphering the nature of the pathological processes that underlie the severe, potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, and may assist in improving their therapy. As for prospects in patients with IMIRDs, although the development of COVID-19 in the presence of IMIRDs has not yet fortunately been described, infection with SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, can be assumed to cause an exacerbation of the pathological process, whereas severe immune system pathology and comorbidities can worsen the course of infection. Since, according to the current concepts, it is the ?hyperimmune? response, and not just the effect only of the virus itself, that underlies lung damage and deaths from COVID-19, special attention is drawn to the effects of antirheumatic therapy that includes glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biological agents, and targeted DMARDs, which can have a multidirectional effect on the course of COVID-19. There are significant theoretical prerequisites for the repurposing of some drugs widely used in rheumatology for the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Consideration is given to the prospects of studying the immunopathology of COVID-19 and to the theoretical justifications for the use of antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and Janus kinase inhibitors for the prevention of complications and for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Rheumatological Prospects/Relevance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we judge the predictability of EUA's own short- and long-term asymmetry, extreme observations, as well as jump components on its volatility by comparing the GARCH mixed frequency data sampling model and its asymmetry, extreme observation and jump extensions.

Among all jump extension models, the model extended by only the short-term jump information and the model extended by both the short-term and long-term jump information perform better, and their forecasting performance outperform all the other extension models in most cases. These findings are robust even if the assessment method, the rolling window length and the lag order are changed.

Governments have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to 100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program. However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost. However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy. Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and quite surprising. They are patent-free.

An understanding of political economy is required in order to come to terms with the bases of PHC and the fundamentals of UHC that dealing with inequities is not only an economic issue but fundamentally a political issue. Neoliberal decision-making can enhance inequities in society. Two chronic health conditions, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, are examples of conditions that lead to costly and debilitating consequences for patients but also lead to substantial economic costs in terms of lost workforce participation and lost productivity. These cases demonstrate the socio-political issues involved in the management of care for a number of illnesses. The upsurge of COVID-19 has placed an enormous strain on health and broader social and economic resources and challenged the pretext of UHC as health for all: substantial differences in equity and political commitment have emerged. Sturmberg and Martin argue that the joining of UHC and PHC needs leadership, which involves local communities and resourcing. PHC is a changing system based on power relationships involving funders and the health community. In Australia as in several countries, out-of-pocket costs have grown rapidly and have affected access for some groups to PHC and have challenged the pretext of equity in UHC.

Shorter aliphatic chain or higher concentrations of PGFEs resulted in smaller droplets in the emulsions before and during digestion. PGFEs concentration had different impacts on lipolysis dynamics of nanoemulsions depending on the aliphatic chain lengths of PGFEs. Furthermore, long aliphatic chain of PGFEs contributed to a greater rate and extent of lipolysis, but a lower bioaccessibility of curcumin compared with medium ones, which was attributed to the formation of insoluble calcium soaps induced by calcium ions. These results are expected to facilitate the application of PGFEs for developing optimized nanoemulsions in encapsulating poorly water-soluble nutraceuticals in functional food industry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve pigs (47  3.3 kg) were equipped for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and randomly assigned to Standard (n = 6) vs. valve-less (n = 6) insufflation. Animals were positioned in a 30 Trendelenburg on a CT scan bed. A low-pressure pneumoperitoneum (8 mmHg) was started and duration was set for 180 min. Abdominal CT scans were performed, under neuromuscular blockade, before, immediately after, and 1 and 3 h after insufflation. Pneumoperitoneum volumes were calculated on 3D reconstructed CT scans. After creation of a mesenteric window, capillary blood was obtained by puncturing the sigmoid serosa and local lactatemia (mmol/L) was measured using a handheld analyzer. Surgical resection was performed according to the level of lactates, in order to standardize bowel stump perfusion. IL-1 and IL-6 (ng/mL) were measured repeatedly. The peritoneum was sampled close to the surgical site and distantly for the oxygraphic assessment of mitochondrial respiration. A pathologist applied a semi-quantitative score to evaluate the anastomosis. RESULTS Mean arterial pressure, pulse, body temperature, oximetry, systemic lactatemia, and local lactates were similar. IL-6 was lower in the valve-less group, reaching a statistically significant difference after 3 h of insufflation (64.85  32.5 vs. 133.95  59.73; p = 0.038) and 48 h (77.53  68.4 vs. 190.74  140.79; p = 0.029). Peritoneal mitochondrial respiration was significantly increased after the survival period, with no difference among the groups. The anastomoses in the valve-less group demonstrated a lower acute (p = 0.04) inflammatory infiltration.

It is possible symptom provocation of vestibular or ocular function is related to unsteady gait patterns during tandem gait. Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in temporal and center of pressure (CoP) metrics during discrete events of instrumented tandem gait (iTG) among those with sport-related concussion (SRC) compared to healthy controls. Secondarily, this study attempted to evaluate the relationship between iTG CoP metrics and the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) Exam. Materials and Methods: 30 collegiate athletes with SRC and 30 healthy controls completed three single task (ST) iTG trials on an instrumented walkway and the VOMS. All individuals with SRC were assessed within 24-48 h post-injury while all controls were measured during pre-participation physicals. CoP metrics in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions and time to completion were evaluated during the first, turn and second pass of iTG between groups. VOMS score was correlated to the CoP metrics across the discrete events. Results: Athletes with SRC took longer to complete tandem gait (P<0.001) along with the first pass, second pass but not the turn when compared to the control group. SRC had slower velocity in the AP direction during both the first (P<0.001) and second pass (P<0.001) with increased postural sway in the ML direction during the first pass (P=0.014). During the turn, athletes with SRC had postural sway in the ML direction (P=0.008). Finally, VOMS score was weakly negatively related to CoP velocity in the AP direction during first (r=-0.39) and second (r=-0.36) pass while being weakly positively related to postural sway during the turn (r=-0.30). Conclusions: Athletes with SRC adopted a more conservative walking pattern and the presence of vestibular and/or ocular symptoms influence the ability to perform heel-to-toe walking. Relevance for patients: Individuals with SRC will walk slower during heel-to-toe walking and move more in the ML direction with great movement in the ML direction while en pointe turning. This may increase given the total amount of vestibular or vision symptoms following the SRC.","output":"Sport-related concussion adopt a more conservative approach to straight path walking and turning during tandem gait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nepal has been identified in a high-risk zone by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) Nepals first official reported case was confirmed on 13 January 2020 and so far, 24,000 cases have tested positive with 91 deaths The imposition of lockdown has begun since March 24 and it was extended until 22 July Reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction and rapid diagnostic tests are used by the Government of Nepal to identify COVID-19 Among the worst-hit sectors are tourism as well as travel and the farming industries, the later contributes to the employment of around 65% of the population and a significant share of the national economy The loss of commercial sectors, such as dairy, feed, and poultry industries are estimated to be in billions of rupees One shortcoming of resource poorly managed countries, such as Nepal is the lack of interdisciplinary coordination Over half a decade long professional existence and crucial contributions in Nepals overall development, veterinarians are just beginning to be recognized as essential service providers Since veterinarians of Nepal have the experience of eradicating cattle plague dealing with Avian Influenza and Swine Flu among others, they study and seem to be mentally prepared to handle pandemics Currently, five veterinary diseases diagnostic laboratories with RT-PCR facilities are serving as COVID-19 diagnosis labs Veterinarians from Nepal are serving in innovating newer tools as well as performing, supervising, evaluating, reporting diagnosis, and actively in pursuit of establishing the One Health (OH) approach The sincere and patriotic role played by veterinarians has pressurized the government of Nepal to recognize veterinary service as an essential commodity In this regard, universities should take the lead and bring veterinarians in policy and planning as well as decision making The Tribhuvan University is responsible to have the initiative and Agriculture and Forestry University to deliver the missed opportunities The 17 sustainable development goals that are to be achieved by 2030 are not possible without a multi-sectoral approach and veterinarians are best suited in this regard It also needs to be realized that veterinarians are better positioned to handle emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases and capable of combating the present situation of COVID19 pandemics Reiterating the fact that OH approach should not only be in paper and there is no alternative but combined utilization of scarce resources for healthy animals, humans, and the environment with the veterinary profession at its core ? 2020 All Rights Reserved","output":"Contribution of Veterinary Sector to Control COVID-19 Pandemic in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patient\\\\reported outcomes (PROs) are an integral part of treat\\\\to\\\\target approaches in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In clinical practice, however, routine collection, documentation, and discussion of PROs with patients are highly variable. The RISE LC (Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Learning Collaborative) was established to develop and share best practices in PRO collection and use across adult rheumatology practices in the United States METHODS: The goals of the RISE LC were developed through site surveys and in\\\\person meetings. Participants completed a baseline survey on PRO collection and use in their practices. RISE LC learning sessions focused on improving communication around PROs with patients and enhancing shared decision\\\\making in treatment plans. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, the RISE LC pivoted to adapt PRO tools for telehealth. RESULTS: At baseline, all responding sites (n = 15) had established workflows for collecting PROs. Most sites used paper forms alone. PRO documentation in electronic health records was variable, with only half of the sites using structured data fields. To standardize and improve the use of PROs, participants iteratively developed a Clinical Disease Activity IndexCbased RA Disease Activity Communication Tool to solicit treatment goals and improve shared decision\\\\making across sites. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic necessitated developing a tool to gauge PROs via telehealth.

We look at this evolution of a relatively new work task for Advanced Practice Nurses using a countervailing powers perspective, which allows us to move beyond discussions of case management effectiveness and best practices, and draw connections to trends in the social organization of healthcare, especially hospitals. We evaluated organizational (hospital-level) and environmental (county and state-level) characteristics associated with hospitals' use of Advanced Practice Nurses as case managers, using data from U.S. community acute care hospitals for 2016-2018, collected from three data sources: American Hospital Association annual survey (AHA), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and Area Resource File. Among organizational characteristics, we found that hospitals that are a part of established Accountable Care Organizations (OR = 2.55, p = 0.009; 95% CI = 1.26-5.14) and those that serve higher acuity patients, as indicated by possessing a higher Case Mix Index (OR = 1.32, p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.13-1.55), were more likely to use Advanced Practice Nurses as case managers.

It builds on a previous work by the authors in which Bayesian analysis is applied to rheological micromechanical models in cement paste, self-compacting mortar, and self-compacting concrete. As a consequence of the varied characteristics of the particles in these suspensions (in terms of materials, shapes, size distributions, etc.), as well as their random nature, it seems appropriate to study these systems with probabilistic models. The Bayesian analysis, thorough Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling methods, allows the conversion of parametric-deterministic models into parametric-probabilistic models, which results in enrichment in engineering and science. The incorporation of steel fibers requires a new term in the model to account for their effect on the dynamic viscosity of SCSFRC, and this new term is also treated here with the Bayesian approach. The paper uses an extensive collection of experimental data to obtain the probability density functions of the parameters for assessing the dynamic viscosity in SCSFRC. The results obtained with these parameters' distributions are much better than those calculated with the theoretical values of the parameters, which indicates that Bayesian methods are appropriated to respond to questions in complex systems with complex models.","output":"Probabilistic Assessment of the Dynamic Viscosity of Self-Compacting Steel-Fiber Reinforced Concrete through a Micromechanical Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic, especially when caused by a novel virus, induces tremendous uncertainty, fear, and anxiety.

We previously identified a wide distribution of atherectomy practice patterns among US physicians. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of index atherectomy with reintervention. METHODS 100% Medicare fee-for-service claims were used to identify all beneficiaries who underwent elective first-time femoropopliteal peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) for claudication between 1/1/2019-12/31/2019. Subsequent PVI reinterventions were examined through 6/30/2021. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the rate of PVI reinterventions for patients who received index atherectomy vs. non-atherectomy procedures. Reintervention rates were also described for physicians by their overall atherectomy use (by quartile). A hierarchical Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate patient and physician-level characteristics associated with reinterventions. RESULTS A total of 15,246 patients underwent index PVI for claudication in 2019, of which 59.7% were atherectomy. After a median of 603 days (IQR 77, 784) of follow-up, 41.2% of patients underwent a PVI reintervention, including 48.9% of patients who underwent index atherectomy vs. 29.8% of patients who underwent index non-atherectomy (P<0.001). Patients treated by high physician users of atherectomy (quartile 4) received more reinterventions than patients treated by standard physician users (quartiles 1-3) (56.8% vs. 39.6%, P<0.001). After adjustment, patient factors association with PVI reintervention included receipt of index atherectomy (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.21-1.46), Black race (vs. White, aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.34), diabetes (aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.21), and urban residence (aHR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22). Physician factors associated with reintervention included male sex (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.04), high-volume PVI practices (aHR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37), and physicians with high use of index atherectomy (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.27-1.74). Vascular surgeons had a lower risk of PVI reintervention than Cardiologists (vs. Vascular, aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.38), Radiologists (aHR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.83), and other specialties (aHR 1.59, 95% CI 1.20-2.11). Location of services delivered was not associated with reintervention (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The use of atherectomy as an index PVI for claudication is associated with higher PVI reintervention rates compared to non-atherectomy procedures. Similarly, high physician users of atherectomy perform more PVI reinterventions than their peers. The appropriateness of using atherectomy for initial treatment of claudication needs critical reevaluation.","output":"Index Atherectomy Peripheral Vascular Interventions Performed for Claudication are Associated with More Reinterventions than Non-Atherectomy Interventions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccines have been developed at an unparalleled speed, with 14 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccines currently authorized.

The objective of this study was to confidentially administer a validated screening tool in a pediatric emergency department by using an electronic tablet to identify minors at risk for sex trafficking. Our hypothesis was that this modality of administration would adequately identify high-risk patients. METHODS English- and Spanish-speaking patients from the ages of 12 to 17 years presenting to a large urban pediatric emergency department with high-risk chief complaints were enrolled in a prospective cohort over 13 months. Subjects completed a previously validated 6-item screening tool on an electronic tablet. The screening tool's sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify additional risk factors. RESULTS A total of 212 subjects were enrolled (72.6% female; median age: 15 years; interquartile range 13-16), of which 26 patients were subjected to child sex trafficking (prevalence: 12.3%). The sensitivity and specificity of the electronic screening tool were 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 70.8%-98.5%) and 53.2% (95% CI 46.1%-60.4%), respectively.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline comorbidity rates and illness severity were high, notably for ischemic heart disease (32%). The Hb difference among groups was 13.8 g/L (95% CI, 11.5-16.0 g/L); p<0.0001); mean Hb during intervention was 81.9 (SD, 5.1) versus 95.7 (6.3) g/L; 21.6% fewer patients in the restrictive group were transfused postrandomization (p<0.001) and received a median 1 (95% CI, 1-2; p=0.002) fewer RBC units. Protocol compliance was high. No major differences in organ dysfunction, duration of ventilation, infections, or cardiovascular complications were observed during intensive care and hospital follow-up. Mortality at 180 days postrandomization trended toward higher rates in the liberal group (55%) than in the restrictive group (37%); relative risk was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.44-1.05; p=0.073).

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed home office implementation and use data from the psychiatric university hospitals information technology services. We also conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey to assess the employees attitudes toward the clinics crisis management during the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Part of this web-based survey consisted of questions about home office use between March and June 2020, attitudes toward home office implementation, and mental health. Three mental health measures assessed depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]C2), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder [GAD]C2), and stress factors (stress module of the PHQ-D); a cut-off score 3 was used for the PHQ-2 and GAD-2. RESULTS: Of the 200 participating employees, 69 reported that they had worked from home at least partially (34.5%). Home office use differed significantly across professional groups ((16)(2)=72.72, P.001, n=200). Employees experienced neither depressive symptoms (mean 0.76, SD 1.14) nor anxiety (mean 0.70, SD 1.03). The employees reported minor psychosocial stressors (mean 2.83, SD 2.92). The number of reported stress factors varied significantly across groups with different levels of home office use ((4)(2)=9.72, P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: In general, home office implementation appears to be feasible for large psychiatric hospitals, however, it is not equally feasible for all professional groups. Professional groups that require personal contact with patients and technical or manual tasks must work onsite. Further evaluation of home office use in psychiatric hospitals up to the development of clinics that function merely online will follow in future research.

When the patient re-started feeding by gastrostomy tube after 5 days of therapeutic fasting due to gastric ulcer caused by gastrostomy tube irritation, he presented postprandial vomiting, abdominal distention, and tachycardia. Since fasting, his weight has been reduced by about 3akg. DIAGNOSIS: Based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings, diagnose of SMAS was finally made. Abdomen computed tomography confirmed decreased aortomesenteric distance and tubography confirmed gastric and proximal duodenum distension above the compressed part. INTERVENTIONS: We performed jejunal tube insertion and the amount of feeding through the jejunal tube was gradually increased while maintaining parenteral nutrition. OUTCOMES: The presenting symptoms of the patient gradually improved. Follow-up abdomen computed tomography and tubography showed improvement in duodenal narrowing and stomach distension.

Chronoamperometric detection of nitrite at the Au/CNHN/GCE achieved a lower linear calibration range of 0.05 to 1.15 mM, with an LOD of 0.017 M compared with previous reports. The proposed method obtained satisfactory recoveries for nitrite determination in practical applications, which was verified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The prepared sensor based on Au/CNHN featured favorable selectivity and stability, which provides a promising approach for real sample analysis.

Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should be included in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients in order to improve both short- and long-term prognosis. In Covid patients the choice of route of administration for nutrition is closely related to respiratory autonomy. In subjects who are not mechanically ventilated or with non-invasive ventilation (NIV), spontaneous oral feeding is strongly indicated, while considering the patient's comorbidity, chewing ability and swallowing. If this is not possible or if it is not possible to meet the appropriate nutritional needs, it is necessary to resort to artificial nutrition (enteral or parenteral). Enteral nutrition (EN) is preferred to parenteral nutrition (PN) because it allows to maintain the trophism of the gastrointestinal tract, involving a lower risk of infectious complications and it is easier to manage. PN is usually used in patients in whom NE is not feasible, insufficient or contraindicated, or in patients with invasive total mechanical ventilation. Based on these considerations, it would be necessary to develop a targeted nutritional pathway in order to support the management of Covid patients. In the nutritional management of these patients, the role of the hospital pharmacists is fundamental. They collaborate with clinicians, nutritionist, dieticians and speech therapists to choose the most appropriate nutrition, based on the clinical characteristics of the patient and on the availability of nutritional formulations in the therapeutic guide.","output":"Clinical nutrition and the role of hospital pharmacist in the management of covid patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments over two centuries have repeatedly confronted whether freer trade helps or hinders the problem of widespread food shortages.

Moreover, autophagy was confirmed to benefit PEDV replication by using autophagy regulators and RNA interference. Furthermore, autophagy might be associated with the expression of inflammatory cytokines and have a positive feedback loop with the NF-B signaling pathway during PEDV infection.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 correlates with the severity of psychopathological symptoms as measured by standardized questionnaires. The questionnaires were obtained using the Computer Assisted Web Interviews (CAWI) method during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland using the original COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). A series of bivariate tests and linear regression analyses were performed with a p < 0.05. All analyses were performed in Statistica 13.3. We enrolled 1,002 respondents. The rate of correct answers in the original questionnaire ranged from 44.6 to 84.1%, and the average was 60.1%. Four hundred and twenty participants (42%) met the criterion for the presence of relevant psychopathological symptoms. A significant negative correlation was found between the number of points obtained in the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire and the GHQ-28 scores, both in relation to the total score and all its subscales. The following factors in the linear regression model were correlated with severity of somatic symptoms: knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic (B = ?0.12, P = 0.000), sex (B = 0.12, P = 0.000), use of psychiatric or psychological care (B = 0.20, P < 0.000) and chronic diseases (B = 0.09, P = 0.002). In this study, we observed a negative correlation between the knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and the severity of psychopathological symptoms.

Robust Poisson regression was used to relate sex and age to each of the six outcomes and find adjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios. Also, binomial regression models were performed for those outcomes that had significant results to generate probability plots to perform a fine analysis of the results obtained along age as a continuous variable. RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence analysis revealed that that there was an 87.9% higher probability of developing COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with diabetic nephropathy, a 5% higher probability of being admitted, a 101.7% higher probability of intubation and a 20.8% higher probability of a fatal outcome due to COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison to CKD patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetic nephropathy had nearly a twofold rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, a higher probability of admission, a twofold probability of intubation and a higher chance of death once admitted compared to patients with chronic kidney disease alone.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and Cochrane Library for articles published between January 1, 2020, and April 13, 2020. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of the COVID-19 deceased with meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2401 patients in 15 articles were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that 66.6% of COVID-19 deceased were male, with a median age of 69.9 years. Common symptoms of deceased included fever (70.6C100%), dyspnea (38.89C85.7%), cough (22.4C78%), and fatigue (22C61.9%). The incidence of hypertension, chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic cerebrovascular disease among the COVID-19 deceased were 38.56% (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.84 ~ 52.12%), 17.54% (95% CI 13.38 ~ 21.69%), 22.2% (95% CI 19.30 ~ 25.10%), and 15.58% (95% CI 10.05 ~ 21.12%), respectively.

Materials and Methods: Patients starting their first IVF cycle at our institution between 8/13/2019 - 12/31/2020 were recruited. Exclusions included previous IVF treatment, use of donor gametes/embryos, and non-English speakers. Enrolled participants completed baseline surveys (FertiQoL, PHQ-9, GAD-7, the 2-index Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, and an IVF knowledge survey). Participants were assigned to groups of 5-8 couples by projected oocyte retrieval date. Randomization to control (standard of care (SOC)) or intervention (CALM IVF + SOC) was done at the group level. CALM IVF participants attended 3 one-hour PG sessions prior to oocyte retrieval. 3 days after retrieval, all participants repeated surveys. Participants were followed for 3 months after retrieval to determine outcome and return to care. We estimated needing a sample size of 40 to show a 13.5 point difference in FertiQoL scores with 82.5% power and =0.05. Analyses were performed using Students t-tests or Fischers exact tests as appropriate. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed for overall group differences as well as for differences in outcomes for those participating during the COVID-19 pandemic (after IVF clinical operations were paused on 3/16/20). Results: 76 couples enrolled. Due to drop-out, 20 females and 11 males participated in CALM IVF, and 20 females and 13 males in the control group. Those randomized to CALM IVF were more likely to experience a cancelled oocyte retrieval or poor embryo development in comparison to control (26% vs 13%). Males had significantly higher total QoL (6.68 [0.39 C 12.98], p=0.039), treatment QoL (8.26 [0.69 C 15.82], p=0.034), and resilience (1.13 [0.54 C 1.72], p=0.001) change in scores from pre-treatment to post-treatment after participating in CALM IVF versus control. Prior to COVID clinical pause, knowledge scores in the CALM IVF group significantly increased compared with control (13.19 [3.53 C 22.84], p=0.011). CALM IVF groups spanning 3/16/2020 and those recruited after had a significant improvement in the social subscale score (11.67 [-0.54 C 22.79], p=0.042 and 10.42 [1.79 C 19.04], p=0.023, respectively). Rates of ongoing pregnancy and return to care were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions: QoL and resilience are improved in males participating in CALM IVF during their first IVF cycle. Prior to COVID-19 shutdowns, CALM IVF improved IVF knowledge scores in participants. In participants who underwent treatment after COVID-19 shutdowns, CALM IVF improved social QoL scores. Impact Statement: Male partners of the IVF dyad may receive significant fertility related QoL and resilience benefits from a PG intervention.

We interviewed suppliers and workers of the Municipal Secretariat of Education and distributed a survey to professionals and beneficiaries. Results: One of the findings was that federal procurement regulations for the acquisition of food for public schools led to difficult choices for school officials during this period. These regulations determined that at least 30% of the budget must be used in local purchases from smallholder family farmers. However, almost all products generated by family farming in the region of Vitria are perishable and require distribution and consumption on the same day, which represents a challenge for the logistic process of assembling and distributing food kits.

Corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the pathological findings seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are very similar to those observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. However, the long-term use of corticosteroids (especially at high doses) is associated with potentially serious adverse events, particularly steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH). In todays global outbreak, whether corticosteroid therapy should be used, the dosage and duration of treatment, and ways for the prevention, early detection, and timely intervention of SANFH are some important issues that need to be addressed. This review aims to provide a reference for health care providers in COVID-19 endemic countries and regions. ARTICLE FOCUS: Hormones are a double-edged sword. This review aims to provide a reference for health care providers in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) endemic countries and regions, especially with respect to the pros and cons of corticosteroid use in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: In todays global outbreak, whether corticosteroid therapy should be used, the dosage and duration of treatment, and ways for the prevention, early detection, and timely intervention of SANFH are some important issues that need to be addressed. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Since SARS was mainly prevalent in China at that time, many evidences in this paper came from the reports of Chinese scholars. There is a bias in the selection of data, which may ignore the differences in environment, race, living habits, medical level and so on. SANFH may be the result of multiple factors. Whether the virus itself is an independent risk factor for SANFH has not been confirmed. In this paper, through literature retrieval, some reference opinions on glucocorticoid usage, diagnosis and treatment of SANFH are given. However, due to the lack of large-scale research data support, it can not be used as the gold standard for the above problems.","output":"Beware of Steroid-Induced Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head in the Treatment of COVID-19Experience and Lessons from the SARS Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019, 64 candidate vaccines are in clinical development and 173 are in the pre-clinical phase.

Safety evaluation of NRC-VACC-01 inactivated candidate vaccine in rats revealed that the vaccine was highly tolerable. By studying the effect of booster dose in the immunological profile of vaccinated mice, we observed an increase in neutralizing antibody titers after the booster shot, thus a booster dose was highly recommended after week three or four.

DESIGN: A follow-up online survey. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Among the 1,600 baseline online survey participants, 388 adults were already frail, and 275 older adults did not respond to the follow-up survey. Thus, the final number of participants in this study was 937 (follow-up rate: 77.3%). METHODS: We assessed the total PA time at four time points according to the COVID-19 waves in Japan: January 2020 (before the pandemic), April 2020 (during the first wave), August 2020 (during the second wave), and January 2021 (during the third wave). We then investigated the incidence of frailty during a one-year follow-up period (during the pandemic). RESULTS: The total PA time during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic decreased from the pre-pandemic PA time by 33.3%, 28.3%, and 40.0%, respectively. In particular, the total PA time of older adults who were living alone and socially inactive decreased significantly: 42.9% (first wave), 50.0% (second wave), and 61.9% (third wave) less than before the pandemic, respectively. Additionally, they were at a significantly higher risk of incident frailty than those who were not living alone and were socially active (adjusted odds ratio: 2.04 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-4.10]). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that older adults who live alone and are socially inactive are more likely to experience incident frailty/disability due to decreased PA during the pandemic.

In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a total of 1 s and a 200-ns enhanced correlation guided MD simulation. We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the assembly process of the CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in long-time enhanced correlation guided MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that CoV-2 RBD does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates because of an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2 so that the activation of CoV-2 RBD might be inhibited in this case.

Recently, macroscopic self-assemblies based on molecular recognition have been realized using millimeter-scale hydrogel pieces possessing molecular recognition moieties. During the study on macroscopic self-assembly based on molecular recognition, we noticed that the shape of assemblies might be dependent on the host-guest pair. In this study, we were thus motivated to study the macroscopic shape of assemblies formed through host-guest interaction. We modified crosslinked poly(sodium acrylate) microparticles, i.e., superabsorbent polymer (SAP) microparticles, with ?-cyclodextrin (?CD) and adamantyl (Ad) residues (?CD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles, respectively, where x and y denote the mol% contents of ?CD and Ad residues). Then, we studied the self-assembly behavior of ?CD(x)-SAP and Ad(y)-SAP microparticles through the complexation of ?CD with Ad residues. There was a threshold of the ?CD content in ?CD(x)-SAP microparticles for assembly formation between x = 22.3 and 26.7. On the other hand, the shape of assemblies was dependent on the Ad content, y; More elongated assemblies were formed at a higher y. This may be because, at a higher y, small clusters formed in an early stage can stick together even upon collisions at a single contact point to form elongated aggregates, whereas, at a smaller y, small clusters stick together only upon collisions at multiple contact points to give rather circular assemblies.

Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with SARS-CoV in vitro. Virus replication was monitored by measuring the levels of positive- and negative-strand RNA, by immunofluorescence detection of the SARS-CoV nucleoprotein, and by titration of the infectious virus. The gene expression profiles of macrophages infected with SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, and influenza A (H1N1) virus were compared by using microarrays and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Secreted cytokines were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SARS-CoV initiated viral gene transcription and protein synthesis in macrophages, but replication was abortive and no infectious virus was produced. In contrast to the case with human coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus, there was little or no induction of beta interferon (IFN-beta) in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages. Furthermore, SARS-CoV induced the expression of chemokines such as CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1. The poor induction of IFN-beta, a key component of innate immunity, and the ability of the virus to induce chemokines could explain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS.","output":"Cytokine responses in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected macrophages in vitro: possible relevance to pathogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore trends in the burden from stroke associated with home quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to explore safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV. METHODS: In this single-arm open-label vaccination substudy within the protocol of the larger phase 2/3 trial COV002, adults aged 18C55 years with HIV were enrolled at two HIV clinics in London, UK. Eligible participants were required to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with undetectable plasma HIV viral loads (<50 copies per mL), and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per L. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4C6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN- enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination. Outcomes were analysed in all participants who received both doses and with available samples. The COV002 study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 5 and Nov 24, 2020, 54 participants with HIV (all male, median age 425 years [IQR 372C498]) were enrolled and received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Median CD4 count at enrolment was 6940 cells per L (IQR 5735C8595). No serious adverse events occurred. Local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after prime vaccination included pain at the injection site (26 [49%] of 53 participants with available data), fatigue (25 [47%]), headache (25 [47%]), malaise (18 [34%]), chills (12 [23%]), muscle ache (19 [36%]), joint pain (five [9%]), and nausea (four [8%]), the frequencies of which were similar to the HIV-negative participants. Anti-spike IgG responses by ELISA peaked at day 42 (median 1440 ELISA units [EUs; IQR 704C2728]; n=50) and were sustained until day 56 (median 941 EUs [531C1445]; n=49). We found no correlation between the magnitude of the anti-spike IgG response at day 56 and CD4 cell count (p=093) or age (p=048). ELISpot and T-cell proliferative responses peaked at day 14 and 28 after prime dose and were sustained to day 56. Compared with participants without HIV, we found no difference in magnitude or persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral or cellular responses (p>005 for all analyses). INTERPRETATION: In this study of people with HIV, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was safe and immunogenic, supporting vaccination for those well controlled on ART.

Many challenges exist in achieving this goal, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as, employees working remotely and social distancing rules. In prior years we executed fixed-internal point of distribution (POD) vaccination events. Last year we implemented a highly successful fixed-external Drive-Thru POD. Drive-Thru PODs can be safe and effective approaches to employee vaccination during a pandemic. Methods A 90-minute drive-thru Flu POD was accomplished from 7am-8:30am at the main employee Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center entrance. Social distancing, masking was enforced. VA-Police directed traffic at the checkpoint into two lanes; flu shot, and non-flu shot lanes. Employees were directed to drive to one of ten tables each staffed with two nurses; Employees received their vaccination while remaining in their vehicle. Employee safety was of paramount concern; weather conditions, rain date, traffic control, location were all predetermined. Coordinating services included: VA-Police, Emergency Management, VA-Fire Department, Public Affairs, Logistics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Environmental Management, and Information Technology for promoting this event. Results On October 7th 385 employees received the flu vaccine compared to 290 in 2019. The event yielded a rate of 427 doses administered per 100 minutes compared to 322 in 2019, and only 15 per 100 minutes during internal flu POD 2018-19. This well-planned event was convenient, safe, and efficient without unintended consequences. The employees appreciated the ease, accommodation, and safety provided during this event. Conclusions Our drive-thru POD event during COVID-19 was even more successful than the year's prior. Its improved time/vaccine ratio for employee flu vaccine administration and effective project management resulted in a well-organized, streamlined process and higher employee satisfaction. This innovative strategy can be utilized as an emergency-response vaccination plan especially during a pandemic, and the basis for planning a COVID-19 vaccine distribution model.","output":"Influenza Vaccination Challenges for Hospital Employees in the COVID Era: Experience of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the global spread of a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), factors that influence viral diffusion have gained great attention Human-to-human transmission mainly occurs through droplets, but viral RNA clearance in different biological fluids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear We aimed to correlate the presence and the relevant temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in biological specimens (stool, urine, blood, and tears) of the transmission with clinical/epidemiological features in patients with COVID-19 We focused on the time window between the positivity of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from different specimens We used the MantelCCox log rank test to verify the differences in terms of viral shedding duration, while we employed the MannCWhitney U-test for subgroup analysis This review protocol was registered with PROSPERO number: CRD42020183629 We identified 147 studies;we included 55 (1,348 patients) for epidemiological analysis, of which we included 37 (364 patients) for statistical analysis The most frequently used specimens other than respiratory tract swabs were stool samples (or anal/rectal swabs), with a positivity rate of 48 8%, followed by urine samples, with a positivity rate of 16 4%;blood samples showed a positivity rate of 17 5% We found that fecal positivity duration (median 19 days) was significantly (p &lt; 0 001) longer than respiratory tract positivity (median 14 days) Limited data are available about the other specimens In conclusion, medical and social communities must pay close attention to negativization criteria for COVID-19, because patients could have longer alternative viral shedding","output":"Incidence and Persistence of Viral Shedding in COVID-19 Post-acute Patients With Negativized Pharyngeal Swab: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia began in early 2020 which caused changes in the economy to become unstable and the wheels of business were hampered or some even stopped their activities.

These studies traditionally rely on detection of pathogen-specific antibodies in samples derived from venipuncture, an expensive and logistically challenging aspect of serological surveillance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines implemented to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection made collection of venous blood logistically difficult at a time when SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance was urgently needed. Dried blood spots (DBS) have generated interest as an alternative to venous blood for SARS-CoV-2 serological applications due to their stability, low cost, and ease of collection; DBS samples can be self-generated via fingerprick by community members and mailed at ambient temperatures. Here, we detail the development of four DBS-based SARS-CoV-2 serological methods and demonstrate their implementation in a large serological survey of community members from 12 cities in the East Bay region of the San Francisco metropolitan area using at-home DBS collection. We find that DBS perform similarly to plasma/serum in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. In addition, we show that DBS samples can reliably detect antibody responses months postinfection and track antibody kinetics after vaccination. Implementation of DBS enabled collection of valuable serological data from our study population to investigate changes in seroprevalence over an 8-month period. Our work makes a strong argument for the implementation of DBS in serological studies, not just for SARS-CoV-2, but any situation where phlebotomy is inaccessible. IMPORTANCE Estimation of community-level antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 from infection or vaccination is critical to inform public health responses. Traditional studies of antibodies rely on collection of blood via venipuncture, an invasive procedure not amenable to pandemic-related social-distancing measures. Dried blood spots (DBS) are an alternative to venipuncture, since they can be self-collected by study participants at home and do not require refrigeration for shipment or storage. However, DBS-based assays to measure antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 have not been widely utilized. Here, we show that DBS are comparable to blood as a sampling method for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination over time measured using four distinct serological assays. The DBS format enabled antibody surveillance in a longitudinal cohort where study participants self-collected samples, ensuring the participants' safety during an ongoing pandemic. Our work demonstrates that DBS are an excellent sampling method for measuring antibody responses whenever venipuncture is impractical.","output":"Development and Implementation of Dried Blood Spot-Based COVID-19 Serological Assays for Epidemiologic Studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate countries around the world.

However, there is no clear evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be different across SES in Portugal. This work identifies the COVID-19 worst-affected municipalities at four different time points in Portugal measured by prevalence of cases, and seeks to determine if these worst-affected areas are associated with SES. METHODS: The worst-affected areas were defined using the spatial scan statistic for the cumulative number of cases per municipality. The likelihood of being in a worst-affected area was then modelled using logistic regressions, as a function of area-based SES and health services supply. The analyses were repeated at four different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: 1(st) of April, 1(st) of May, 1(st) of June, and 1(st) of July, corresponding to two moments before and during the confinement period and two moments thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty municipalities were identified as worst-affected areas in all four time points, most in the coastal area in the Northern part of the country. The areas of lower unemployment were less likely to be a worst-affected area on the 1(st) of April [AOR = 0.36 (0.14; 0.91)], on the 1(st) of May [AOR = 0.03 (0.00; 0.41)], and on the 1(st) of July [AOR = 0.40 (0.16; 1.05)].

Medical waste treatment scheme selection may have long-term impacts on the economy, society, and environment. Determining the best treatment option is a considerable challenge. To solve this problem, in this paper, we proposed a multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) method based on single-valued neutrosophic numbers and partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (PMSM) operator. Because of the complexity of the medical waste treatment scheme selection problem, the single-valued neutrosophic numbers are applied to express the uncertain evaluation information. For the medical waste treatment scheme selection problem, the factors or criteria (these two terms can be interchanged.) in the same clusters are closely related, and the criteria in different clusters have no relationships. The partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean function can handle these complicated criterion relationships. Therefore, we extend the PMSM operator to process the single-valued neutrosophic numbers and propose the single-valued neutrosophic partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (SVNPMSM) operator and its weighted form (SVNWPMSM). Then, we analyze their properties and give typical examples of the proposed operators.

Methods: One of the major challenges of this disease is the high number of patients needing advanced respiratory support due to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as the lung is the major Calthough not exclusive-target of the virus. The molecular mechanisms, pathogenic drivers and the target cell type(s) in SARSCoV-2 infection are still poorly understood, but the development of a hyperactive immune response is proposed to play a role in the evolution of the disease and it is envisioned as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Results: Here we propose a theory by which the main targets for SARS-CoV-2 are the Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells and the clinical manifestations of the syndrome are a direct consequence of their involvement. We hypotize the existence of a vicious cycle by which once alveolar damage starts in AEC II cells, the inflammatory state is supported by macrophage proinflammatory polarization (M1), cytokines release and by the activation of the NF-B pathway. Conclusions: If this theory is confirmed, future therapeutic efforts can be directed to target Type 2 alveolar cells and the molecular pathogenic drivers associated with their dysfunction with currently available therapeutic strategies.","output":"Alveolar Epithelial Cell Type II as main target of SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 development via NF-Kb pathway deregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No effective treatment for COVID-19 has been well established yet.

Different prediction techniques have been developed to predict the coronavirus diseases existence in patients. However, the accurate prediction was not improved and time consumption was not minimized. In order to address these existing problems, a novel technique called Biserial Targeted Feature Projection-based Radial Kernel Regressive Deep Belief Neural Learning (BTFP-RKRDBNL) is introduced to perform accurate disease prediction with lesser time consumption. The BTFP-RKRDBNL techniques perform disease prediction with the help of different layers such as two visible layers namely input and layer and two hidden layers. Initially, the features and data are collected from the dataset and transmitted to the input layer. The Point Biserial Correlative Target feature projection is used to select relevant features and other irrelevant features are removed with minimizing the disease prediction time. Then the relevant features are sent to the hidden layer 2. Next, Radial Kernel Regression is applied to analyze the training features and testing disease features to identify the disease with higher accuracy and a lesser false positive rate. Experimental analysis is planned to measure the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and prediction time for different numbers of patients. The result illustrates that the method increases the prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by 10, 6, and 21% and reduces the prediction time by 10% as compared to state-of-the-art works.","output":"Biserial targeted feature projection based radial kernel regressive deep belief neural learning for covid-19 prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims to examine access to medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic for people living with disabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the practical and ethical problems of allocating limited medical resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators became critical. Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic shifts the medical paradigm from person-centred medicine to community-centred medicine, challenging the main ethical theories. We reviewed the main guidelines and recommendations for resources allocation and examined their position toward persons with disabilities. Based on our findings, we propose criteria for not discriminating against people with disabilities in allocating resources. The shift from person-centred to community-centred medicine offers opportunities but also risks sacrificing the most vulnerable people.

A replication incompetent adenoviral vector based on human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) has been evaluated in several clinical trials. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and features of recombinant viral vector vaccines. This paper reviews the biological features of the Ad26 vectors, including tabulation of safety and risk assessment characteristics of Ad26 vector-based vaccines. Substantial information on immunogenicity, clinical safety, biological characteristics and manufacturing are reported. In the Ad26 vector, deletion of the E1 gene, rendering the vector replication incompetent and providing space for transgene insertion, is combined with additional genetic engineering for vaccine manufacturability and transgene expression optimization. These vaccines are manufactured using the E1-complementing PER.C6? cell line, a continuous, human cell-line that can be cultured in serum-free medium in a suspension to high cell densities, providing an effective and flexible system for high-yield manufacturing. Ad26 vector vaccines have favorable thermostability profiles, compatible with vaccine supply chains. Safety data are compiled in the Ad26 vaccine safety database version 4.0, with unblinded data from 23 ongoing and completed clinical studies for a total of 3912 participants in Ebola, HIV, Malaria, RSV and Filovirus Ad26-based vaccine programs. Overall, all Ad26-based vaccines have been well tolerated, with no significant safety issues identified from the available data in the current Ad26 vaccine safety database. Evaluation of Ad26-based vaccines to further characterize the safety profile is continuing, with more than 90,000 participants vaccinated as of 1st July 2020 (cut-off date). Extensive evaluation of immunogenicity in humans shows strong and durable humoral and cellular immune responses. Clinical trials have not shown meaningful impact of pre-existing immunity to Ad26 on vaccine immunogenicity, even in the presence of Ad26 neutralizing antibody titers or Ad26-targeting T cell responses at baseline. The first vaccine, against Ebola virus, that makes use of the Ad26 vector, received marketing authorization from EC on 1st July 2020, as part of the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA BN Filo vaccine regimen.

This study was conducted via a web-based survey using quota sampling to ensure representativeness of the Japanese population aged 20-64 years. A cross-sectional study of 11,342 participants (5,734 males and 5,608 females) was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and questions related to the pandemic, SES, and lifestyle. The prevalence of psychological distress, represented by a K6 score of 5 or more, was 50.3% among males and 52.6% among females. Both males and females with annual household incomes less than 2 million yen and males aged in their twenties had significantly higher K6 scores than those with annual household incomes above 2 million yen and males aged over 30 years.

As a result of the pandemic, increased mental health burdens have been recorded in young adults around the world. We sought to understand the association of stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic with symptoms of psychological and emotional distress in young Canadian adults. METHOD: Questionnaire respondents were asked about the extent to which they were personally impacted by COVID-19, and symptoms related to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, and emotional distress. RESULTS: Of 84 respondents, most identified as female (74%; 62/84). Overall, 61% (51/84) reported experiencing symptoms of psychological distress related to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); specifically, 43% (36/84) reported anxiety-related symptoms, 33% (28/84) reported depression-related symptoms, and 6% (5/84) reported PTSD-related symptoms. Individuals with family in settings high risk for COVID-19 infection and individuals who received government aid with a reduction in income were 4.30-fold and 2.80-fold more likely, respectively, to experience symptoms of psychological distress (95% CI 1.31-14.14; p = .013 and 95% CI 1.08-7.25; p = .038, respectively).

We examined whether COVID-19 restrictions had an impact on Chlamydia trachomatis infections compared with 2018 and 2019. Methods: This retrospective nation-wide Danish observational study was performed using monthly incidences of laboratory confirmed chlamydia cases and number of tests, obtained from nation-wide surveillance data. Additionally, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data, and Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports were used to contextualise the behavioural adaptions seen as a result of COVID-19 policies. Testing rates were compared using Poisson regression and test positivity rates were compared using logistic regression. Results: The crude incidence rate (IR) of laboratory confirmed chlamydia infections was reduced to 66.5 per 105 during the first (March-April 2020) lockdown period as compared to 88.3 per 105 in March-April 2018-2019, but the testing rate was also reduced (Rate ratio 0.72 95% CI 0.71-0.73), whereas the odds ratio for a positive test between the two periods was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.00). The period of eased COVID 19 restrictions (May-December 2020) and the second lockdown period (December 2020-March 2021) were characterised by marginally increased crude IRs, while the number of tests performed, and test positivity rates returned very close to the levels seen in 2018-2019. These results were independent of sex, age group, and geographical location. Conclusion: The first Danish COVID-19 lockdown resulted in a reduction in the number of chlamydia tests performed and a consequent reduction in the number of laboratory-identified cases. This period was followed by a return of testing and test positivity close to the level seen in 2018-2019.

RCTs that used the immunomodulatory formula in the ICU were included. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (1166 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. The immunomodulatory formula reduced the duration of ICU stay weighted mean difference [(WMD): -2.97 days; 95%CI: -5.59, -0.35)], mechanical ventilation (WMD = -2.20 days, 95%CI: -4.29, -0.10), sequential organ failure assessment and multiple organ dysfunction scores (Hedge's g: -0.42 U/L; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.11), decreased 8-day overall mortality risk (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.91), and extended the ICU-free days (WMD: 4.06 days, 95% CI: 0.02, 8.09).

Clinical and epidemiologic data were collected from suspected patients with COVID-19 admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 29 to February 21, 2020. RESULTS One hundred and six patients (60 males and 46 females, median age 36 years) were enrolled. Thirty-six patients were ultimately laboratory confirmed. Fifty-three were excluded from the diagnosis of COVID-19. The remaining 17 patients were highly suspected, although their nucleic acid tests were repeatedly negative. The confirmed patients and highly suspected patients had a significantly higher proportion of epidemiologic history than the excluded patients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms or the underlying diseases among the three groups. The confirmed patients had a higher frequency of lymphopenia and eosinopenia than the highly suspected and excluded patients. Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral lung involvement, and ground-glass opacity was more likely observed in the confirmed patients.

We collected patient demographics, comorbidities and outcomes (i.e., admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and death) from medical and laboratory records and compared patients who did or did not live in public and private RCFs. We evaluated factors associated with the risk of in-hospital death with a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In total, 656 patients were hospitalized between March and June 2020, including 303 patients who lived in RCFs and 353 patients who did not. The mean age was 72.9 (standard deviation 18.3) years (range 21 to 106 yr); 349 (53.2%) were female and 118 (18.0%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. The overall mortality rate was 23.8% (156/656), but was higher among patients living in RCFs (36.6% [111/303]) compared with those not living in RCFs (12.7% [45/353]). Increased risk of death was associated with age 80 years and older (hazard ratio [HR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35C4.24), male sex (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.25C2.41), the presence of 4 or more comorbidities (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.18C3.42) and living in an RCF (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.09C2.39). INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Montral, more than one-third of RCF residents hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection died during hospitalization. Policies and practices that prevent future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this setting must be implemented to prevent high mortality in this vulnerable population.","output":"Comparison of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not live in residential care facilities in Montral: a retrospective case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Telemedicine has been rapidly adopted due to COVID-19 In the earliest days, most screenings were performed by primary care/internal medicine consultants;referrals to subspecialists were minimized Now, as the pandemic has evolved over 6 months, secondary telemedicine consultations should be limited, and earlier involvement of appropriate subspecialists should be reconsidered to optimize patient management Case Description: An older individual spoke to an on-call general medical physician with the chief complaint of the acute onset of low back pain after moderately strenuous activity, with severe unilateral radiculopathy The telemedicine physician recommended a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent without any specific recommendations regarding follow-up A few days later, with progression of unilateral pain and numbness, a second telemedicine medical consultation was performed;a Medrol dose pack and muscle relaxant were now recommended, again without any follow-up recommendations Days later, with increased unilateral pain/ near anesthesia in the foot, the patient was seen by a spinal surgeon who found;unilateral SLR positive at 20 degrees, a 0/5 foot drop, loss of the Achilles Response, and decreased pin appreciation in the L5 distribution The patient's emergent lumbar MR showed a large unilateral disc herniation with inferior migration at the appropriate level, warranting surgical consideration Conclusion: Here, we emphasized several points First, telemedicine may be adequate for the initial screening, but further complaints would be better evaluated in person by either a medical or surgical subspecialist;here, both could have recognized the very clear unilateral foot drop Second, the patient should have had a scheduled follow-up in-person consultation Third, appropriate diagnostic studies should have been ordered at the time of the second telemedicine consultation to establish the correct diagnosis and direct treatment","output":"Case report (Precis): Two telemedicine consultants miss foot drop: When to see patients in person"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Considering that patients on dialysis showed a poor outcome during COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and that COVID\\\\19 symptoms in dialysis patients are often mild or absent, each dialysis unit should implement local strategies to early recognize patients affected by COVID\\\\19. However, many available SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 diagnostic tests demonstrated a moderate sensitivity, 70%C80% is probably a reasonable estimate. Consequently, having useful tools for differential diagnosis becomes essential. In this scenario, lung ultrasound (LUS) may have an important role in the evaluation of lung involvement in hemodialysis patients during COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: We present two cases of hemodialysis patients with COVID\\\\19 pneumonia in whom LUS had a central role in the diagnostic process. Ultrasound images of COVID\\\\19 pneumonia show a typical bilateral pattern characterized by multiple or confluent B\\\\lines with spared areas, thickened and irregular pleural line, and rare subpleural consolidations. LUS showed high accuracy in diagnosing COVID\\\\19 pneumonia. FINDINGS: Despite both patients appeared clinically euvolemic and afebrile, they presented with acute diarrhea and oxygen saturation level of 92%C93%. Although clinical manifestations were mild and not specific in both patients, LUS raised suspicion on the possible COVID\\\\19 diagnosis which was confirmed by a positive nasopharyngeal RT\\\\PCR. DISCUSSION: There are many reasons for a patient on dialysis to present shortness of breath, fever, and multiple B\\\\lines at LUS assessment (such as heart failure, fluid overload, vascular access infection, interstitial pneumonia) but the recognition of typical ultrasound patterns of the COVID\\\\19 pneumonia is helpful for differential diagnosis. LUS may have an important role in the screening process of hemodialysis patients during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, especially in oligosymptomatic patients before the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 diagnostic tests, and in those with suspected symptoms and/or known exposure with unexpected negative SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 diagnostic tests.","output":"Lung ultrasound may help in the differential diagnosis of suspected oligosymptomatic COVID\\\\19 patients on hemodialysis: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to encourage teachers from all areas, with a special focus on the area of language teaching, to explore the possibilities of creating virtual learning environments using technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) Through the current work, the authors intend to share with other teachers their experience with the design and implementation of a 360o German-language app created by using Tour Creator The latter is a freely available authoring tool developed by Google and allows stakeholders with no specific computer skills to easily create their own VR tours This way, teachers could provide their students with learning resources that are usually difficult to implement in conventional teaching environments For the purposes of the current project, the authors designed a VR-based app called Cdiz 360o that permits German language learners by means of numerous panoramic views to explore the Spanish city of Cdiz and to interact with its different places and sights, while practicing, at the same time, their listening and reading skills ? 2020 ACM","output":"Virtual reality authoring tools for teachers to create novel and immersive learning scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Women may be especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic. AIMS: This study attempted to assess how gender affects risk perceptions, anxiety levels and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, to recommend gender-responsive health policies. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and questions on their risk perceptions, preventive behaviour and information exposure. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of factors such as age, gender and household income on anxiety levels. RESULTS: Of the 1391 respondents, 478 were women and 913 were men. Women considered their chances of survival to be relatively lower than men (59% v. 73%). They were also more anxious (62% v. 50%) and more likely to adopt precautionary behaviour, such as avoiding going to the hospital (78% v. 71%), not going to work (72% v. 57%) and using disinfectants (93% v. 86%). Men were more likely to trust friends, family and social media as reliable sources of COVID-19 information, whereas women were more likely to trust doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Women experience a disproportionate burden of the psychological and social impact of the pandemic compared with men. Involving doctors in healthcare communication targeting women might prove effective.

From this information, their abundance, size, molar mass, density and anisotropy can be determined. The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined depends in part on the accuracy of the radial position recordings and the boundary conditions used in the modeling of the AUC data. The AUC instrument can spin samples at speeds up to 60,000 rpm, generating forces approaching 300,000 g. Forces of this magnitude will stretch the titanium rotors used in the instrument, shifting the boundary conditions required to solve the flow equations used in the modeling of the AUC data. A second source of error is caused by the chromatic aberration resulting from imperfections in the UV-visible absorption optics. Both errors are larger than the optical resolution of currently available instrumentation. Here, we report software routines that correct these errors, aided by a new calibration disk which can be used in place of the counterbalance to provide a calibration reference for each experiment to verify proper operation of the AUC instrument. We describe laboratory methods and software routines in UltraScan that incorporate calibrations and corrections for the rotor stretch and chromatic aberration in order to support Good Manufacturing Practices for AUC data analysis.","output":"A calibration disk for the correction of radial errors from chromatic aberration and rotor stretch in the Optima AUC? analytical ultracentrifuge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both laboratory investigations and body composition quantification measures (e.g., computed tomography, CT) portray muscle loss in symptomatic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Muscle loss is associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. The exact mechanism of muscle damage in COVID-19 patients, as well as the long-term consequences of muscle injury in disease survivors, are unclear. The current review briefly summarizes the literature for mechanisms, assessment measures, and interventions relevant to skeletal muscle insult in COVID-19 patients. Muscle injury is likely to be attributed to the cytokine storm, disease severity, malnutrition, prolonged physical inactivity during intensive care unit (ICU) stays, mechanical ventilation, and myotoxic drugs (e.g., dexamethasone). It has been assessed by imaging and non-imaging techniques (e.g., CT and electromyography), physical performance tests (e.g., six-minute walk test), anthropometric measures (e.g., calf circumference), and biomarkers of muscle dystrophy (e.g., creatine kinase). Interventions directed toward minimizing muscle loss among COVID-19 patients are lacking. However, limited evidence shows that respiratory rehabilitation improves respiratory function, muscle strength, quality of life, and anxiety symptoms in recovering older COVID-19 patients. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation may restore muscle condition in ICU-admitted patients, albeit empirical evidence is needed. Given the contribution of malnutrition to disease severity and muscle damage, providing proper nutritional management for emaciated patients may be one of the key issues to achieve a better prognosis and prevent the after-effects of the disease.

LECT-2 has positive correlation with the severity of both obesity and insulin resistance. The changes in plasma fetuin-A are not consistent after bariatric surgery and no studies have investigated the changes in LECT-2 on the obese patients with T2D after bariatric surgery. Methods Overall, 18 patients undergoing gastric bypass (GB) and 16 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were enrolled. The fasting plasma fetuin-A and LECT-2 levels were measured at baseline, one week, three months, and one year after surgery. Results Both the GB and SG groups significantly decreased the body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, a body shape index; the triglyceride, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c, C-peptide levels; and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) one year after surgery. The SG group showed a decreasing trend in plasma fetuin-A levels one year after SG surgery. There are no significant changes in LECT-2 one year after either GB or SG.

The regulation of UPR upon HSV-1 infection is complex, and the downstream effectors can be detrimental to viral replication. Therefore, HSV-1 copes with the UPR to create a beneficial environment for its replication. UPR has three branches, including protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). IRE1 is the most conserved branch of UPR which has both RNase and kinase activities. Previous studies have shown that IRE1 RNase activity was inactivated during HSV-1 infection. However, the effect of the two activities of IRE1 on HSV-1 replication remains unknown. Results in this study showed that IRE1 expression was up-regulated during HSV-1 infection. We found that in HEC-1-A cells, increasing RNase activity, or inhibiting kinase activity of IRE1 led to viral suppression, indicating that the kinase activity of IRE1 was beneficial, while the RNase activity was detrimental to viral replication. Further evidence showed that the kinase activity of IRE1 leads to the activation of the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) pathway, which enhances viral replication. Taken together, our evidence suggests that IRE1 is involved in HSV-1 replication, and its RNase and kinase activities play differential roles during viral infection.","output":"Opposite Roles of RNase and Kinase Activities of Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) on HSV-1 Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phishing attacks aim to steal confidential information using sophisticated methods, techniques, and tools such as phishing through content injection, social engineering, online social networks, and mobile applications. To avoid and mitigate the risks of these attacks, several phishing detection approaches were developed, among which deep learning algorithms provided promising results. However, the results and the corresponding lessons learned are fragmented over many different studies and there is a lack of a systematic overview of the use of deep learning algorithms in phishing detection. Hence, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, assess, and synthesize the results on deep learning approaches for phishing detection as reported by the selected scientific publications. We address nine research questions and provide an overview of how deep learning algorithms have been used for phishing detection from several aspects. In total, 43 journal articles were selected from electronic databases to derive the answers for the defined research questions. Our SLR study shows that except for one study, all the provided models applied supervised deep learning algorithms. The widely used data sources were URL-related data, third party information on the website, website content-related data, and email. The most used deep learning algorithms were deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks/long short-term memory networks. DNN and hybrid deep learning algorithms provided the best performance among other deep learning-based algorithms. 72% of the studies did not apply any feature selection algorithm to build the prediction model.

We highlight how gender inequalities intersect with other social determinants of health including ethnicity and economic status to exacerbate situations of marginality. We conclude by offering some practical steps that can be taken to support the discipline to adopt a more critical gender lens to support more equitable research, policy and practice.","output":"Gender and palliative care: a call to arms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fortifying our preparedness to cope with biological threats by identifying and targeting virulence factors may be a preventative strategy for curtailing infectious disease outbreak.

Their management is technically demanding and remains controversial. Hernia complications can be lethal after bariatric surgery (BS). We herein report our experience with concomitant BS and ventral hernia repair (VHR). METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database queried for combined procedures. Hernias were repaired after complete reduction (when the defect was not empty) using a dual mesh fixed to the abdominal wall with absorbable tackers. Data collected included demographics, anthropometrics, co-morbidities, peri-operative course, and intermediate weight loss and co-morbidity status. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 54 patients (34 females, mean body mass index 44.2 kg/m(2)) underwent concomitant BS and VHR. The vast majority of procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies (N = 48; 89 %). Others included laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), open RYGB, and laparoscopic gastric banding (two each). Six patients had complications (11 %): three leaks, two abdominal wall hematomas, and one pulmonary embolism. Hernia recurrence was noted in one patient (1.8 %). Average excess weight loss post-surgery was 49.9  10.3 and 57.7  9.2 % at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The total number of pre-operative co-morbidities was 110. At 12-month follow-up, 50 % (N = 56) were completely resolved and 38 % (N = 42) were improved. CONCLUSION Concomitant BS and VHR is feasible and safe, obviating the need for two separate procedures while not hampering the outcome of either.

Design Prospective Cohort study Setting Public University Hospital (Madrid) Participants and methods 375 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection, admitted to a Public University Hospital (Madrid) between March 1 and March 31, 2020, were included in the Prospective Cohort study. Death was the main outcome. The main variable was disability in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Barthel index. Covariates included sex, age, severity index (Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, qSOFA), polypharmacy (>5 drugs in the month before admission), and comorbidity (3 diseases). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. Estimated model coefficients served to calculate the expected probability of death for a selected combination of five variables: Barthel, sex, age, comorbidities and severity index (qSOFA). Results Mean age was 66 years (SD 15.33), 207 (55%) males. 74 patients died (19.8%). Mortality was associated to low Barthel index (OR per 5-point decrease 1.11; 95CI 1.03-1.20), male sex (0.23, 0.11-0.47), age (1.07, 1.03-1.10) and comorbidity (2.15; 1.08-4.30) but not to qSOFA (1.29, 0.87-1.93) or polypharmacy (1.54; 0.77-3.08).

To determine the causative agent of borreliosis, PCR methods are most widely used, which requires special conditions for organizing the work of laboratories and the use of expensive equipment. In addition, the procedure for isolating bacterial DNA and subsequent amplification takes several hours of working time. At the same time, methods for detecting borrelia in the isothermal LAMP-reaction are described, which makes it possible to significantly speed up the diagnosis, does not require complex equipment and highly qualified personnel. It is also known that LAMP in some cases allows analysis without prior extraction of nucleic acids. The purpose was a development of a modified test for isothermal detection of DNA of borreliosis pathogens for an accelerated result and the possibility of excluding the stage of nucleic acid extraction. We used 40 samples of Borrelia DNA and 11 Ixodes persulcatus ticks. To shorten the detection time for Borrelia, the previously described LAMP method was modified by the introduction of additional loop primers. The copy number of the positive DNA sample of the borrelia plasmid was estimated using digital PCR. The results of the LAMP reaction were compared with those of the commercial PRC-RT test. The additional use of loop primers approximately halved the detection time for Borrelia DNA without affecting the comparative diagnostic efficiency. The analytical sensitivity limit of the modified LAMP method was 4 copies/l or 21 molecules of the plasmid standard added to the reaction. In comparative testing with RT-PCR, the sensitivity of the LAMP method is 90%, and the specificity is 100%. The possibility of detecting borrelia in ticks without the stage of DNA extraction has been demonstrated for the first time.

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the evidence for clinical pathways for LBP and/or radicular leg pain from primary to specialised care and to describe key pathway components. METHODS Electronic database searches (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) from 2006 onwards were conducted with further manual and citation searching. Two independent reviewers conducted eligibility assessment, data extraction and quality appraisal. A narrative synthesis of findings is presented. RESULTS From 18,443 identified studies, 28 papers met inclusion criteria. Pathways were developed primarily to address over-burdened secondary care services in high-income countries and almost universally used interface services with a triage remit at the primary-secondary care boundary. Accordingly, evaluation of healthcare resource use and patient flow predominated, with interface services associated with enhanced service efficiency through decreased wait times and appropriate use of consultant appointments. Low quality study designs, heterogeneous outcomes and insufficient comparative data precluded definitive conclusions regarding clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Pathways demonstrated basic levels of care integration across the primary-secondary care boundary. CONCLUSIONS The limited volume of research evaluating clinical pathways for LBP/radicular leg pain and spanning primary and specialised care predominantly used interface services to ensure appropriate specialised care referrals with associated increased efficiency of care delivery. Pathways demonstrated basic levels of care integration across healthcare boundaries.

In this work, we study the versatility of the thiol-alkyne addition reaction in more depth. Contrary to previous findings with UCHL3, we now show that covalent adduct formation can progress with substituents on the terminal or internal alkyne position. Strikingly, acceptance of alkyne substituents is strictly DUB-specific as this is not conserved among members of the same subfamily. Covalent adduct formation with the catalytic cysteine residue was validated by gel analysis and mass spectrometry of intact ABP-treated USP16CDWT and catalytically inactive mutant USP16CDC205A. Bottom-up mass spectrometric analysis of the covalent adduct with a deuterated propargyl ABP provides mechanistic understanding of the in situ thiol-alkyne reaction, identifying the alkyne rather than an allenic intermediate as the reactive species. Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that introduction of (bulky/electron-donating) methyl substituents on the propargyl moiety decreases the rate of covalent adduct formation, thus providing a rational explanation for the commonly lower level of observed covalent adduct compared to unmodified alkynes. Altogether, our work extends the scope of possible propargyl derivatives in cysteine targeting ABPs from unmodified terminal alkynes to internal and substituted alkynes, which we anticipate will have great value in the development of ABPs with improved selectivity profiles.","output":"Exploring the Versatility of the Covalent Thiol-Alkyne Reaction with Substituted Propargyl Warheads: A Deciding Role for the Cysteine Protease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has infected an estimated 400 million people world-wide, causing approximately 6 million deaths from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The recent emergence of highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV2 has been linked to mutations in Spike. This review provides an overview of the structure and function of Spike and describes the factors that impact Spikes ability to mediate viral infection as well as the potential limits to how good (or bad) Spike protein can become. Proposed here is a framework that considers the processes of Spike-mediated SARS-CoV2 attachment, dissociation, and cell entry where the role of Spike, from the standpoint of the virus, is to maximize cell entry with each viral-cell collision. Key parameters are identified that will be needed to develop models to identify mechanisms that new Spike variants might exploit to enhance viral transmission. In particular, the importance of considering secondary co-receptors for Spike, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans is discussed.

In 2014, the definition of the beginning of active labor changed from 4 centimeters (cm) to 6 cm cervical dilation. More women may have an induction of labor based on results of recent research showing no causal increase in risk of cesarean birth with elective induction of labor for low-risk nulliparous women. Therefore, in-hospital latent phase labor may be longer, increasing the need for nursing support. DESIGN Scoping review of the literature from 2009 to present. METHODS We conducted the review using key words in PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus. Search terms included different combinations of \\"latent or early labor,\\" \\"birth,\\" \\"support,\\" \\"nursing support,\\" \\"obstetrics,\\" and \\"onset of labor.\\" Peer-reviewed research and quality improvement articles from 2009 to present were included if they had specific implications for nursing care during the latent phase of labor.

RESULTS Ten articles were included. Results were synthesized into six categories; support of physiologic labor and birth, the nurse's own personal view of labor, birth environment, techniques and tools, decision-making, and importance of latent labor discussion during the prenatal period. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Support for physiologic labor and birth is an important consideration for use of nonpharmacological methods during latent labor. The nurse's own personal view on labor support can influence the support that laboring women receive.

To consolidate the existing anti-epidemic results and further strengthen the prevention and control measures against the new coronavirus, we are now actively pioneering a novel research idea of regulating the intestinal microbiota through tea polyphenols for reference. Although studies have long revealed the regulatory effect of tea polyphenols on the intestinal microbiota to various gastrointestinal inflammations, little is known about the prevention and intervention of COVID-19. This review summarizes the possible mechanism of the influence of tea polyphenols on COVID-19 mediated by the intestinal microbiota. In this review, the latest studies of tea polyphenols exhibiting their own antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities and protective effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier are combed through and summarized. Among them, (?)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the main monomers of catechins, may be activated as nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The agent inhibits the expression of ACE2 (a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, inhibiting the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, preliminary reasoning and judgments have been made about the possible mechanism of the effect of tea polyphenols on the COVID-19 control and prevention mediated by the microbiota. These results may be of great significance to the future exploration of specialized research in this field.","output":"Tea Polyphenols Prevent and Intervene in COVID-19 through Intestinal Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic that resulted from the spread of SARS-CoV-2 viral infections has affected the population worldwide but has characteristically shown a preponderance for affecting adults.

Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma that usually involves the bowel or pelvis, with isolated cases presenting as acute pancreatitis. We report a case of BL in a 12-year-old male presenting as acute pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice and a right middle cranial fossa mass invading the sphenoid bone. The common bile duct in this case was dilated to 21 mm in diameter on abdominal ultrasound and to 26 mm on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), significantly greater than any value reported in the literature for BL. Given the rapidly progressing nature of BL, we emphasize the importance of recognizing heterogeneous presentations of this disease to improve patient survival. We also conclude that it is important to consider malignancy in a child with acute pancreatitis, particularly in the presence of obstructive jaundice or multisystem involvement. Other Presentations.

To understand the public response to this, Southern Queensland Rural Health commenced a two-phase research project exploring attitudes and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An initial online survey foreshadowed 90 qualitative interviews with respondents to explore what the pandemic meant for everyday life. This paper details use of a qualitative approach by a national collaborative of investigators from 9 rural university departments in Australia who came together to research the qualitative phase of the project. Our methodological approach aligned with extant literature describing the management of large-scale interviewing and coding in the context of unfolding and dynamic contexts. The RITA model (Rapid Identification of Themes from Audio recordings) entails a five-step process designed to progress from identifying research foci, through deductive and iterative coding to identify key concepts. We used a combination of coding templates, organisation and tagging of field notes and real-time sharing through a secure cloud drive to create a data set for immersive analysis and generation of ideas. Use of this method has added to the collective knowledge about successful rapid research investigations, recognising the inherent tension between speed and rigour. This is not a binary but a dialectic;trustworthiness is integral to qualitative research. However, use of fresh approaches is accommodated by new technologies and can preserve adequate rigour while enabling collaboration, research capacity building and increasing the pace of data collection and analysis. This project has presented methodological challenges and highlights some strengths of such an approach. It is hoped that reporting our approach and experiences is useful for the broader health and research community considering large-scale qualitative research.","output":"Australians Experience of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Advantages and Challenges of Scaling Up Qualitative Research Using Large-Scale Rapid Analysis and Building Research Capacity Across Rural Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding among immunocompetent patients is limited.

Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested.

Vaccines are a game-changer by providing a real opportunity to sustainably protect everyone against infection and eliminate the circulation of the virus. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, the three currently authorized in France, overall induce remarkable protection rates of 95 %, 94 % and 70 % respectively.

However, bringing the epidemic under control requires a well-organized mass vaccination campaign. It also requires careful monitoring of many parameters such as the occurrence of adverse events, duration of induced immunity, vaccine efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, interest or not of vaccinating people already infected, vaccination of immunocompromised patients.

Emergency department point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a first-line modality for diagnosis of CAP. The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic creates a unique opportunity to incorporate lung POCUS into the evaluation of a broader range of children. It has increased the utility of lung POCUS in both evaluation and follow-up of pediatric coronavirus cases. An increased use of lung POCUS creates an opportunity for earlier diagnosis while allowing the opportunity for overdiagnosis of small infiltrates and atelectasis. We collated a case series to demonstrate the benefit of lung POCUS in a very broad range of children. METHODS: We collected a case series of 5 patients between December 2018 and December 2019 who presented nonclassically and were diagnosed with CAP on POCUS by a pediatric emergency physician. CONCLUSION: Routine lung POCUS in ill children will allow treating physicians to identify and follow a pulmonary infiltrate consistent with CAP quickly. We anticipate that early and more frequent use of POCUS and earlier diagnosis of CAP may improve outcomes by decreasing healthcare encounters within the same illness and by reducing the incidence of late sequelae of pneumonia such as empyema and effusions. However, we acknowledge that this may come at the expense of the overtreatment of viral infiltrates and atelectasis.

Currently, QTc assessment and monitoring relies largely on 12-lead electrocardiography. As such, we sought to train and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 12-lead ECG algorithm to determine the QTc, and then prospectively test this algorithm on tracings acquired from a mobile ECG (mECG) device in a population enriched for repolarization abnormalities. METHODS: Using >1.6 million 12-lead ECGs from 538 200 patients, a deep neural network (DNN) was derived (patients for training, n = 250 767; patients for testing, n = 107 920) and validated (n = 179 513 patients) to predict the QTc using cardiologist-overread QTc values as the \\"gold standard\\". The ability of this DNN to detect clinically-relevant QTc prolongation (eg, QTc &#8805;500 ms) was then tested prospectively on 686 patients with genetic heart disease (50% with long QT syndrome) with QTc values obtained from both a 12-lead ECG and a prototype mECG device equivalent to the commercially-available AliveCor KardiaMobile 6L. RESULTS: In the validation sample, strong agreement was observed between human over-read and DNN-predicted QTc values (-1.7623.14 ms). Similarly, within the prospective, genetic heart disease-enriched dataset, the difference between DNN-predicted QTc values derived from mECG tracings and those annotated from 12-lead ECGs by a QT expert (-0.4524.73 ms) and a commercial core ECG laboratory [10.5225.64 ms] was nominal. When applied to mECG tracings, the DNN's ability to detect a QTc value &#8805;500 ms yielded an area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.97, 80.0%, and 94.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using smartphone-enabled electrodes, an AI DNN can predict accurately the QTc of a standard 12-lead ECG. QTc estimation from an AI-enabled mECG device may provide a cost-effective means of screening for both acquired and congenital long QT syndrome in a variety of clinical settings where standard 12-lead electrocardiography is not accessible or cost-effective.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Assessment of the Heart Rate Corrected QT Interval Using a Mobile Electrocardiogram Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies have demonstrated that outdoor physical activity positively affects the physical health of young people.

Here we are investigating the quadruplex structures appearing in the genome of the hepatitis B, whose infection is among the ten leading causes of death. Our unique approachthe high-pressure techniqueallowed us to characterize the stability of these quadruplexes in wide temperature and pressure ranges. Pressure experiments gave us the volume changes occurring at the unfolding, e.g., the embedded volume of the folded structure. Volumetric parameters are especially important because the space available for molecules is quite limited in the crowded environment of the cell. We also investigated how the stability of the viral quadruplexes can be increased by the binding of TMPyP4, a special ligand developed for cancer therapy. ABSTRACT: G-quadruplexes are noncanonical structures formed by guanine-rich sequences of the genome. They are found in crucial loci of the human genome, they take part in the regulation of important processes like cell proliferation and cell death. Much less is known about the subjects of this work, the viral G-quadruplexes. We have chosen three potentially G-quadruplex-forming sequences of hepatitis B. We measured the stability and the thermodynamic parameters of these quadruplexes. We also investigated the potential stabilization of these G-quadruplexes by binding a special ligand that was originally developed for cancer therapy. Fluorescence and infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed over wide temperature and pressure ranges. Our experiments indicate the small unfolding volume change of all three oligos. We found a difference between the unfolding of the 2-quartet and the 3-quartet G-quadruplexes. All three G-quadruplexes were stabilized by TMPyP4, which is a cationic porphyrin developed for stabilizing the human telomere.","output":"Pressure Perturbation Studies of Noncanonical Viral Nucleic Acid Structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and has a unique underlying pathogenesis. Hemodialysis (HD) patients experience high risk of contamination with COVID-19 and are considered to have higher mortality rates than the general population by most but not all clinical series. We aim to highlight the peculiarities in the immune state of HD patients, who seem to have both immune-activation and immune-depression affecting their outcome in COVID-19 infection. CASE SUMMARY: We report the opposite clinical outcomes (nearly asymptomatic course vs death) of two diabetic elderly patients infected simultaneously by COVID-19, one being on chronic HD and the other with normal renal function. They were both admitted in our hospital with COVID-19 symptoms and received the same treatment by protocol. The non-HD sibling deteriorated rapidly and was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where he died despite all supportive care. The HD sibling, although considered more high-risk for adverse outcome, followed a benign course and left the hospital alive and well. CONCLUSION: These cases may shed light on aspects of the immune responses to COVID-19 between HD and non-HD patients and stimulate further research in pathophysiology and treatment of this dreadful disease.","output":"Siblings with coronavirus disease 2019 infection and opposite outcomethe hemodialysiss better outcome paradox: Two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We conducted this review to summarize the relation between viral mutation and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and also the severity of COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro. Method: Articles were identified through a literature search until 31 May 2021, in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results: Sixty-three studies were included. To date, most studies showed that the viral mutations, especially the D614G variant, correlate with a higher infectivity than the wild-type virus. However, the evidence of the association between viral mutation and severity of the disease is scant. A SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion was associated with less severe infection in patients. The 11,083G > U mutation was significantly associated with asymptomatic patients. By contrast, ORF1ab 4715L and S protein 614G variants were significantly more frequent in patients from countries where high fatality rates were also reported. The current evidence showed that variants of concern have led to increased infectivity and deteriorating epidemiological situations. However, the relation between this variant and severity of COVID-19 infection was contradictory. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide.

Diagnosis is still challenging and diagnostic delay in non-endemic area is about 3-4 years. The aim of this study was to arrange a clinical and electrophysiological score to select patients with axonal neuropathy that deserve screening for TTR mutation. METHODS: Thirty-five ATTRv patients and 55 patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and electrophysiological findings at first evaluation were collected. Based on significant results between the two groups, a compound (clinical and electrophysiological) score was arranged, and ROC analysis was performed to identify the ideal cut-off able to discriminate between the two groups. RESULTS: ATTRv patients presented a later age at onset, more frequent muscle weakness and carpal tunnel syndrome history. On the other hand, electrophysiological analysis showed that ATTRv patients had lower CMAP and SAP amplitude in all examined nerves. We arranged a compound score constituted by 7 total items, ranging from 0 to 12. ROC analysis showed an Area Under the Curve = 0.8655 and we set the cut-off  5 points to discriminate ATTRv patients with a sensitivity of 96.6% and a specificity of 63.6%. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that our compound score with cut-off  5 allows to discriminate ATTRv patients among subject affected by axonal polyneuropathy with a sensitivity > 95%.

COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1-2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients' length of stay (p = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown. Hospitalization of patients with SAH cannot afford any reductions in facilities, equipment, or personnel if optimum outcomes are desirable.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 on the admissions of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: the West Greece experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents the advantages of the integration of extensive reading of contemporary British literature in the original and the graded texts based on British Literature into EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teaching non-linguist students of the Humanities and Sciences at Perm State University, Russia.

COVID-19 is typically associated with fever and influenza-like symptoms in its early stages. Severe cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI), multiple organ damage, and even death. Until now, there has been a lack of specific and definitive treatment for COVID-19, which further challenges the situation. Previous clinical and laboratory data showed that neutrophils were significantly decreased in patients who died from COVID-19 in the early stages of disease;when patients were admitted to the hospital the number of neutrophils increased dramatically from 7 to 14 days after admission, which is correlated to myocardial and liver injury, thromboembolic complications, and poor prognosis. Autopsy findings revealed abundant neutrophil infiltration in the pulmonary capillaries and exudation into the alveolar cavity. Therefore, we speculate that neutrophils may play an important role in the initiation and progression of COVID-19. In this review, the relationship among the dynamic changes in neutrophils, cytokine storms, and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) with the progression of COVID-19 was elucidated in detail. With a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms this can lead to improved clinical applications which are identified and discussed in this review.","output":"Activated neutrophils in the initiation and progression of COVID-19: hyperinflammation and immunothrombosis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate the contamination status of SARS-CoV-2 in imported frozen seafood from a Russia cargo ship in Qingdao and to analyze the risk factors for infection in local stevedores. Methods: The method of \\"two-stage, full coverage and mixed sampling\\" was used to collect the seafood packaging samples for the nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. A unified questionnaire was designed to investigate 71 stevedores in two shifts through telephone interview. The stevedores were divided into two groups, with 23 in the shit with two infections was group A and 48 in the shift without infection was group B. Software Epi Info7.2 was used to identify the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections in the stevedores. Results: In the frozen seafood from a Russia cargo ship, the total positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in the frozen seafood was 11.53% (106/919). The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in the frozen seafood unloaded by group A (14.29%,70/490) was significantly higher than that in the frozen seafood unloaded by group B (8.39%,36/429)(2=7.79,P=0.01) and the viral loads detected in the frozen seafood unloaded by group A were higher than those detected in the frozen seafood unloaded by group B. The scores of personal protection and behaviors in the stevedores in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P<0.05), and toilet use, smoking and improper hand washing before meals were the risk factors for the infection. Conclusions: The imported frozen seafood was contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 and the contamination distribution was uneven.

The aim of this study was i) to determine the proportion of people with mental stability and volatility during the pandemic in a North West urban environment sample and ii) to establish group differences in psychosocial variables. Mental stability and volatility refer to the extent to which individuals reported change in levels of common mental health symptoms over the course of 12 weeks. Method : a two-wave-online survey (N = 163) was used to explore the psychological and social impact of the pandemic on relatively disadvantaged neighbourhoods within the Liverpool City Region over 12 weeks. Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc tests were used to determine how people with mental stability and volatility differed on factors categorised within an ecological framework of resilience (individual, community, societal, and COVID-19 specific). Results : Individuals categorised as stable in terms of mental health symptoms (63.6%) had better mental and physical health; were more tolerant of uncertainty; reported higher levels of resilience and wellbeing compared to very volatile people (19.8%). These individuals also reported feeling less socially isolated, experienced a greater sense of belonging to their community which was more likely to fulfil their needs, and were more likely to have access to green space nearby for their recommended daily exercise. Stable individuals did not report worrying any more during the pandemic than usual and tolerated uncertainty better compared to those in the volatile group. Implications : The majority of participants in this sample were mentally stable and coping well with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The resilience of these individuals was related to key place-based factors such as a strong sense of community and useable local assets. The data showcase the role of place-based social determinants in supporting resilience and thereby highlight key preventative measures for public mental health during times of international crisis.","output":"Characteristics of mental health stability during COVID-19: An online survey with people residing in the Liverpool City Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SYNOPSIS Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) negatively impacts several organs and systems weeks or months after initial diagnosis, a condition defined as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 or long COVID.

There is a critical global need for therapeutic intervention strategies that can be deployed to safely treat COVID-19 disease and reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Increasing evidence shows that both natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also referred to as Host Defense Proteins/Peptides (HDPs), can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for the potential clinical use of these molecules as therapeutic options.

These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is likely to be a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity.

Larger droplets tend to fall faster and are less prone to drive the airborne transmission pathway. Alternatively, small droplets (aerosols) can remain suspended for long time periods. The small size of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to be encapsulated in these aerosols, thereby increasing the pathogens ability to be transmitted via airborne paths. Droplet formation during human respiratory events relates to airspeed (speech, cough, sneeze), fluid properties of the saliva/mucus, and the fluid content itself. In this work, we study the fluidic drivers (fluid properties and content) and their influence on factors relating to transmissibility. We explore the relationship between saliva fluid properties and droplet airborne transmission paths. Interestingly, the natural human response appears to potentially work with these drivers to mitigate pathogen transmission. In this work, the saliva is varied using two approaches: (1) modifying the saliva with colloids that increase the viscosity/surface tension, and (2) stimulating the saliva content to increased/decreased levels. Through modern experimental and numerical flow diagnostic methods, the character, content, and exposure to droplets and aerosols are all evaluated. The results indicate that altering the saliva properties can significantly impact the droplet size distribution, the formation of aerosols, the trajectory of the bulk of the droplet plume, and the exposure (or transmissibility) to droplets. High-fidelity numerical methods used and verify that increased droplet size character enhances droplet fallout. In the context of natural saliva response, we find previous studies indicating natural human responses of increased saliva viscosity from stress and reduced saliva content from either stress or illness. These responses both favorably correspond to reduced transmissibility. Such a finding also relates to potential control methods, hence, we compared results to a surgical mask. In general, we find that saliva alteration can produce fewer and larger droplets with less content and aerosols. Such results indicate a novel approach to alter SARS-CoV-2s transmission path and may act as a way to control the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as influenza and the common cold.","output":"Effect of saliva fluid properties on pathogen transmissibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.

Neoliberalism has occasioned a wide-ranging reconstitution of profit accumulation, politics, society, and the individual citizen not least as part of the construction of a new collective common sense. The contention of this paper is that Moroccan language policy/politics is articulated amidst this neoliberal capture. It unfolds in a discursive and institutional environment characterized by uneven, dispersed but dense topographies of neoliberalization, in turn carved up by the political rationalities of state-sanctioned capital accumulation, reproduction and governmentality. While tokenistically congenial to linguistic pluralism, the Moroccan language regime espouses a marked neoliberal reconfiguration of language and multilingualism. The Moroccan language regime appears to have congealed into a neoliberal linguistic consensus predicated on neoliberal multilingualism, a stratified matrix of linguistic differentiation informed by the ideologies and structures of neoliberal political economy and practices of power. Embedded in this regime is linguistic governmentality, the linguistically sanctioned nurturing of neoliberal subjectivity couched within the coordinates of performativity and the neoliberal discursive assortments of human capital, the knowledge economy, employability and lifelong learning. This paper attempts to sketch the lineaments of this evolving linguistic regime with a view to rendering visible the spaces of interplay between neoliberal governance and language politics. The paper concludes with a reflection on the implications for the analysis of potential permutations of neoliberalism under Covid-19.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study recruiting a purposive sample of family members of adult intensive care unit patients experiencing virtual visiting during Jan to May 2021 of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used semi-structured qualitative interviews and a standard Thematic Analysis approach. RESULTS: We recruited 41 family-member participants from 16 hospitals in the United Kingdom. Facilitators to successful virtual visit set-up were preparation of the family, negotiating a preferred time, and easy-to-use technology. Facilitators to successful conduct were intensive care unit team member presence; enabling family involvement in care; inclusivity, accessibility, and flexibility; and having a sense of control. Barriers that created distress or conflict included restrictive virtual visiting practices; raising expectations then failing to meet them; lack of virtual visit pre-planning; and failing to prepare the patient. Barriers to visit conduct were incorrect camera positioning, insufficient technical and staff resources, issues with three-way connectivity, and lack of call closure. Recommendations included emotional self-preparation, increased technology availability, and preparing conversation topics. CONCLUSION: These data may guide virtual visiting practices during the ongoing pandemic but also to continue virtual visiting outside of pandemic conditions. This will benefit family members suffering from ill health, living at a distance, unable to afford travel, and those with work and care commitments, thereby reducing inequities of access and promoting family-centered care.","output":"Family perspectives on facilitators and barriers to the set up and conduct of virtual visiting in intensive care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper the application of numerical and physical models for the simulation of airborne pollutants in urban areas are presented.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate HIV care coverage among HIV-positive adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) living in six South African districts, compare coverage by age and socioeconomic status (SES), and investigate other associated factors including participation in a combination HIV prevention intervention. METHODS: The HERStory Study was an evaluation of the combination intervention, comprising a representative household survey of AGYW aged 15 - 24 years living in six intervention districts. From September 2017 to November 2018, biological, sociodemographic and behavioural data were collected. HIV-positive status, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression were determined through laboratory tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibodies, antiretroviral (ARV) metabolites and viral load (VL) testing). Viral suppression was defined as a VL <1 000 copies/mL. Knowledge of HIV-positive status was self-reported, and participants testing positive for ARV metabolites were assumed to have known their HIV-positive status. Unconditional HIV care cascades were created, stratified by age and SES. We used Pearson's 2 tests corrected for survey-based analysis to describe factors associated with knowledge of HIV status, and being on ART. RESULTS: Of the 4 399 participants, 568 were HIV-positive (12.4%), of whom 60.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 57.1 - 64.5) knew their status, 50.6% (95% CI 46.6 - 54.0) were on ART, and 62.1% (95% CI 58.4 - 65.9) were virally suppressed. Most participants (84.9%) were in the lower SES group, and they had better coverage than the higher SES group: 61.9% (95% CI 58.3 - 65.4) knew their status, 52.1% (95% CI 48.4 - 55.9) were on ART, and 64.9% (95% CI 61.3 - 68.4) were virally suppressed, compared with 55.0% (95% CI 42.1 - 68.0), 40.0% (95% CI 29.2 - 50.8), and 46.6% (95% CI 34.5 - 58.7), respectively. Participants aged 15 - 19 years had slightly inferior coverage to the 20 - 24-year-old group: 57.5% knew their status, 46.1% were on ART and 59.5% were virally suppressed, compared with 62.3%, 52.2% and 63.3%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasise the need to close the gaps in HIV care coverage among AGYW, of whom only 61% knew their HIV-positive status and only 62% were virally suppressed. There is pro-poor inequality in HIV care coverage, with those in lower socioeconomic groups more likely to be virally suppressed.","output":"HIV care coverage among HIV-positive adolescent girls and young women in South Africa: Results from the HERStory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic became a major risk in global public health.

Methods: 63 Bigs (age 50+) and 53 Minis (age 18+) completed the survey. Stress compared to before COVID-19, social isolation, life satisfaction, intergenerational solidarity, and satisfaction with the program were measured for both the Big and Mini participants. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, group comparison and conventional content analyses were conducted. Results: Results showed that 38.1% of Bigs and 37.7% of Minis felt higher levels of stress than before COVID-19. Both Bigs and Minis had medium levels of social isolation. They also reported high levels of satisfaction with life, satisfaction with the program, and intergenerational solidarity.

Recent advances in 3D printing have facilitated fabrication of vascular scaffolds, contributing to broad prospects for tissue vascularization. This review presents state of the art on modeling methods, print materials and preparation processes for fabrication of vascular scaffolds, and discusses the advantages and application fields of each method. Specially, significance and importance of scaffold-based tissue engineering for vascular regeneration are emphasized. Print materials and preparation processes are discussed in detail. And a focus is placed on preparation processes based on 3D printing technologies and traditional manufacturing technologies including casting, electrospinning, and Lego-like construction. And related studies are exemplified. Transformation of vascular scaffolds to clinical application is discussed. Also, four trends of 3D printing of tissue engineering vascular scaffolds are presented, including machine learning, near-infrared photopolymerization, 4D printing, and combination of self-assembly and 3D printing-based methods.","output":"3D printing of tissue engineering scaffolds: a focus on vascular regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition (RAASi) is a cornerstone in the treatment of children with CKD, it is sometimes discontinued when kidney function declines. We studied the reasons of RAASi discontinuation and associations between RAASi discontinuation and important risk markers of CKD progression and on eGFR decline in the Cardiovascular Comorbidity in Children with CKD study. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS In this study, 69 children with CKD (67% male, mean age 13.7 years, mean eGFR 27 ml/min per 1.73 m2) who discontinued RAASi during prospective follow-up were included. Initial change in BP, albuminuria, and potassium after discontinuation were assessed (median time 6 months). Rate of eGFR decline (eGFR slope) during a median of 1.9 years before and 1.2 years after discontinuation were estimated using linear mixed effects modeling. RESULTS Physician-reported reasons for RAASi discontinuation were increase in serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, and symptomatic hypotension. After discontinuation of RAASi, BP and albuminuria increased, whereas potassium decreased. eGFR declined more rapidly after discontinuation of RAASi (-3.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval, -5.1 to -2.6) compared with the slope during RAASi treatment (-1.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval, -2.4 to -0.6; P=0.005). In contrast, no change in eGFR slope was observed in a matched control cohort of patients in whom RAASi was continued.

However, a small proportion of patients develop severe COVID-19 with pathological immune responses. This indicates that a strong immune system balanced with anti-inflammatory mechanisms is critical for the recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Many vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have now been developed for eliciting effective immune responses to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infections or reduce the severity of the disease if infected. Although uncommon, serious morbidity and mortality have resulted from both COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions and lack of efficacy, and further improvement of efficacy and prevention of adverse effects are urgently warranted. Many factors could affect efficacy of these vaccines to achieve optimal immune responses. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota (gut dysbiosis) could be an important risk factor as the gut microbiota is associated with the development and maintenance of an effective immune system response. In this narrative review, we discuss the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, how COVID-19 vaccines elicit protective immune responses, gut dysbiosis involvement in inefficacy and adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and the modulation of the gut microbiota by functional foods to improve COVID-19 vaccine immunisations.","output":"The intestinal microbiota and improving the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have shown that the predictive value of clinical diagnoses of influenza and other respiratory viral infections is low, especially in children.

OBJECT To report our single Institution experience with sacral DAVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients admitted from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2016 with a diagnosis of sacral DAVFs, treated by endovascular embolisation or surgical clipping. Clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, treatment results and follow-up were analysed. RESULTS We identify 13 patients with sacral DAVFs supplied by lateral sacral arteries. Clinical presentation was characterised by different degrees of motor weakness and sphincter disturbances. In all patients, spinal MRI showed spinal cord hyperintensities with enhancement and prominent perimedullary vessels. Selective internal iliac angiography was mandatory to identify the exact location of the fistula. A complete embolisation was achieved in eight patients performing a single endovascular embolisation and in three patients performing a single surgical disconnection: two patients required combined procedures. Follow-up imaging showed a complete resolution of the spinal cord hyperintensities in 81% of patients and a reduction of the intramedullary enhancement in 91%. Gait improvement was observed in 73% of patients, while remaining stable in 27%. Sphincter disturbances improved in 36% of patients and remained stable in 64%. CONCLUSION Awareness of sacral location of DAVFs is critical because standard spinal angiography will not identify sacral supplies, unless internal iliac arteries are properly examined. In our experience, the endovascular treatment show results comparable to surgery when the fistula point is correctly disconnected.","output":"Sacral dural arteriovenous fistulas: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge - single-centre experience of 13 cases and review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare monitoring system in hospitals and other health institutes has increased significantly.

Due to the significant differences between X-ray images of an infected and non-infected person, artificial intelligence techniques can be used to identify the presence and severity of the infection. We propose a classification model that can analyze the chest X-rays and help in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Our methodology classifies the chest X-rays into four classes viz. normal, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. Further, the X-rays indicating COVID-19 are classified on a severity-basis into mild, medium, and severe. The deep learning model used for the classification of pneumonia, TB, and normal is VGG-16 with a test accuracy of 95.9 %. For the segregation of normal pneumonia and COVID-19, the DenseNet-161 was used with a test accuracy of 98.9 %, whereas the ResNet-18 worked best for severity classification achieving a test accuracy up to 76 %.

Study 2 aimed to estimate prevalence in a nationally relevant sample to target interventions. Methods: Study 1: National longitudinal COVID-19 survey from April-November 2020. Testing barriers were included in the June survey (n=1369). Open responses were coded using the COM-B framework (capability-opportunity-motivation). Study 2: Barriers from Study 1 were presented to a new nationally representative sample in November to estimate prevalence (n=2869). Barrier prevalence was analysed by health literacy level using Chi square tests. Results: Study 1: 49% strongly agreed to get tested for symptoms, and 69% would self-isolate. Concern about pain was the top barrier from a provided list (11%), but 32 additional barriers were identified from open responses and coded to the COM-B framework. Study 2: The most prevalent barriers were motivation issues (e.g. don't believe symptoms are COVID-19: 28%, few local cases: 18%). Capability issues were also common (e.g. not sure symptoms are bad enough: 19%, not sure whether symptoms need testing: 15%). Many barriers were more prevalent amongst people with low compared to high health literacy, including motivation (preference to self isolate: 21% vs 12%, pain: 15% vs 9%) and capability (not sure symptom needs testing: 12% vs 8%, not sure how to test:11% vs 4%).

In March 2020, global social distancing measures related to COVID-19 prompted the AR games developer Niantic to implement several changes to ensure continued player engagement with PGO and HPWU. We sought to examine how physical and mental well-being of PGO and HPWU players were affected during the unprecedented COVID-19 restriction period, as well as how video game engagement was affected. OBJECTIVE: (1) To examine the impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on the physical and mental well-being of AR game players; (2) to examine the impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on usage of video games and motivations for use; and (3) to explore the potential role of AR games (and video games in general) in supporting well-being during COVID-19 social restrictions. METHODS: A mixed-method, online, self-reported survey was conducted in May 2020, during which COVID-19 social restrictions were enforced in many countries. Participants were recruited online via four subreddit forums dedicated to PGO or HPWU. Data collected contained quantitative data on demographics, time spent playing video games, physical activity, and mental health, as well as qualitative data on motivations to play and video game impact on mental health during COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS: We report results for 2,004 participants (58.8% male, average age=30.5 years). Self-reported physical activity during COVID-19 social restrictions significantly decreased from 7.50 hours per week on average (SD=11.12) to 6.50 (SD=7.81) (p<.001). Over half of the participants reported poor mental health (n=925/1766, 52.4%; WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5<13)). Being female, younger age, and reduced exercise were significant predictors of poor mental health. Participants reported a significant increase in video game play from 16.38 hours per week on average (SD=19.12) to 20.82 (SD=17.49) (p<.001). Three in four participants (n=1102/1427, 77.2%) reported that playing video games had been beneficial to their mental health. The changes made to PGO and HPWU were very well received by players, and players continued to use these games while exercising and to maintain social connection. In addition to providing an escape during the pandemic and as a form of entertainment, participants reported that they also used video games for emotional coping, to lower stress, relax, and alleviate mental health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: AR games have the potential to promote physical and mental-health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used by populations under isolation and distress, such games can potentially improve physical and mental health by providing virtual socialization, sustained exercise, temporal routine, and mental structure. Further research is needed to explore the potential of AR games as digital behavioral interventions to maintain human wellbeing in the wider population.","output":"COVID-19 as 'Game changer': Use and impact of augmented reality games on physical activity and mental well-being during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by substantial heterogeneity in clinical, biochemical, and physiological characteristics. However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood.

The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. METHODS: We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. FINDINGS: We identified two distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-associated ARDS, with substantial differences in biochemical profiles despite minimal differences in respiratory dynamics. The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 266%) demonstrated increased markers of coagulopathy, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). The odds of 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (400% vs. 233%, OR = 22, 95% CI [12, 39]). INTERPRETATION: We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with short-term mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 131 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a single center of the internal medicine department in Marseille, France. We recorded anthropometric and metabolic parameters such as fasting glycaemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, lipids, and all clinical criteria linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the admission. Excess body weight was defined by a BMIa?&#8805;a?25a?kg/m2. The occurrence of a serious event was defined as a high-debit oxygen requirement over 6a?L/min, admission into the intensive care unit, or death. RESULTS: Among 113 patients, two thirds (na?=a?76, 67%) had an excess body weight. The number of serious events was significantly higher in excess body weight patients compared to normal weight patients (respectively 25% vs 8%, pa?=a?0.03) although excess body weight patients were younger (respectively 63.6 vs 70.3a?years old, pa?=a?0.01).

In a previous study that we published from Leumit Health Services (LHS) including 183 patients with diabetes, pre-COVID-19 infection HbA1c>9% was associated with the need for hospitalization during the disease. In the current study we present the clinical characteristics of patients who died from COVID-19 in LHS and demonstrate a significant link to pre-infection HbA1c. METHODS We collected demographic, clinical and laboratory information regarding all patients insured in LHS who contracted COVID-19 between 1st February and 31st May 2020 and had diabetes or pre-diabetes. To better understand the contribution of pre-infection glycemic control on COVID-19 mortality we conducted a case control study at a 1:5 ratio between patients who had died and survivors, adjusting for age, sex and socioeconomic status. RESULTS We identified 888 patients of whom 24 (2.7%) died from COVID-19 . Patients who died were older, had more chronic disease, higher HbA1c and creatinine and lower hemoglobin, iron and vitamins B12 and D. In the case control study, patients who died had more obesity, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and fewer smokers. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis we found that HbA1c and prior cerebrovascular disease significantly increased the risk of death and normal levels of vitamin D, iron and an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60ml/min were associated with a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS Pre- COVID-19 HbA1c levels and prior cerebrovascular disease are associated with an increased risk of mortality.

Patients received 100 cGy to total lungs in a single fraction. Primary outcome was radiological response using severity and extension score on baseline CT, at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT. Secondary outcomes were toxicity using CTCAE v5, duration of hospitalization, blood work evolution and oxygen requirements using SatO2/ FiO2 index (SAFI), at day 3 and 7 after LD-RT . RESULTS: Nine patients were included. Median age was 66 (IQR 57-77). Severity score was stable or decreased in the third CT but no statistically significant (p=0.28), however, there were statistically significant changes in the extension score (p=0.03).

The downside of this technique may be an increased risk of bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity from the external milieu. The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the peritoneal bacterial contamination in NOSE and non-NOSE laparoscopic colorectal procedures. METHODS Consecutive patients operated for sigmoid diverticulitis with laparoscopic approach and transanal extraction of the specimen from January to December 2010 at our university hospital were enrolled. Patients who underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in the same study period with conventional specimen extraction were used as reference. Peritoneal fluid samples were collected under sterile conditions at the end of the procedure and sent for gram stain as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and fungal cultures. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis with transanal NOSE, while 9 patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with conventional specimen extraction during the same period. The two groups were successfully matched 1:2 (17 NOSE and 9 non-NOSE) according age, sex, ASA, and Charlson comorbidity score. The contamination rate of peritoneal fluid was 100% vs. 88.9% in NOSE and non-NOSE procedures, respectively (P = 0.23). Overall and major complications rates were 27.6% vs. 11.10% (P = 0.41) and 5.08% vs. 11.1% (P = 1) in NOSE vs. non-NOSE procedures, respectively. In the NOSE group there was a statistically significant lower consumption of oral paracetamol (P = 0.007) and of oral tramadol (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Although a higher peritoneal contamination was found in the NOSE procedures, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes relative to standard approach. Avoiding a minilaparotomy to extract the specimen resulted in a significantly lower postoperative analgesic requirement in the NOSE group.","output":"Prospective evaluation of peritoneal fluid contamination following transabdominal vs. transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic left-sided colorectal resections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High developed industry regions, provincial centers with a heavy traffic and dense populations with cold winters, using low-quality fossil fuel consumption have an effect on quality of life especially for people with respiratory diseases.

The experimental material included six populations, i.e. P1, P2, F1, F2, BC1, and BC2 for this wheat cross. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used, and a six parameters model was applied. Additive effects were generally more critical than dominance for all studied traits, except for plant height (PH) and grain yield/plant (GYPP). The duplicate epistasis was observed in spike length; SL, spikes/plant; SPP and days to heading; DTH. All six types of allelic and non-allelic interaction effects controlled SL, GYPP, DTH and glaucousness. All three types of epistasis, i.e. additive x additive, additive x dominance, and dominance x dominance, are essential in determining the inheritance of four traits (SL, GYPP, DTH and glaucousness). Dominance  dominance effects were higher in magnitude than additive  dominance and additive  additive in most traits. The average degree of dominance was minor than unity in six traits (glaucousness, grains/spike, spike weight, days to maturity, 100-grain weight and SL), indicating partial dominance and selection for these traits might be more effective in early generations.

Methods: An online survey study was administered among COVID-19 vaccine recipients in Saudi Arabia. Symptoms post vaccination were assessed in 311 vaccinated participants with two matched doses of either OxfordCAstraZeneca or PfizerCBioNTech vaccines, or two mixed doses, respectively. Results: After the second dose, around 31% of the matched vaccine group reported no symptoms, while only 6% of the mixed vaccine group reported no symptoms.

Given the absence of training data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained with the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to retrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the documents and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good quality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant documents and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split the snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence classification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as input and was trained to predict the likelihood of the candidate sentence being part of the ideal answer. The runs obtained either the best or second best ROUGE-F1 results of all participants to all batches of BioASQ9b.

We found that CB(1)-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB(1) activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB(1)-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB(1)-iLTD. Thus, CB(1)-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.","output":"CB(1)-receptor-mediated inhibitory LTD triggers presynaptic remodeling via protein synthesis and ubiquitination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionFor more than 80 years convalescent or immune sera has been used in severe life threatening infections.

Background The person-centred approach, as defined and developed by Carl Ransom Rogers, remains on the margins of practice in the UK. The approach sustains a non-medical stance. All of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Person Centred Experiential Counselling (APT PCEC) workforce require a qualification in person-centred experiential counselling. In order to attune to Roger's hypothesis regarding the conditions required in order to facilitate psychological growth, person-centred learning is a principle stance. Researching experiences of PCE learning through anonymous feedback from students attending different levels of training (BA, MA and post qualification PCE-Counselling for Depress (CfD) License) is an initial test of the hypothesis . Counselling education in the UK is increasingly highly standardised and driven by competency frameworks. This work begins to uncover person-centred students evaluation of undertaking person-centred qualifications. Modules and continuing professional practice were constructed to facilitate a person-centred learning environment wherein the curriculum was designed by students or the experiential aspect of the learning drove the agenda Method The sample was made up of (N = 30) students. 8 students were studying for a Master's degree in person-centred experiential psychotherapy, 10 students were studying a BA in humanistic psychotherapy, 12 students were attending a mandatory IAPT Continuous Professional Development (CPD) training in PCE therapy. The evaluation responses were subject to a thematic analysis. Result The emerging themes parallel each other and indicate that degree students were very aware of the difference from their previous learning experience in education. 68% of MA Students experienced psychological maturation through the process of training. 83% of BA students became more agentic in their approach to learning. 83% IAPT therapists noticed the nurturing, compassion and humane approach to the learning, despite the mandatory nature of the offer and empowered them in regards to their non-medical stance within an NHS context. Conclusion Our findings point to the significance and impact of person-centred learning for person-centred psychotherapists development during and post-qualification.

The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists' exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged. This will result in a projected net cost savings of $51,451.84 USD per annum. CONCLUSION: Adoption of the TG-CXR technique during the COVID-19 pandemic involved minimal one-time cost, but is projected to result in a net-benefit of over $51,000 USD per annum in our emergency department.","output":"Cost benefit analysis of portable chest radiography through glass: Initial experience at a tertiary care centre during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been responsible since 2019 for the extreme strains put on health and social assistance services across the globe While factors such as the contagiousness of the virus, the lack of immunity in the general population and the uncertain trajectory of the pandemic contribute to the rise of general anxiety among these professionals, the morbidity and mortality attributed to the virus, the scarcity of material and personnel resources are at high risk of leading to their exhaustion, both physically and mentally The admirable surge of solidarity, resilience and self-sacrifice shown on a daily basis by these professionals and many others should not obscure the awareness of the mental &gt; of caring","output":"[Compassion fatigue: an inevitable reality in the context of a pandemic crisis ?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research is a narrative critical literature review of the use of the PsyCap (psychological capital) model to study online university students learning experiences in order to understand their persistence PsyCap (Hope, Efficacy, Resilience and Optimism, abbreviated as HERO) has been proven an effective model of understanding the intrinsic characteristics that motivate working adults to persist in workplace excellence Prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, working adults comprised the majority of the online university student population Online programmes were formed and developed predominantly to serve their needs, yet these students struggle to persist and succeed The PsyCap model used to understand their success in the workplace is underutilised in studying their success as online learners Students individual needs and expectations have transitioned from the baby boomer generational cohort to millennials and now entering Generation Z This article synthesises the cross-section of literature canvassing online education, student generational cohort transitions and the use of the PsyCap model up to the present era Results reveal that the changing psychological capacity of university students warrants further research of the PsyCap model with relation to online university student persistence ? 2020 The Author(s) Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","output":"The missing HEROs: the absence of, and need for, PsyCap research of online university students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human thoracic cavity houses a pair of lungs, the left lung and the right lung.

However, the effect of the drug on the duration of infectious viral shedding and viral mutations is unknown. In this study, we investigated the clinical efficacy of REGN-CoV2 treatment in patients with mild to moderate disease and compared its antiviral effects against different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Methods Viral culture and PCR testing were performed on the pharyngeal swabs collected from 28 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted and treated at Hiroshima University Hospital during the study period. Of these, 23 patients were treated with REGN-CoV2. The patients were classified into the REGN-CoV2(+) and REGN-CoV2(-) groups, and the clinical course was compared between the groups. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of REGN-CoV2 against the isolated virus strains were determined. Results After treatment with REGN-CoV2, the virus culture positivity rate was greatly reduced. The time to negative viral culture was significantly shorter in the REGN-CoV2(+) group than in the REGN-CoV2(-) group. In vitro evaluation of REGN-CoV2 against isolated virus strains also showed efficacy. Conclusions REGN-CoV2 treatment was effective in patients with mild COVID-19 and could shorten the period of infectious viral shedding. This may be an important factor in preventing the spread of infection.

Paradoxically, a direct relationship has been suggested between COVID-19 disease severity and the levels of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, including virus neutralizing titers. A serological analysis of 536 convalescent healthcare workers reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody levels are elevated in individuals that experience severe disease. The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody is dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3. In addition, individuals that experience severe disease show elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody binding to the inflammatory receptor FcRIIIa. Based on these correlational studies, we propose that Spike-specific IgG subclass utilization may contribute to COVID-19 disease severity through potent Fc-mediated effector functions.

The scale evaluates the emotional responses to COVID-19. To date, the FCV-19S has been translated and validated in about 20 languages and has been used in many published research. The current study aimed to validate the Polish version of the FCV-19S. METHOD: The FCV-19S was translated into Polish using forward- and back-translation. From May 15(th) to June 15(th) 2020, a total of 708 community members (Sample 1: 383 persons, 209 females, Sample 2: 325 persons, 198 females) participated in the online study. The participants were recruited using online advertisements in social media. Participation was anonymous, voluntary, and without compensation. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the one-factor structure of the FCV-19S. Then, measurement invariance was analyzed across samples, gender and age groups. To assess the validity of the scale, correlations between the FCV-19S and the remaining scales were computed. RESULTS: Internal consistency of the FCV-19S was good in both samples (Cronbachs alpha 0.89 and 0.85). The CFA showed that the one-factor model fits the data well (RMSEA = 0.067, 90% CI [0.059C0.094], CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.965, GFI = 0.986). The criteria for configural, metric, scalar and strict invariance were met for all models tested. The FCV-19S scores correlated significantly with age, subjective vulnerability to the disease, neuroticism, self-reported compliance with the pandemic measures, and three kinds of preventive behavior (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfecting things). CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the FCV-19S had a unidimensional structure, good reliability, and correlated as predicted with other variables. With the FCV-19S and the obtained results, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the government can gain more valuable information about people who may be at risk for negative psychological outcomes during the pandemic or who are not implementing protective behavior.

Ineffective care transitions can be caused by high incidences of post-discharge adverse events, by poor communication with patients, and/or by inadequate information transfer between providers from the hospital to home. Any one of these can lead to fragmented care, high readmission rates, increased visits to the emergency department, and ultimately poor patient outcomes. Despite the ongoing improvement efforts of health care organizations, the efficacy of person- and family-centered care transition interventions on the quality of care and on the patient experience are not known. The aim of this systematic review is to critically analyze the body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of person- and family-centered care transition interventions on the quality of care, and the experience of patients. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review using the Cochrane Handbook's guidelines and will adhere to a standardized reporting format: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group. Following a two-step screening process, data including the full reference, objectives, target population, description of the intervention and control intervention, outcome measures, design, length of post-intervention follow-up period, and the study results will be extracted, synthesized, and reported. Risk of bias and quality of the studies will also be assessed. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarize and present the evidence base for person- and family-centered care transition interventions. This review will also inform further research and will lay the groundwork for more empirical studies on person- and family-centered care transitions. Specifically, the results of this systematic review may inform the development of measures to monitor safe and effective person- and family-centered transitions from the hospital to home. These results may also be important for policy makers, decision-makers, clinicians, and patients/families who are involved in navigating the health care system.

The incidence and severity of anesthetic complications in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an increased incidence of intra- and postoperative complications in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those with negative testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing complications for children under 18 years of age who underwent anesthesia between April 28 and September 30, 2020 at a large, academic pediatric hospital. Each child with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test within the prior 10 days was matched to a patient with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, age, gender, and procedure. Children who were intubated prior to the procedure, underwent organ transplant surgery, or had severe COVID-19 were excluded. The primary outcome was the risk difference of a composite of intra- or postoperative respiratory complications in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those with negative testing. Secondarily, we used logistic regression to determine the odds ratio for respiratory complications before and after adjustment using propensity scores weighting to adjust for possible confounders. Other secondary outcomes included neurologic, cardiovascular, hematologic, and renal complications, unanticipated postoperative admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 9,812 general anesthetics that had a preoperative SARS-CoV-2 test were identified. Sixty encounters occurred in patients who had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing preoperatively and 51 were included for analysis. The matched controls cohort included 99 encounters. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher incidence of respiratory complications (11.8% vs 1.0%; risk difference 10.8%, 95% CI 1.6-19.8%; P = 0.003). After adjustment, the odds ratio for respiratory complications was 14.37 (95% CI 1.59-130.39; P = 0.02) for SARS-CoV-2 positive children as compared to controls. There was no occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, postoperative pneumonia, or perioperative mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher rates of perianesthetic respiratory complications than matched controls with negative testing. However, severe morbidity was rare and there were no mortalities. The incidence of complications was similar to previously published rates of perianesthetic complications in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection. This risk persisted after adjustment for preoperative upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting an increased risk in symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Anesthetic Complications Associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The majority of pancreases, offered in allocation, are not transplanted.

ABSTRACT: On 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 12.44 GMT on 15 January 2021, it has produced 93,640,296 cases and 2,004,984 deaths. The use of mathematical modelling was applied in Italy, Spain, and UK to help in the prediction of this pandemic. We used equations from general and reduced logistic models to describe the epidemic development phenomenon and the trend over time. We extracted this information from the Italian Ministry of Health, the Spanish Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs, and Social Welfare, and the UK Statistics Authority from 3 February to 30 April 2020. We estimated that, from the seriousness of the phenomenon, the consequent pathology, and the lethal outcomes, the COVID-19 trend relate to the same classic laws that govern epidemics and their evolution. The curve d(t) helps to obtain information on the duration of the epidemic phenomenon, as its evolution is related to the efficiency and timeliness of the system, control, diagnosis, and treatment.

The material includes original articles and reviews published from March 2020 to March 2021 and searched on PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. EXPERT OPINION: IL-6 is one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased levels are recorded in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe-to-critical disease. Evidence is accumulating on the relevance of IL-6 as a prognostic marker in COVID-19. Since IL-6 is a druggable target for several inflammatory diseases, pharmacological blockers of the IL-6 signaling pathway were repurposed to blunt the abnormal SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine release. Data are limited to few randomized controlled trials that reported encouraging, though not conclusive, results, indicating the usefulness of IL-6 blockade early in the course of the disease in patients with hyperinflammation and no or limited organ damage. Further research is warranted to explore the role of IL-6 in different COVID-19 phenotypes and identify subgroups of patients who may mostly benefit from IL-6 pathway inhibition.","output":"The role of IL-6 and IL-6 blockade in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims During the COVID 19 pandemic, healthcare was predominantly for the treatment of COVID patients.

To this purpose, we propose a digital twin of patients modeling the human body as a whole and providing a panoramic view over individuals' conditions. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and integrates mathematical modeling in order to provide a panoramic view over current and future pathophysiological conditions. Our modular architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNN) forecasting clinically relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability. Results: We tested our digital twin model on two simulated clinical case studies combining information at organ, tissue, and cellular level. We provided a panoramic overview over current and future patient's conditions by monitoring and forecasting clinically relevant endpoints representing the evolution of patient's vital parameters using the GNN model. We showed how to use the GAN to generate multi-tissue expression data for blood and lung to find associations between cytokines conditioned on the expression of genes in the reninCangiotensin pathway. Our approach was to detect inflammatory cytokines, which are known to have effects on blood pressure and have previously been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., CXCR6, XCL1, and others).

The VTE incidence in children with IBD is reported to be around 4C30 per 10,000 patient-years, with higher incidences for hospitalized children.

Classes of anticoagulants used for treatment of VTE are low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists. However, the use of direct oral anticoagulants for treatment or prevention of VTE has not been studied in this pediatric population yet.

Particularly, HIV-1 Gag VLPs is a flexible system comprising a Gag core surrounded by a lipid bilayer that can be modified to present diverse types of membrane proteins or antigens against several diseases, like influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, or human papillomavirus, where it has been proven successful. The size distribution and structural characteristics of produced VLPs vary depending on the cell line used to produce them. In this study, we established an analytical method of characterization for the Gag protein core and clarified the current variability of Gag stoichiometry in HIV-1 VLPs depending on the cell-based production platform, directly determining the number of Gag molecules per VLP in each case. Three Gag peptides have been validated to quantify the number of monomers using parallel reaction monitoring, an accurate and fast, mass-spectrometry-based method that can be used to assess the quality of the produced Gag VLPs regardless of the cell line used. An average of 3617  17 monomers per VLP was obtained for HEK293, substantially varying between platforms, including mammalian and insect cells. This offers a key advantage in quantification and quality control methods to characterize VLP production at a large scale to accelerate new recombinant vaccine production technologies.","output":"Characterization of HIV-1 virus-like particles and determination of Gag stoichiometry for different production platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has warranted the need to investigate potential therapies or prophylaxis against this infectious respiratory disease.

Four studies examined the impact of supplementation with vitamin C, 4 studies - zinc, 8 studies - vitamin D, and 3 studies investigated the combination of 2 (zinc and vitamin C) or 3 (vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and magnesium) nutrients. Although limited data exist, available evidence demonstrated that supplementation with immune-supportive micronutrients such as vitamins D and C and zinc may modulate immunity and alleviate the severity and risk of infection. The effectiveness of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc on COVID-19 was different based on baseline nutrient status, the duration and dosage of nutrient therapy, time of administration, and severity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease. This review indicated that supplementation with high-dose vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may alleviate the complications caused by COVID-19, including inflammatory markers, oxygen therapy, length of hospitalization, and mortality; however, studies were mixed regarding these effects.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal correlation between KD and viral infections, focusing on respiratory viruses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted among individuals aged 0 to 19 years diagnosed with KD between January 2010 and September 2020 from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Data on infectious disease outbreaks from 2016 to 2019 were collected from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, Korean Influenza and Respiratory Virus Monitoring System, Korea Enteroviruses Surveillance System, and the Enteric Pathogens Active Surveillance Network in South Korea. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to October 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: National databases for infectious diseases were used for a time-series analysis of the correlation between viral infections and KD. The temporal correlation between infectious disease outbreaks and KD outbreaks was evaluated using the Granger causality test (G-test), which is a useful tool to estimate correlations between 2 time series of diseases based on time lags. RESULTS: Overall, 53 424 individuals with KD were identified, including 22 510 (42.1%) females and 30 914 (57.9%) males and 44 276 individuals (82.9%) younger than 5 years.

The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household have a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to an extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission; however, under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.

Consultations should, as far as possible, be carried out by tele-consultation. For operative procedures, the delay between the operative decision and the date of (re)scheduling of the procedure will depend on: (1) the level of criticality of the clinical situation; (2) the type of intervention; (3) the functional and psychological repercussions, including quality of life while waiting for the procedure; (4) the notion of losing the chance of having an optimal outcome; (5) the risk of potential complications from delaying a procedure for too long; and (6) taking into account the patient's risk factors for severe forms of COVID-19. The protection of urologists from COVID-19 should be considered.

High-throughput sequencing is an important technology for this purpose. However, viral nucleic acids often constitute a minute proportion of the total genetic material in a sample from infected tissue. Techniques to enrich viral targets in high-throughput sequencing have been reported, but the sensitivity of such methods is not well established. This study compares different library preparation techniques targeting both DNA and RNA with and without virion enrichment. By optimizing the selection of intact virus particles, both by physical and enzymatic approaches, we assessed the effectiveness of the specific enrichment of viral sequences as compared to non-enriched sample preparations by selectively looking for and counting read sequences obtained from shotgun sequencing. Using shotgun sequencing of total DNA or RNA, viral targets were detected at concentrations corresponding to the predicted level, providing a foundation for estimating the effectiveness of virion enrichment. Virion enrichment typically produced a 1000-fold increase in the proportion of DNA virus sequences. For RNA virions the gain was less pronounced with a maximum 13-fold increase. This enrichment varied between the different sample concentrations, with no clear trend. Despite that less sequencing was required to identify target sequences, it was not evident from our data that a lower detection level was achieved by virion enrichment compared to shotgun sequencing.","output":"Target-Dependent Enrichment of Virions Determines the Reduction of High-Throughput Sequencing in Virus Discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A practical strategy to discover proteins specific to Alzheimers dementia (AD) may be to compare the plasma peptides and proteins from patients with dementia to normal controls and patients with neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis or other diseases. The aim was a proof of principle for a method to discover proteins and/or peptides of plasma that show greater observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in AD. The endogenous tryptic peptides of Alzheimers were compared to normals, multiple sclerosis, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, female normal, sepsis, ICU Control, heart attack, along with their institution-matched controls, and normal samples collected directly onto ice. METHODS: Endogenous tryptic peptides were extracted from blinded, individual AD and control EDTA plasma samples in a step gradient of acetonitrile for random and independent sampling by LCCESICMS/MS with a set of robust and sensitive linear quadrupole ion traps. The MS/MS spectra were fit to fully tryptic peptides within proteins identified using the X!TANDEM algorithm. Observation frequency of the identified proteins was counted using SEQUEST algorithm. The proteins with apparently increased observation frequency in AD versus AD Control were revealed graphically and subsequently tested by Chi Square analysis. The proteins specific to AD plasma by Chi Square with FDR correction were analyzed by the STRING algorithm. The average protein or peptide log(10) precursor intensity was compared across disease and control treatments by ANOVA in the R statistical system. RESULTS: Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as complement C2, C7, and C1QBP among others showed increased observation frequency by Chi Square and/or precursor intensity in AD. Cellular gene symbols with large Chi Square values (2  25, p  0.001) from tryptic peptides included KIF12, DISC1, OR8B12, ZC3H12A, TNF, TBC1D8B, GALNT3, EME2, CD1B, BAG1, CPSF2, MMP15, DNAJC2, PHACTR4, OR8B3, GCK, EXOSC7, HMGA1 and NT5C3A among others. Similarly, increased frequency of tryptic phosphopeptides were observed from MOK, SMIM19, NXNL1, SLC24A2, Nbla10317, AHRR, C10orf90, MAEA, SRSF8, TBATA, TNIK, UBE2G1, PDE4C, PCGF2, KIR3DP1, TJP2, CPNE8, and NGF amongst others. STRING analysis showed an increase in cytoplasmic proteins and proteins associated with alternate splicing, exocytosis of luminal proteins, and proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, mitochondrial functions or metabolism and apoptosis. Increases in mean precursor intensity of peptides from common plasma proteins such as DISC1, EXOSC5, UBE2G1, SMIM19, NXNL1, PANO, EIF4G1, KIR3DP1, MED25, MGRN1, OR8B3, MGC24039, POLR1A, SYTL4, RNF111, IREB2, ANKMY2, SGKL, SLC25A5, CHMP3 among others were associated with AD. Tryptic peptides from the highly conserved C-terminus of DISC1 within the sequence MPGGGPQGAPAAAGGGGVSHRAGSRDCLPPAACFR and ARQCGLDSR showed a higher frequency and highest intensity in AD compared to all other disease and controls. CONCLUSION: Proteins apparently expressed in the brain that were directly related to Alzheimers including Nerve Growth Factor (NFG), Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase, Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), the cell death regulator retinitis pigmentosa (NXNl1) that governs the loss of nerve cells in the retina and the cell death regulator ZC3H12A showed much higher observation frequency in AD plasma vs the matched control.

RESULTS: Before the onset of the corona pandemic in spring 2020, digitization had already assumed great importance for teaching in the technology- and method-oriented subject of surgical pathology. In particular, the possibility of virtual microscopy via scanned slides with a digital slide server has been used in many pathology institutes.

The literature search found no clinical studies that investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes among patients with infectious disease. Eight articles reporting the results of 6 high- and acceptable-quality RCTs comprising 529 participants investigated the effect of SMT on biomarkers. Spinal manipulative therapy was not associated with changes in lymphocyte levels or physiological markers among patients with low back pain or participants who were asymptomatic compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Spinal manipulative therapy was associated with short-term changes in selected immunological biomarkers among asymptomatic participants compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review of 13 studies, no clinical evidence was found to support or refute claims that SMT was efficacious or effective in changing immune system outcomes. Although there were limited preliminary data from basic scientific studies suggesting that SMT may be associated with short-term changes in immunological and endocrine biomarkers, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Given the lack of evidence that SMT is associated with the prevention of infectious diseases or improvements in immune function, further studies should be completed before claims of efficacy or effectiveness are made.","output":"Assessment of Studies Evaluating Spinal Manipulative Therapy and Infectious Disease and Immune System Outcomes: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM The effect of renal dysfunction on the toxicity and efficacy of oxaliplatin remains unclear.

Now more than ever, action is needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy, especially in light of the availability of effective and safe vaccines. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on a representative random sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region, in Italy, in January 2021. The questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, comorbidities, past vaccination refusal, COVID-19-related experiences, risk perception of infection, and likelihood to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple logistic regression analyses and classification tree analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy and to distinguish groups with different levels of hesitancy. Overall, 31.1% of the sample reported hesitancy. Past vaccination refusal was the key discriminating variable followed by perceived risk of infection. Other significant predictors of hesitancy were: ages between 35 and 54 years, female gender, low educational level, low income, and absence of comorbidities. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine involved safety (54%) and efficacy (27%). Studying the main determinants of vaccine hesitancy can help with targeting vaccination strategies, in order to gain widespread acceptance-a key path to ensure a rapid way out of the current pandemic emergency.","output":"Enhancing COVID-19 Vaccines Acceptance: Results from a Survey on Vaccine Hesitancy in Northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively analyze interventional radiology (IR) activity changes in the COVID-19 era and to describe how to safely and effectively reorganize IR activity. METHODS: All IR procedures performed between January 30 and April 8, 2020 (COVID-era group) and the same 2019 period (non-COVID-era group) were retrospectively included and compared. A sub-analysis for the lockdown period (LDP: 11 MarchC8 April) was also conducted. Demographic, hospitalization, clinical, and procedural data were obtained for both groups and statistically compared with univariable analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1496 procedures (non-COVID era, 825; COVID era, 671) performed in 1226 patients (64.9  15.1 years, 618 women) were included. The number of procedures decreased by 18.6% between 2019 and 2020 (825 vs 671, p < .001), with a reduction by 48.2% in LDP (188 vs 363, p < .0001). In the LDP COVID era, bedside procedures were preferred (p = .013), with an increase in procedures from the intensive care unit compared with the emergency department and outpatients (p = .048), and an increased activity for oncological patients (p = .003). No incidents of cross-infection of non-infected from infected patients and no evidence of COVID-19 infection of healthcare workers in the IR service was registered. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease outbreak changed the interventional radiology activity with an overall reduction in the number of procedures. However, this study confirms that interventional radiology continuum of care can be safely performed also during the pandemic, following defined measures and protocols, taking care of all patients. KEY POINTS: ? Coronavirus disease pandemic determined a reduction of interventional radiology activity as compared to the same period of the previous year. ? Interventional radiology procedures for life-threatening conditions and non-deferrable oncologic treatments were prioritized as opposed to elective procedures. ? Strict adoption of safe procedures allowed us to have until now no incidents of cross-infection of non-infected from infected patients and no evidence of COVID-19 infection of HCWs in the IR service.","output":"Longitudinal study of interventional radiology activity in a large metropolitan Italian tertiary care hospital: how the COVID-19 pandemic emergency has changed our activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supplemental resources in science education are made available to students based on the belief that they will improve course-based student learning. This belief is ubiquitous, with supplemental resources being a traditional component of physiology education. In addition, the recent large-scale transition to remote learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic suggests an increased relevance and necessity of digital versions of supplemental resources. However, the use of a supplemental resource is entirely dependent on whether students view it as beneficial. If students in a specific course do not perceive a supplemental resource as useful, there is little reason to believe the resources will be used and are worthy of investment. Consequently, measurement of student perception regarding the effectiveness of any digital learning tool is essential for educators and institutions in order to prioritize resources and make meaningful recommendations to students. In this study, a survey was used to determine student perceptions of a digital, supplemental resource. Quantitative methods, including exploratory factor analysis, were performed on data collected from the survey to examine the dimensionality and functionality of this survey. The findings from this study were used to devise an improved, standardized (i.e., reliable and valid) survey that can be used and adapted by physi3ology researchers and educators to determine student perception of a digital supplemental resource.

The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number (R0) settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high R0, the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low R0, the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low R0 (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher R0 (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.","output":"Estimating the risk on outbreak spreading of 2019-nCoV in China using transportation data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We comment on the study by Hirano et al about the effect of steroids in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome It might be necessary to include only the existing randomized control trials and to reassess the certainty of evidence about the primary outcomes","output":"A reassessment about included studies and certainty of evidence on a systematic review and meta-analysis of steroid for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide- (SSO-) mediated correction of framedisrupting mutation-containing premessenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts using exon skipping is a highly promising treatment method for muscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Phosphorothioate (PS) chemistry, a commonly used oligonucleotide modification, has been shown to increase the stability of and improve the pharmacokinetics of SSOs. However, the effect of PS inclusion in 2'-O-methyl SSOs (2OMe) on cellular uptake and splice switching is less well-understood. At present, we demonstrate that the modification of PS facilitates the uptake of 2OMe in H2k-mdx myoblasts. Furthermore, we found a dependency of SSO nuclear accumulation and high splice-switching activity on PS inclusion in 2OMe (2OMePS), as tested in various reporter cell lines carrying pLuc/705. Increased exon-inclusion activity was observed in muscle, neuronal, liver, and bone cell lineages via both the gymnotic uptake and lipofection of 2OMePS. Using the photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and a subsequent proteomic approach, we identified several 2OMePS-binding proteins, which are likely to play a role in the trafficking of 2OMePS to the nucleus. Ablation of one of them, Ncl by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced 2OMePS uptake in C2C12 myoblasts and upregulated luciferase RNA splicing in the HeLa Luc/705 reporter cell line. Overall, we demonstrate that PS inclusion increases nuclear delivery and splice switching in muscle, neuronal, liver, and bone cell lineages and that the modulation of 2OMePS-binding partners may improve SSO delivery.","output":"Fine Tuning of Phosphorothioate Inclusion in 2'-O-Methyl Oligonucleotides Contributes to Specific Cell Targeting for Splice-Switching Modulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes significant disease in immunocompromised patients and serious birth defects if acquired in utero. Available CMV antivirals target the viral DNA polymerase, have significant toxicities, and suffer from resistance. New drugs targeting different pathways would be beneficial. The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC(50) of 4.9 M but was cytotoxic at concentrations only two-fold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238C265 M) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC(50) of 6.3 M, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216 M. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to one h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24 h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC(50) of 4.5 and 9.3 M. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor.

We show that the N peptide has distinct cap- and RNA-binding sites that independently interact with mRNA cap and viral genomic RNA, respectively. In addition, N can simultaneously bind with both mRNA cap and vRNA. N undergoes distinct conformational changes after binding with either mRNA cap or vRNA or both mRNA cap and vRNA simultaneously. Hantavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) uses a capped RNA primer for transcription initiation. The capped RNA primer is generated from host cell mRNA by the cap-snatching mechanism and is supposed to anneal with the 3' terminus of vRNA template during transcription initiation by single G-C base pairing. We show that the capped RNA primer binds at the cap-binding site and induces a conformational change in N. The conformationally altered N with a capped primer loaded at the cap-binding site specifically binds the conserved 3' nine nucleotides of vRNA and assists the bound primer to anneal at the 3' terminus.

This study sought to illuminate young people's experiences of accessing and using condoms and contraception in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed data, including open-text responses, from an online survey conducted in June-July 2020 with a convenience sample of 2005 16-24-year-olds living in Scotland. RESULTS: Among those who used condoms and contraception, one quarter reported that COVID-19 mitigation measures had made a difference to their access or use. Open-text responses revealed a landscape of disrupted prevention, including changes to sexual risk-taking and preventive practices, unwanted contraceptive pathways, unmet need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and switches from freely provided to commercially sold condoms and contraception. Pandemic-related barriers to accessing free condoms and contraception included: (1) uncertainty about the legitimacy of accessing SRH care and self-censorship of need; (2) confusion about differences between SRH care and advice received from healthcare professionals during the pandemic compared with routine practice; and (3) exacerbation of existing access barriers, alongside reduced social support and resources to navigate SRH care. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging barriers to STI and pregnancy prevention within the context of COVID-19 have the potential to undermine positive SRH practices, and widen inequalities, among young people.

RECENT FINDINGS Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on COVID-19 patients requires the clinicians to adopt infection mitigation strategies such as full personal protective equipment, mechanical chest compression devices, and restricting the number of people present during the resuscitation. The time of intubation is a subject of ongoing research and clinicians should use their best judgment for each patient. Clinicians should prepare for CPR in prone position. Particular attention should be given to the psychological well-being of the staff. Point of care ultrasound has proved to be an invaluable diagnostic tool in assessing ventricular dysfunction and parenchymal lung disease. Although novel therapies to supplant the function of diseased lungs have shown promise in select patients the evidence is still being collected.

Since ehealth is considered here broadly, as an umbrella term, it also covers subsets like telehealth and mhealth. This study aimed to review the literature to identify and classify subdomains of eHealth solutions that have been utilized, developed, or suggested for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane library databases in April 2020, with no time limitation. The search strategy was built based on 2 concept domains of eHealth solutions and covid-19. For each concept domain, the search query comprised a combination of free text keywords identified from reference papers and controlled vocabulary terms. Obtained results were classified, graphically presented, and discussed. Results: Of the 423 studies identified initially, 35 were included in this study. From related papers, general characteristics, study objective, eHealth-related outcomes, target populations, eHealth interventions, health service category, eHealth solution, and eHealth domain were extracted, classified, and tabulated. Most publication types were ideas, editorials, or opinions (46%). The most targeted populations were people of the community and medical staff (80%). The most implemented or suggested eHealth solution was telehealth (63%), followed by mhealth, health information technology, and health data analytics. Most of the COVID-19 ehealth interventions designed or suggested for improving prevention (48%) and diagnosis (48%). Most of the studies applied or proposed eHealth solutions for general practice or epidemiological purposes (48%). Conclusion: eHealth solutions have the potential to provide useful services to help in COVID-19 pandemics in terms of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, screening, surveillance, resource allocation, education, management, and control.

News is extracted from The GDELT Project (Global Database of Events, Language and Tone) which gathers both printed as well as online news from around the world. 60 851 572 relevant news stories were identified in 2019. The intertwining of world news with SDGs as well as connections between countries are interpreted and highlight that even in the most SDG-sensitive countries, only 2.5% of the news can be attributed to the goals. Most of the news about sustainability appears in Africa as well as East and Southeast Asia, moreover typically the most negative tone of news can be observed in Africa. In the case of climate change (SDG 13), the United States plays a key role in both the share of news and the negative tone. Using the tools of network science, it can be verified that SDGs can be characterized on the basis of world news. This news-centred network analysis of SDGs identifies global partnerships as well as national stages of implementation towards a sustainable socio-environmental ecosystem.

The present studys objective was to identify novel predictors of HFpEF. METHODS: The study analyzed the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to assess the association of specific markers of inflammation with new onset of HFpEF (interleukin-2 [IL-2], matrix metalloproteinase 3 [MMP3], large low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and medium high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]). The study included men and women 45 to 84 years of age without cardiovascular disease at baseline. The primary outcome was the multivariate association of the hypothesized markers of inflammation with new-onset of HFpEF versus participants without new-onset heart failure. Participants with missing data were excluded. RESULTS: The present analysis included 6814 participants, 53% female, with a mean age of 62 years. Among the entire cohort, HFpEF was diagnosed in 151 (2.2%) participants and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was diagnosed in 146 (2.1%) participants. Participants were followed for the outcome of heart failure for a median 13.9 years. Baseline IL-2 was available for 2861 participants. The multivariate analysis included 2792 participants. Of these, 2668 did not develop heart failure, 62 developed HFpEF, 47 developed HFrEF, and 15 developed unclassified heart failure. In the multivariate regression model, IL-2 was associated with new-onset HFpEF (OR, 1.00058; 95% confidence interval, 1.00014 to 1.00102, p = 0.009) but not new-onset HFrEF. In multivariate analysis, MMP3, large LDL-C, and medium HDL-C were not associated with HFpEF or HFrEF.

Yet Morrison also limns out alternative modes of healing within a Black metacultural framework that moves between Nigeria, Brazil, and Egypt. As we move forward from the COVID-19 crisis, research has suggested that training more African American doctors, nurses, and physician assistants might curtail medical racism. Morrisons fiction looks to a more basic level in which love of the bodies of African American people is at the center of healing. This article therefore discusses medical racism and applies Morrisons lessons to the COVID-19 moment that her writing trenchantly foreshadows. It focuses on three healers who elide the medical establishment to embody a metacultural ethics of healing: Baby Suggs (in Beloved [1987]), Consolata Sosa (in Paradise [1997]), and Ethel Fordham (in Home [2012]). Morrison fuses an African-diasporic framework with embodied new knowledge that allows individuals to gain insight and agency in a white-dominant medical world that still refuses to endorse the idea that Black peoples bodies and psyches really do matter. An examination of these healers practices therefore sheds light on the COVID-19 moment by suggesting ways that African American people can stay woke and have agency when encountering and navigating traditional health care systems, which even today view the bodies of African Americans as fodder for medical experiments, immune to disease, and not in need of ethical and humane medical care.","output":"When Black Lives Really Do Matter: Subverting Medical Racism through African-Diasporic Healing Rituals in Toni Morrisons Fiction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) is a coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with mild to severe respiratory illness. It is a highly contagious disease transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are being investigated. OBJECTIVE It is known that coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause a variety of ocular pathologies in animals, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis, many of which are severe. However, there is no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the eye tissue of asymptomatic patients, even if the symptomatic incidence is low. This systematic review presents updated literature on this issue. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE COVID-19 has now spread throughout the continents and poses a global threat to public health. The risk of rapidly overloading health care systems and causing substantial mortality worldwide is real. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced coronavirus as a global pandemic. Several studies described a few cases with initial ocular symptoms followed by systemic symptoms of the disease. SUMMARY Although the frequency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the eye is low, ocular symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19. In some cases, eye symptoms may be the first signs of illness. This implies the need for hygienic recommendations and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff and other services to minimize COVID-19 infection of both health-care workers and patients.

METHODS A retrospective time series analysis (TSA) was conducted to evaluate the trends and possible relationship between AC of selected antimicrobials and AMR in Enterobacterales and vancomycin resistance in E. faecium, from January 2017 to December 2020. RESULTS Increased AC was seen with ceftriaxone (p= 0.0006), piperacillin/tazobactam (p = 0.03) and meropenem (p = 0.05), while ciprofloxacin and gentamicin use trended downwards. AMR rates in E. coli, K. pneumoniae and other Enterobacterales were largely stable, an increase in ertapenem resistance in the latter from 0.58% in 2017 to 5.19% in 2020 (p= 0.003) being the main concern. The proportion of E. faecium that was VRE did not changed significantly (64% in 2017; 53% in 2020, p = 0.1). TSA identified a correlation between piperacillin/tazobactam use and the decreasing rate of ceftriaxone resistance in E. coli.

METHODSTwo national matched retrospective target-trial cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death among those with a documented primary infection to incidence among those with a two-dose primary-series vaccination. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. RESULTSThe overall adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for infection was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.45-0.48) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with BNT162b2, and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48-0.53) comparing those with a prior infection to those vaccinated with mRNA-1273. For BNT162b2, the AHR decreased gradually from 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.65) in the fourth month after primary infection/vaccination to 0.31 (95% CI: 0.27-0.37) in the eighth month, while for mRNA-1273, it decreased from 0.80 (95% CI: 0.59-1.07) to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.29-0.41) over the same time period. During the Omicron wave, the AHR was [~]0.50 for BNT162b2 and [~]0.60 for mRNA-1273.

The radiologist plays a pivotal role as CT represents a non-invasive radiological technique which may help to identify possible overlap and differential diagnosis between COVID-19 pneumonia and lung cancer, which represents the most frequent cancer histology in COVID-19 patients. Our aims are: to present the main CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia; to provide the main differential diagnosis with lung cancer, chemotherapy-, immunotherapy-, and radiotherapy-induced lung disease; and to suggest practical tips and key radiological elements to identify possible overlap between COVID-19 pneumonia and lung cancer. Despite similarities or overlapping findings, the combination of clinics and some specific radiological findings, which are also identified by comparison with previous and follow-up CT scans, may guide differential diagnosis. It is crucial to search for typical COVID-19 pneumonia phase progression and typical radiological features on HRTC. The evidence of atypical findings such as lymphadenopathies and mediastinal and vessel invasion, as well as the absence of response to therapy, should arouse the suspicion of lung cancer and require contrast administration. Ground-glass areas and/or consolidations bound to radiotherapy fields or pneumonitis arising during and after oncological therapy should always arouse the suspicion of radiation-induced lung disease and chemo/immunotherapy-induced lung disease. The radiological elements we suggest for COVID-19 and lung cancer differential diagnosis may be used to develop AI protocols to guarantee an early and proper diagnosis and treatment to improve patients quality of life and life expectancy.","output":"COVID-19 Pneumonia and Lung Cancer: A Challenge for the Radiologist Review of the Main Radiological Features, Differential Diagnosis and Overlapping Pathologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research suggests that a range of factors influence an individual's physical activity (PA) participation, but studies among Nepalese adults are limited. In this qualitative study, we aimed to explore the multilevel influences upon PA participation among community-dwelling adults aged 40 years and above living in an urban setting in Kathmandu, Nepal. Men (n = 21) and women (n = 30) were purposively sampled to participate in one of nine focus group discussions. Types of PA undertaken constituted activities related to housework, farm work, and active travel. Individual-level barriers included lack of knowledge, lack of motivation, perceptions of already being active, personal limitations, and lack of time. Interpersonal barriers included household responsibilities and lack of support. Broader environmental barriers included lack of infrastructure for active commuting, poor safety, rising use of motorized transport, lack of resting areas, weak social norms about PA, declining agricultural engagement, mechanization, and improved access to technology and facilities. Some differences were observed between the gender and disease groups. Health benefits, integration into domestic work, opportunities for social interaction, and social support were the facilitators. Interventions focusing on families, highlighting the short- and long-term benefits of PA, addressing gender roles, and ensuring women are better supported represent opportunities to promote PA.

Therefore, it is essential to diagnose it early so that health care professionals can prevent the chance of a person spreading the virus. Because the disease often presents with respiratory symptoms, one method for detecting it is by radiology examination using chest radiography. Healthcare professionals examine the chest X-ray for abnormalities that are characteristics of those infected with COVID-19, which must be distinguished from other conditions with similar presentation such as pneumonia. This requires significant expertise, which may not be available in all parts of the world, so computer assisted diagnosis would be highly beneficial. We propose a deep neural network for extracting those abnormalities as features and classifying the infection. In this study, we examine the efficiency of small-sized deep neural network tailored for the detection of COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray (CXR) images. We designed a modified version of SqueezeNet and Capsule Network and show that even with a relatively small number of free parameters, it can achieve a competitive result while having modest hardware requirements. We use a modified version of fire modules to ensure better convergence. For our Capsule network, we used fire modules as two of its upper layers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fire module has been used in conjunction with capsules. Without any pretraining or transfer learning, our SqueezeNet was able to achieve an accuracy of 94.8 %, sensitivity of 88.0 %, and specificity of 98.4%.

If so, do they feel empowered to change those environments? If not, how can psychiatrists be given a role where they can create meaningful change? Finally, how much responsibility can psychiatry usefully take for changing psychopathogenic environments?BackgroundWe define psychopathogenic environments as environments that predispose to mental ill-health. It is the psychological environment we live in - including income, the way we interact with others (e.g. social media, bullying), what we do with our free time, pressures at school and expectations of our peers. It is not discrete events (e.g. trauma) and stretches beyond life at home (where many ACE's occur).Self-harm presentations to medical professionals amongst teenagers are on the rise, Universities report a fivefold increase in disclosure of mental health conditions in the last decade. Here we consider if psychopathogenic environments are part of the cause of these changes.MethodA 10-item questionnaire distributed to Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists in NHS Lothian, NHS Grampian and Manchester University NHS Trust via a consultant in each Trust.ResultAll 14 respondents said psychopathogenic environments are very important contributors to mental ill-health. 13/14 say the environments have got worse in the last 10 years. 13/14 responded negatively about whether psychiatrists could change them. When given white space to tackle the problem they suggested changes were needed from Government including against poverty / inequality, education, public health nudges, more resources, MDT working and better access to leisure facilities. Given specific choices, 11/14 identified influencing Government as a major way forward.ConclusionThis group of psychiatrists believe psychopathogenic environments are;1) a very important contributor to mental ill-health 2) getting worse but 3) feel largely powerless to tackle it. It is a problem they think is important and want to engage in, but lack time, resources and struggle with the complexity of the problem. How therefore, can psychiatrist show leadership in this area? The two perspectives to consider how to empower psychiatrists to help create change are 1) how they can influence the environment for individual patients, 2) how they can influence public policy and government to make wider changes.Is this the job of psychiatrists? Not alone, but as agents they have a unique insight and authority as both a lens for and director of these environments.","output":"Taking leadership over psychopathogenic environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract From strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus a mutant was derived with a change in the cell tropism. The mutant was able to grow in a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK II) which is resistant to infection by the parent virus due to a lack of receptors. Inactivation of cellular receptors by either neuraminidase or acetylesterase and generation of receptors by resialylation of cells with N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) indicated that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is a receptor determinant for both parent and mutant virus. However, the mutant required less Neu5,9Ac2 on the cell surface for virus attachment than the parent virus. The increased binding efficiency enabled the mutant to infect cells with a low content of 9-O-acetylated sialic acid which were resistant to the parent virus. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein (HEF) genes of the parent and the mutant virus only a single point mutation could be identified on the mutant gene. This mutation at nucleotide position 872 causes an amino acid exchange from threonine to isoleucine at position 284 on the amino acid sequence. Sequence similarity with a stretch of amino acids involved in the receptor-binding pocket of the influenza A hemagglutinin suggests that the mutation site on the influenza C glycoprotein (HEF) is part of the receptor-binding site.","output":"A single point mutation of the influenza C virus glycoprotein (HEF) changes the viral receptor-binding activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","output":"Agile Requirements Engineering and Software Planning for a Digital Health Platform to Engage the Effects of Isolation Caused by Social Distancing: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the study is to identify the effects of behavioral/psychological factors i e overconfidence, anchoring bias, loss aversion, herding effect on financial decision making, in both normal situation (NS) and COVID-19 pandemic uncertain situation (CVD-19) separately This paper used a qualitative method by using semi-structured interview (virtual and physical) and all fifteen interviewers were based in the United Arab Emirates Whereas, the results of the study show that in NS all the factors have a positive significant relationship with financial decision-making But on the other hand, in the CVD-19 uncertain situation, majority of the factors has a negative effect on financial decision making, except for overconfidence, which shows positive effect Though the limitation was a time constraint, limited factors, and CVD-19 itself is a stressful environment and people do not prefer to participate in interviews Finally, the future research direction is to increase sample size and factors to understand the financial decision impact on performance ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Understanding the Influences of Cognitive Biases on Financial Decision Making During Normal and COVID-19 Pandemic Situation in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to Jernes network hypothesis, the binding site of an anti-idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign, or even a self antigen. In recent years, antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-defined anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two anti- idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and confirm Jernes hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.","output":"Mimicry of human IgE epitopes by anti-idiotypic antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Praliciguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that elicits hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction.

At 6 weeks old, male C57BL/6N mice were either maintained on low-fat diet (LFD, lean mice) or placed on 60% high-fat diet (HFD, DIO mice). At 14 weeks old, the DIO mice were either maintained on HFD or switched to HFD with praliciguat (6-mg/kg). Day 28 samples were collected for biomarker analysis. In a second study under the same paradigm, indirect calorimetry was performed on days 8, 9, 20, 21, 32, and 33 and an oral lipid tolerance test (LTT) on day 38. Mice treated 28 days with praliciguat had lower levels of fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) than DIO controls. In addition, energy expenditure was higher in praliciguat-treated than in DIO control mice on days 9, 20, 32, and 33; and day-38 triglycerides were lower. HFD-induced increases in gene expression of liver TNF-, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) in control DIO mice were attenuated in praliciguat-treated DIO mice. The positive metabolic effects observed in praliciguat-treated mice were associated with the restoration of liver PI3K (pAKT-Thr308) signaling, but not MAPK (pERK). In conclusion, praliciguat-treated DIO mice had increased energy utilization, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower plasma triglycerides.

Due to recent COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2 million people died during 2020 and 96.2 million people got affected by this devastating disease. Recent research shows that applying individual interactions and movements data could help managing the pandemic though modelling the spread of infectious diseases on social contact networks. Infectious disease spreading can be explained with the theories and methods of diffusion processes where a dynamic phenomena evolves on networked systems. In the modelling of diffusion process, it is assumed that contagious items spread out in the networked system through the inter-node interactions. This resembles spreading of infectious virus, e.g. spread of COVID-19, within a population through individual social interactions. The evolution behaviours of the diffusion process are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the underlying system and the mechanism of the diffusion process itself. Thus, spreading of infectious disease can be explained how people interact with each other and by the characteristics of the disease itself.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled intensive care unitCadmitted patients if they had culture isolates of CR-GNB and underwent intravenous treatment with colistin. The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) during intravenous treatment with colistin was recorded. The occurrence of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity was compared between two formulations of colistin, Locolin?, and Colimycin?. Treatment outcomes associated with the occurrence of colistin-induced nephrotoxicity were also investigated. RESULTS: Among 195 patients, 95 who were treated with Locolin? and 100 who were treated with Colimycin? were included for analysis. Patients treated with Locolin? had a higher rate of occurrence of stage 2 (46.3% vs. 32%, p = 0.040) and stage 3 (29.5% vs. 13%, p = 0.005) AKI than did those treated with Colimycin?. In multivariate analysis, the presence of septic shock (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10C4.26) and inappropriate colistin dosage (aOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.00C6.33) were clinical factors associated with colistin-induced nephrotoxicity.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2i in prevention of heart failure (HF) events across different risk groups. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of large, placebo-controlled RCTs with >1000 participants evaluating HF hospitalization and the composite of CV death or HF hospitalization. Due to varying durations of therapeutic exposure and follow-up, absolute risk reductions and number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated based on incidence rates (per 100 patient-years). RESULTS Across 71 553 patients enrolled in 10 late-phase RCTs, SGLT2i reduced the risk of HF hospitalization by 31% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74; I2 = 0%) and the composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization by 24% (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72-0.80; I2 = 1.4%) compared with placebo. The number of patient-years of treatment exposure needed to prevent 1 CV death or HF hospitalization ranged from 19-26 (established HF) to 72-125 (chronic kidney disease) to 96-400 (high-risk type 2 diabetes). In mixed-effects meta-regression analyses, the benefits of SGLT2i on HF hospitalizations or the composite outcome (CV death or HF hospitalization) were not influenced by age, sex, or change in intermediate markers (glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and body weight) (all P  0.10). CONCLUSION Despite wide variation in baseline risks and disease states evaluated, SGLT2i demonstrated comparable relative risk reductions in preventing HF events. Patients at highest baseline risk derived the greatest absolute benefits in preventing HF events.

In the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models especially for intermediate length times series data.

Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association. EXPOSURES: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the countys population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates. RESULTS: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14 019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19Crelated deaths per 100 000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a countys income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.","output":"Association of Social and Economic Inequality With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence and Mortality Across US Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as SARS coronavirus, H5N1, H1N1, and recently H7N9 influenza viruses, have been associated with significant mortality and morbidity in humans. Neutralizing antibodies from individuals who have recovered from an infection confer therapeutic protection to others infected with the same pathogen. However, survivors may not always be available for providing plasma or for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The genome and the immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques and humans are highly homologous; therefore, we investigated whether neutralizing mAbs that are highly homologous to those of humans (human-like) could be generated. Using the H5N1 influenza virus as a model, we first immunized rhesus macaques with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA). Following screening an antibody phage display library derived from the B cells of immunized monkeys, we cloned selected macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions into the human IgG constant region, which generated human-macaque chimeric mAbs exhibiting over 97% homology to human antibodies. Selected mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against three clades (0, 1, 2) of the H5N1 influenza viruses. The in vivo protection experiments demonstrated that the mAbs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with H5N1 influenza virus. In particular, mAb 4E6 demonstrated sub-picomolar binding affinity to HA and superior in vivo protection efficacy without the loss of body weight and obvious lung damage. The analysis of the 4E6 escape mutants demonstrated that the 4E6 antibody bound to a conserved epitope region containing two amino acids on the globular head of HA. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated the generation of neutralizing mAbs for potential application in humans in urgent preparedness against outbreaks of new influenza infections or other virulent infectious diseases.","output":"Rapid Generation of Human-Like Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies in Urgent Preparedness for Influenza Pandemics and Virulent Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Latin America, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies. Major components of rabies elimination programs leading to these successes have been constant and regular surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, vital measures to control COVID-19 have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. We aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics to create a conceptual framework for how different disruptions may affect rabies virus transmission. We parameterized the model for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, a city with active rabies virus transmission. We examined our results over a range of plausible values for R(0) (1.36C2.0). Also, we prospectively evaluated surveillance data during the pandemic to detect temporal changes. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies within months. These results were consistent over all plausible values of R(0). Surveillance data from late 2020 and early 2021 confirms that in Arequipa, Peru, rabies cases are on an increasing trajectory. The rising rabies trends in Arequipa, if indicative to the region as whole, suggest that the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies may be in jeopardy.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rabies reemergence in Latin America: The case of Arequipa, Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the first local, quantitative measurements of ion current filamentation and magnetic field amplification in interpenetrating plasmas, characterizing the dynamics of the ion Weibel instability.

Over the last few decades, the world has experienced several pandemic outbreaks of various pathogens and the frequency of the emergence of novel strains of infectious organisms has increased in recent decades. As per expert opinion, rapidly mutating viruses, emergence and re-emergence of epidemics with increasing frequencies, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases are likely to be increasing over the years and the trends will continue and intensify. Susceptible disease hosts, anthropogenic activities and environmental changes contribute and trigger the adaptive evolution of infectious agents to thrive and spread into different ecological niches and to adapt to new hosts. The overarching objective of this paper is to provide insight into the human actions which should be strictly regulated to help to sustain life on earth. To identify and categorize the triggering factors that contribute to disease ecology, especially repeated emergence of disease pandemics, a theory building approach, Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) was used; also the tool, Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification analysis (MICMAC) was applied to rank the risk factors based on their impacts on other factors and on the interdependence among them. This mathematical modeling tool clearly explains the strength, position and interconnectedness of each anthropogenic factor that contributes to the evolution of pathogens and to the frequent emergence of pandemics which needs to be addressed with immediate priority.

METHODS: We developed a model to determine the number of N95 respirators needed for HCWs both in a single acute-care hospital and the United States. RESULTS: For an acute-care hospital with 400 all-cause monthly admissions, the number of N95 respirators needed to manage COVID-19 patients admitted during a month ranges from 113 (95% interpercentile range [IPR], 50-229) if 0.5% of admissions are COVID-19 patients to 22,101 (95% IPR, 5,904-25,881) if 100% of admissions are COVID-19 patients (assuming single use per respirator, and 10 encounters between HCWs and each COVID-19 patient per day). The number of N95s needed decreases to a range of 22 (95% IPR, 10-43) to 4,445 (95% IPR, 1,975-8,684) if each N95 is used for 5 patient encounters. Varying monthly all-cause admissions to 2,000 requires 6,645-13,404 respirators with a 60% COVID-19 admission prevalence, 10 HCW-patient encounters, and reusing N95s 5-10 times. Nationally, the number of N95 respirators needed over the course of the pandemic ranges from 86 million (95% IPR, 37.1-200.6 million) to 1.6 billion (95% IPR, 0.7-3.6 billion) as 5%-90% of the population is exposed (single-use). This number ranges from 17.4 million (95% IPR, 7.3-41 million) to 312.3 million (95% IPR, 131.5-737.3 million) using each respirator for 5 encounters.

PURPOSE To determine whether contrast agent injection rate affects the degree of BPE in women undergoing breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 85 patients included in our prospective study randomly received 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol at a rate of 3 mL/s (group A; n = 46) or 2 mL/s (group B; n = 39). Breast MRI was performed at 3T using a standard protocol including postcontrast axial 3D GRE T1-weighted sequences. Two expert breast radiologists, blinded to clinical and radiological information, independently quantified BPE on early postcontrast subtracted images, assigning a score of 1-4. Mean comparison and regression analysis were performed to assess the influence of injection rate on BPE. RESULTS Groups were homogeneous in terms of age and final BI-RADS score. The mean BPE score was significantly lower among patients in group A (mean of two readers: 1.36 vs. 1.90; P < 0.01) with 70%-72% of patients assigned a BPE score of 1, compared with 36%-38% of patients in group B. Lower BPE scores were noted with the higher flow rate in subgroup analyses of both pre- and postmenopausal women, although the effect was more evident in premenopausal women. Regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood of a BPE 1 score was significantly increased with a higher flow rate (P < 0.01). The inter-reader agreement was excellent (0.83). CONCLUSION A higher contrast agent injection flow rate (3 mL/s) during breast MRI significantly reduces the degree of BPE, potentially allowing improved diagnostic accuracy by reducing false-positive and false-negative findings.","output":"Gadoteridol-enhanced MRI of the breast: can contrast agent injection rate impact background parenchymal enhancement?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen and common cause of pneumonia and bacteremia.

To determine if Nr4a1 functions in response to K. pneumoniae pulmonary disease, we infected wild-type and Nr4a1?/? mice with K. pneumoniae and assessed bacterial growth, immune cell recruitment and function, and cytokine production.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, Il1 and Il6, as well as chemokine, Cxcl2, were significantly decreased in the BAL fluid cells of Nr4a1?/? mice 5 hours post-infection. Additionally, Nr4a1?/? mice had reduced IL-1 and myeloperoxidase protein production. We then examined the bactericidal function of macrophages and neutrophils from WT and Nr4a1?/? mice. We identified that Nr4a1?/? neutrophils had decreased bactericidal function compared to wild-type neutrophils, which was associated with reduced expression of Il1, Lcn2, Mpo, and Lyz2.

The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease.

Muscularity concerns may be particularly relevant for male youths with eating disorders, and were included in assessment of eating disorder symptom presentation. METHODS: All cisgender male youths who presented for specialized eating disorder treatment at one of two sites were invited to participate, along with a group of matched cisgender females, and all youths who did not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth. Youths completed measures of eating disorder symptoms, including muscularity concerns, and other psychiatric symptoms at baseline and end of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 27 males, 28 females and 6 trans youths took part in the study. At baseline, KruskalCWallis tests demonstrated that trans youths reported higher scores than cisgender male and female youths on measures of eating pathology (Eating disorder examination-questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the body fat subscale of the male body attitudes scale (MBAS)). These analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between cisgender male and female youths on eating disorder symptoms at baseline. However, repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that males had greater decreases in eating pathology at discharge than did females, based on self-reported scores on the EDE-Q, MBAS, and Body Change Inventory. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in eating pathology appeared at baseline, with trans youths reporting higher levels of eating pathology than cisgender youths, though no differences between cisgender males and females emerged at baseline for eating disorder symptom presentation.

After adjusting for all covariates, hypertension demonstrated a significant association with activity-limiting pain (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.52, p = 0.02). In conclusion, pain was more prevalent in older Americans with hypertension. The positive association between hypertension and pain suggested that routine pain assessment and proper treatment would be required to improve the function and quality of life among older adults especially with hypertension.","output":"Prevalence of pain in community-dwelling older adults with hypertension in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop fully glycosylated computational models of ACE2-Fc fusion proteins which are promising targets for a COVID-19 therapeutic.

The aim of the study was to obtain current data about the frequency of Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. in diarrhoeic calves in Southern Germany with the particular focus on giardiosis. RESULTS: 1564 samples were analysed for the three pathogens using microscopical methods. Giardia spp. was detectable in 112/1564 samples (7.2%). The mean age was 46.5 days and the odds of being infected with Giardia spp. increased slowly up to 8 times from about 12 days to 30 days of age. There appeared to be no seasonal influence on the frequency of Giardia spp. A mono-infection with Giardia spp. was diagnosed in 46 calves (2.9%) whereas 15 calves (1.0%) had a mixed-infection with Cryptosporidium spp. and 51 calves (3.3%) with Eimeria spp. Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. could be detected in 646/1564 samples (41.3%) and 208/1564 samples (13.3%), respectively, with a mean age of 11.3 and 55.0 days, respectively. The odds of being infected with Cryptosporidium spp. increased up to 4.5 times until an age of 10 days. After that the odds decreased continuously and was approaching zero at about 30 days. The odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. increased continuously up to 30 times from about 20 days to 60 days of age. There appeared to be no significant seasonal influence on the frequency of Cryptosporidium spp.; but there was one for Eimeria spp.: the odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. in March and April decreased by about half and increased up to 2.3 times between July and September. Additionally, as requested by the veterinarians, 1282 of those samples were analysed for E. coli, Rota-, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. using an ELISA. Obtained frequencies for these pathogens were 0.9%, 37.8%, 3.4% and 45.3% with a mean age of 24.8 days, 12.1 days, 9.0 days and 12.1 days, respectively.

Inconsistent application of brushing techniques and neglect of certain areas while brushing are very common. As parents play a major role in the oral health education, the present study aimed to examine and describe the tooth brushing performance of the parents of adolescents. METHODS: Parents of adolescents (N = 66) were asked to perform oral hygiene to the best of their capabilities in front of a video camera and dental plaque was recorded before and afterwards. Papillary bleeding was also assessed. RESULTS: The tooth contact time (i.e. net brushing duration) averaged 155 s  58 s. Gingival margins showed persistent plaque at 68%  14% of the sections assessed. Papillary bleeding was found at 52%  18% of the papillae. Parents brushed inner surfaces lesser than the outer surfaces (41 s  24 s vs. 73 s  33 s) and 29% of the parents completely missed the inner surfaces of at least one sextant. On the outer surfaces parents predominantly applied circular movements (66%  25% of brushing time). Vertical brushing prevailed on the inner surfaces (52%  30%). However, horizontal scrubbing was also very common (46%  31%). CONCLUSIONS: Parents tooth brushing performance was neither effective in terms of plaque removal nor did they fully comply with tooth brushing recommendations such as considering all inner surfaces when brushing or application of other than horizontal movements to lateral surfaces. Regarding oral hygiene, parents should not only be a good role model in terms of timing, frequency and duration of tooth brushing but should also be able to demonstrate how to brush teeth completely and effectively.

Here, we conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website, number ChiCTR1900023350). From May to August 2018, laboratory-confirmed SFTS patients were recruited from a designated hospital and randomly assigned to receive oral T-705 in combination with supportive care or supportive care only. Fatal outcome occurred in 9.5% (7/74) of T-705 treated patients and 18.3% (13/71) of controls (odds ratio, 0.466, 95% CI, 0.174C1.247). Cox regression showed a significant reduction in case fatality rate (CFR) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.366 (95% CI, 0.142C0.944). Among the low-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold 26), T-705 treatment significantly reduced CFR from 11.5 to 1.6% (P = 0.029), while no between-arm difference was observed in the high-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold <26). The T-705-treated group showed shorter viral clearance, lower incidence of hemorrhagic signs, and faster recovery of laboratory abnormities compared with the controls. The in vitro and animal experiments demonstrated that the antiviral efficacies of T-705 were proportionally induced by SFTSV mutation rates, particularly from two transition mutation types. The mutation analyses on T-705-treated serum samples disclosed a partially consistent mutagenesis pattern as those of the in vitro or animal experiments in reducing the SFTSV viral loads, further supporting the anti-SFTSV effect of T-705, especially for the low-viral loads.","output":"Clinical effect and antiviral mechanism of T-705 in treating severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maisha, in the fifth article in this issue (pp. 45-51), reflects on the therapeutic care of child survivors of sexual violence in conflict-affected areas and draws specifically on the cultural context of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Data was collected from a sample of 444 adult individuals split across Morocco (n = 215) and India (n = 229). Data analysis was carried out using two-stage multiple-analytic techniques. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to rank the significant independent variables obtained from SEM analysis. The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy.

We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5-6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015-2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population.

It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several millions. We claim that this is due to the inherent linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known nonlinear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations onthe-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.","output":"Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks for Severe Image Restoration Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; caused by SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected the healthcare system on a global scale, and we utilized the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2020 annual meeting to examine how COVID-19 might affect patients with psoriatic disease (PsD) and the clinicians who care for them.

In practice, a training set would only cover a certain amount of activity types, and it is important to validate, if the model indeed captures the essence of energy expenditure, (e.g., how many and which muscles are involved and how intense they work) instead of memorizing fixed values of specific activity categories seen during training.

With this property in mind, Vid2Burn is accompanied with a cross-category benchmark, where the task is to regress caloric expenditure for types of physical activities not present during training.

Two hours later, the patient developed dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Chest examination revealed diffuse rales over both lung fields. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates, while the echocardiography was normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and the crazy paving appearance, which is the typical radiological finding of COVID-19, was reported.

Peripheral nerve transfers have recently become a popular technique to augment nerve repairs and reduce the reinnervation distance before distal motor endplates irreversibly degenerate, leading to incomplete recovery. Objectives To systematically review and analyse the recent literature regarding anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) to ulnar nerve transfers, including demographics, indications, outcomes, and complications. Methods A search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane databases using the keywords ulnar nerve, ulnar nerve injury, ulnar motor nerve, anterior interosseous nerve, anterior interosseous, AIN, nerve transfer, and end-to-side using a 3-component search along with the Boolean operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Results A total of 341 studies were retrieved using the search criteria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria including 12 retrospective case series, 3 retrospective cohort studies, and a single randomised control trial. Nine studies involved supercharged end-to-side transfer (SETS), 6 involved end-to-end transfer (ETE), and only 1 study compared results between SETS and ETE transfers. A total of 269 patients underwent nerve transfers. In the ETE subgroup, the average time to nerve transfer was 7 months, with a mean follow-up period of 24.5 months. Post-procedure, 100% (37/37) patients recovered intrinsic function of BMRC 1, and the average recovery time was 3.6 months. A total of 85% of patients recovered intrinsic function of BMRC 3. In the SETS group, the average time to nerve transfer was 2.5 months. The average follow-up in this cohort was 13.2 months. About 93% (145/156) recovered the intrinsic function of BMRC 1, and the average time to recovery was 7 months. About 75% of patients recovered the intrinsic function of BMRC 3 in their first dorsal interossei. Conclusion AIN to ulnar nerve transfer carries low morbidity, and there is low quality evidence to suggest recovery of intrinsic muscle function compared with conventional primary repair techniques. The supercharged end-to-side transfer (SETS) seems to be more favourable compared with end-to-side transfer.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Provincial Overdose Cohort, which contains data for patients in British Columbia who had an opioid-related overdose between 2015 and 2017, along with a 20% random sample of BC residents for comparison. We examined all nonfatal visits to the emergency department between Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2016, among persons aged 14 to 74 years and compared the 12-month mortality between those with overdose-related visits and those with non-overdose-related visits. We estimated the hazard ratio for death, with adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity and disposition (discharged or left against medical advice). RESULTS: We included 3593 persons with overdose-related visits and 216 453 with non-overdose-related visits to the emergency department. Those with overdose-related visits were younger, were predominantly male and had more mental health conditions. The 12-month crude mortality probability was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7%C6.2%) in this group and 1.7% (95% CI 1.6%C1.8%) among those with non-overdose-related visits. After adjustment, for persons who were discharged, the 12-month mortality hazard was 3.5 (95% CI 3.0C4.2) times higher among those with overdose-related visits than those with non-overdose-related visits. For persons who left against medical advice, the mortality hazard was 7.1 (95% CI 4.0C12.5) times higher among those with opioid overdose. INTERPRETATION: Among persons with overdose-related visits to the emergency department, 12-month mortality was higher than among those with non-overdose-related visits.

To overcome the aforementioned problems, we proposed a context-aware feature deep interaction learning (CFDIL) method to explore users preferences and then perform app recommendation by learning potential userCapp relationships in different contexts. The novelty of CFDIL is as follows: (1) CFDIL incorporates contextual features into users preferences modeling by constructing novel user and app feature portraits. (2) The problem of data sparsity is effectively solved by the use of dense user and app feature portraits, as well as the tensor operations for label sets. (3) CFDIL trains a new deep network structure, which can make accurate app recommendation using the contextual information and attribute information of users and apps. We applied CFDIL on three real datasets and conducted extensive experiments, which shows that CFDIL outperforms the benchmark methods.","output":"CFDIL: a context-aware feature deep interaction learning for app recommendation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can play a key role in preventing, detecting, and monitoring epidemics.

Patients with cancer, as well as survivors, who continue to smoke are at a greater risk for poor cancer treatment outcomes. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased frequency and severity of the infection in patients with cancer. Furthermore, smoking and/or vaping increases incidence or likelihood of progression of COVID-19. Cigarette smoking, cancer, and COVID-19 each impose disproportionate burden of illness and death among racial and ethnic minorities. Geographic and population-specific analyses reveal that neighborhoods with lower income and higher minority populations have more tobacco/vape shops and face increased risk associated with tobacco marketing.

In the present study, structure-based virtual screening, machine learning (ML), and a ligand-based similarity search were conducted for the PubChem database against both 1- and 2-AR. Initially, all docked molecules were screened using the threshold binding energy value. Molecules with a better binding affinity were further used for segregation as active and inactive through ML. The pharmacokinetic assessment was carried out on molecules retained in the above step. Further, similarity searching of the ChEMBL and DrugBank databases was performed. From detailed analysis of the above data, four compounds for each of 1- and 2-AR were found to be promising in nature. A number of critical ligand-binding amino acids formed potential hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of each molecule bound with the respective target was performed. A number of parameters obtained from the MD simulation trajectories were calculated and substantiated the stability between the protein-ligand complex. Hence, it can be postulated that the final molecules might be crucial for CDs subjected to experimental validation.","output":"Screening of 1- and 2-Adrenergic Receptor Modulators through Advanced Pharmacoinformatics and Machine Learning Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) aka SARS-CoV spread over southern China for the first time in 2002-2003 and history repeated again since last year and take away more than two million people so far.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both injection botulinum toxin type A (botox) and surgical lip repositioning in the correction of the gummy smile due to hyperactive upper lip according to the resulting smile and the patients' satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study consisted of 24 patients: 12 received the BTX-A (botulinum toxin type-A) injection and the remaining 12 underwent the surgical procedure (lip repositioning). The patients rated their satisfaction according to their gingival display that was defined as the difference between the lower margin of the upper lip and the superior margin of the right incisor, and patients were followed at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months. Post injection and post-surgery with changes documented by photographs. Both groups answered a questionnaire addressing the overall appearance and they were asked to rate the improvement of their smile according to a 5-point aesthetic scale. RESULTS The patients rated the effects of BTX-A as highly favorable if we take into consideration that BTX-A had a temporary effect while the surgical procedure (lip repositioning) had a relapse likelihood of more than 80% because the lip reverted back to its original position with almost complete relapse after 6 months and not to mention the risks affiliated with the surgical procedures. CONCLUSION BTX-A injection exhibits better results than those of surgery and had given safer and more satisfactory results and achieved the required cosmetic patient requirement than lip repositioning.","output":"[Comparative efficacy of Botox and surgical lip repositioning in the correction of gummy smile]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergency logistics distribution of disasters and accidents is an effective means to reduce the loss of lives and property.

Frameshifting occurs in response to specific signals in the mRNA; a slippery sequence, where the ribosome changes frame, and a stimulatory RNA secondary structure, usually a pseudoknot, located immediately downstream. During the frameshift the ribosome slips backwards by a single nucleotide (in the 5-wards/1 direction) and continues translation in the new, overlapping reading frame, generating a fusion protein composed of the products of both the original and the 1 frame coding regions. In eukaryotes, frameshifting is largely a phenomenon of virus gene expression and associated predominantly with the expression of viral replicases. Research on frameshifting impacts upon diverse topics, including the ribosomal elongation cycle, RNA structure and function, tRNA modification, virus replication, antiviral intervention, evolution and bioinformatics. This chapter focuses on the structure and function of frameshift-stimulatory RNA pseudoknots and mechanistic aspects of ribosomal frameshifting.

COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections were examined in fully vaccinated ([]14 days after 2nd dose) IC individuals (IC cohort), 12 mutually exclusive IC condition groups, and a non-IC cohort. IC conditions were identified using an algorithm based on diagnosis codes and immunosuppressive (IS) medication usage. Results: Of 1,277,747 individuals []16 years of age who received 2 BNT162b2 doses, 225,796 (17.7%) were identified as IC (median age: 58 years; 56.3% female). The most prevalent IC conditions were solid malignancy (32.0%), kidney disease (19.5%), and rheumatologic/inflammatory conditions (16.7%). Among the fully vaccinated IC and non-IC cohorts, a total of 978 breakthrough infections were observed during the study period; 124 (12.7%) resulted in hospitalization and 2 (0.2%) were inpatient deaths. IC individuals accounted for 38.2% (N=374) of all breakthrough infections, 59.7% (N=74) of all hospitalizations, and 100% (N=2) of inpatient deaths. The proportion with breakthrough infections was 3 times higher in the IC cohort compared to the non-IC cohort (N=374 [0.18%] vs. N=604 [0.06%]; unadjusted incidence rates were 0.89 and 0.34 per 100 person-years, respectively. Organ transplant recipients had the highest incidence rate; those with >1 IC condition, antimetabolite usage, primary immunodeficiencies, and hematologic malignancies also had higher incidence rates compared to the overall IC cohort. Incidence rates in older ([]65 years old) IC individuals were generally higher versus younger IC individuals (<65). Limitations: This retrospective analysis relied on coding accuracy and had limited capture of COVID-19 vaccine receipt. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections are rare but are more common and severe in IC individuals.

It usually presents as androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or telogen effluvium (TE) and often has pronounced psychological consequences. ALRV5XR is a novel treatment aiming to regenerate a normal hair phenotype by targeting multiple molecular pathways linked to hair growth promotion and hair follicle stem cell activation. The primary objectives of this 24-week trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in terminal hair (TH) regrowth in women with AGA or TE. Methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in a USA community clinic. Healthy women 18-65 years of age with AGA or TE of Ludwig classification I-II and Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI were enrolled. They were allocated in a 1:1 ratio into ALRV5XR or placebo treatment groups using a random number table. Masked dermatologist assessments, phototrichograms and blood samples were obtained at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Subjects were given a masked treatment regimen of oral capsules, shampoo, conditioner and follicle serum for daily administration. Main outcomes were absolute and per cent changes in TH density and response rates. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04450602) and is completed. Findings 46 subjects (23 ALRV5XR, 23 placebo) were enrolled between April 3 and October 20, 2018. Five subjects dropped out and two were non-compliant. Thirty-nine subjects completed the trial (18 ALRV5XR, 21 placebo). At 24 weeks, the absolute change in TH density improved by 301THs/cm2 (95% CI: 151C451;p=00002), and the relative density increased by 197% (95% CI: 80%C314%;p=00016). The odds ratio for being a responder (0 change) was 27. Efficacy increased 133% from week 12 to 24. Efficacy outcomes were similar in AGA and TE subjects. 667% of the ALRV5XR group responded by regrowing 40THs/cm2 or more hair. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation In women with AGA or TE, ALRV5XR treatment significantly increased hair regrowth without adverse events. ALRV5XR displayed a multi-fold improved efficacy and response rate when compared to published trials of standard therapy. Progressive acceleration of TH regrowth suggests regeneration of the structure and function of non-productive telogen follicles and prolonged treatment may restore a normal hair phenotype.","output":"Safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in women with androgenetic alopecia or telogen effluvium: A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Whether pre-infection use of immunosuppressant drugs is associated with COVID-19 severity remains unclear.

To mitigate the impact of this disease, these countries implemented intervention measures including self-isolation, the closure of schools, banning of public gatherings, social distancing and border closures. Several epidemiological models have been used to improve our understanding of COVID-19 trajectory. This has helped inform decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This study presents estimates of the cases and fatalities due to COVID-19 and attempts to forecast the impact of governmental interventions in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. . Methods: We used time series COVID-19 case and mortality data collated from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) repository and an extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) compartmental model incorporating quarantine and vaccination compartments to account for transmission dynamics and vaccine-induced immunity over time. The predication accuracy was evaluated using the root mean square error and mean absolute error. Results: The number of new and confirmed cases show an exponential trend since March 02 2020. The mean basic reproductive number (R 0 ) was between 1.32 (95% CI, 1.17 - 1.49) in Rwanda and 8.52 (95% CI: 3.73 - 14.10) in Kenya, under exponential growth. There would be a total of 115,505 (95% CI:109,999 - 121,264), 7,072,584 (6,945,505 - 7,203,084), 18,248,566(18,100,299 - 18,391,438), 410,599 (399,776 - 421528), 386,020 (376,478 - 396244), 107,265 (95,757 - 119982), 3,145,602 (3,089,070 - 3205017) infected cases under the current country blockade by January 16/2022 in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda respectively. We show that the low apparent morbidity and mortality observed in EACs, is likely biased by underestimation of infected and mortality cases. Conclusion: The current NPI measures can effectively reduce further spread of COVID-19 and should be strengthened. The observed reduction in R 0 is consistent with intervention measures implemented in EACs, in particular, lockdowns and roll-out of vaccination programmes. Future work should account for the negative impact of the interventions to the economy and food systems.","output":"Using outbreak data to estimate the dynamic COVID-19 landscape in Eastern Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Primary Care (PC) must attend and follow COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms, and identify severe cases. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients attended in PC with suspicious COVID-19 and health care provision by PC. METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal observational study of electronic health records (EHR) and agendas. Probabilistic sampling of suspicious COVID-19 patients' pathway in 5 health centers in Madrid between March 16 and 20, 2020. The variables used were sociodemographic, symptoms, examination, radiography, characteristics of schedules and professional sick leaves. Descriptive analysis and time to event (pneumonia). RESULTS: 240 EHR were reviewed. Average age 48 years, 60% women. Most frequent symptoms: cough (80%) and elevation of temperature (63%). Pneumonia appeared in 23%. 73% were bilateral. Age and male gender were related to pneumonia. 20% required admission. 7 patients died (2.9%). 19,027 COVID-19 appointments were scheduled in PC. 60% of patients were attended in PC without performing chest X-ray or assistance by other care level. 22.4% of GPs working days were absent because of sick leaves. Differences were found amongst facilities in chest X-ray requesting (max. 62%, min. 2%). The PC center with the fewest X-rays requested was the one with the major number of sick leaves. CONCLUSIONS: Age and male gender were related to pneumonia onset in PC. Health care activity was intense, and variability was found amongst facilities. Professional sick leaves could affect the quality of care.","output":"[COVID suspected patients in Primary Care in Madrid at the beginning of first wave: Clinical characteristics and healthcare assistance.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine psychological distress and professional burnout in a cohort of Australian mental healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: This study examined a multi-disciplinary cohort of mental healthcare workers in a large metropolitan service in Australia.

In this study 500 stool specimens taken from 1996 to 1998 from children with acute diarrhea in Buenos Aires were examined. Group A rotavirus was unequivocally demonstrated in 62% of the samples tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of VP6 antigen, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of double-stranded RNA, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for amplification of the VP7:G (1, 062 bp) and VP4:P (876 bp) genes. Only five positive specimens were found by RT-PCR but not by ELISA. G and P typing was carried out by nested amplification of variable sequences of the VP7 and the VP4 genes with six G- and five P-type-specific primers (multiplex PCR). Results obtained by this method showed the prevalence of the following G and P types: G1, 39%; G2, 43%; G4, 4%; P[8], 16%; P[4], 71%. Unexpectedly, the G-P type combination most frequently found was G2P[4] (43%) rather than G1P[8] (12%), which is the most commonly found worldwide. Unusual strains of the type G1P[4] accounted for 14% of the total, while mixed infections with more than one type were found in 10% of the samples. Detection of fecal rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgA antibodies in consecutive samples of two patients taken at daily intervals demonstrated that high levels of IgM and IgA antibodies were detected on day 1 after the onset of disease and that the samples remained positive for about 10 days, after which virus shedding was no longer observed. Multiplex PCR offers a sensitive and specific alternative to determine the prevalence of group A rotavirus G and P types and to identify the emergence of uncommon strains, whereas detection of fecal IgM and IgA antibodies represents a useful supplement to virus detection for the diagnosis of current or recently acquired infections.","output":"VP7 and VP4 genotyping of human group A rotavirus in Buenos Aires, Argentina."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests. Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.","output":"Current and Future Point-of-Care Tests for Emerging and New Respiratory Viruses and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one of the most important elements of the chain of survival. Since 2015, international health societies and associations have recognized KIDS SAVE LIVES (KSL) as an essential initiative on CPR principles dissemination among schoolchildren. Children can be potential multipliers of the CPR competencies by teaching families, relatives, and friends. This review aimed to determine the main CPR issues raised in the KSL-associated publications. RECENT FINDINGS We found 12 Editorials, 9 Letters, 2 Special Reports, 4 Reviews, 2 Guidelines, 9 Original Articles and 17 Conference Presentations on KSL history, the schoolchildren CPR education, and KSL program implementation in several countries. In nine original studies, the main issues were instructors' and learners' CPR knowledge, skills, and retention, gender and physical aspects affecting CPR performance, types of KSL programs and new technologies to teach CPR. SUMMARY The KSL-associated literature is limited to support KSL benefits. However, the KSL could potentially contribute to improve out-of-hospital CPR performed by lay people at earlier age in different countries. Children are an important target group to diffuse CPR principles ('CHECK-CALL-COMPRESS'), as they are curious, motivated and enjoy teaching others.","output":"KIDS SAVE LIVES: a narrative review of associated scientific production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the current scenario of urban agglomerations, drawing attention to the growth of population and the process of unruled urbanization that endangers the delicate balance between human settlements and the surrounding environment It focuses on the heritage values as fundamental elements for a correct urban development and highlights the impacts that metropolises and megacities have on climate change and the effects on them produced by COVID-19 It then looks at the role that minor cities and towns play and the coming opportunity to revamp them using new technologies and connectivity corridors and to mitigate urbanization It concludes by observing how complex urban problems must be faced with a comprehensive vision that is driven by the social quality approach and an engagement with the BRICS countries","output":"Urbanization and Sustainability after the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to develop a comprehensive HEI choice intention (CI) model to understand how social influence (SI), brand equity (BE), and HEI factors influence attitude toward HEI (HEIA) as well as how the HEI attitude is a mediator of the relationship of these variables with the HEI CI.

This article aims to evaluate the implementation process of an integrated psychosocial program developed for colorectal cancer couples. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with eight colorectal cancer couple participants and two intervention facilitators. Normalization Process Theory was used to guide the data collection and analysis. Data analysis was conducted using a directed content analysis approach within a framework approach. Participants had a good understanding of the program significance. For most participants, the intervention duration was appropriate, and was well integrated into daily life. A lack of understanding of psychological nursing, and a lack of confidence in the use of online platforms and other personal factors, inhibited participants experience of participating in the intervention. The facilitators challenge in the implementation process was being flexible in dealing with situations occurring outside of the framework plan. Face-to-face and online psychological interventions require more flexibility, and participant cognition of psychosocial care was the key to the successful implementation of the intervention. Future research should consider raising participants awareness of psychological care to better integrate this type of intervention into participants daily lives and routine care.","output":"An Implementation Process Evaluation Based on an Integrated Psychosocial Support Program of Colorectal Cancer Couples in China: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare, idiopathic, usually benign, mass-forming disease with myofibroblastic proliferation and a varying amount of inflammatory cells. Although it can affect various organs, the biliary tract is a rare localization of primary IMT, clinically, endoscopically and radiologically imitating cholangiocarcinoma. The treatment options are based only on clinical practice experience. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old woman was referred to our center due to progressive fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, night sweats, and elevated liver enzymes. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed proximal common hepatic duct and hilar biliary strictures extending bilaterally to lobular bile ducts. Although initial clinical, endoscopic and radiological signs were typical for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, histological examination showed no signs of malignancy. In total, 8 biopsies using different approaches were performed (several biopsies from dominant stricture during ERCP and direct cholangioscopy; ultrasound-guided liver biopsy; diagnostic laparoscopy with liver and lymph node biopsies). Histological examination revealed signs of IMT, and the final diagnosis of biliary IMT was stated. Although IMT is usually a benign disease, in our case, it was complicated. All pharmacological treatment measures were ineffective. The patient still needs permanent stenting, suffers from recurrent infections and mechanical jaundice. Despite that, the patient already survived 24 mo. CONCLUSION: IMT presenting with hilar biliary strictures is a unique diagnostic and clinical challenge as it is indistinguishable from cholangiocarcinoma, and there are no evidence-based treatment options. Our goal is to increase the understanding of this rare disease and its possible course.","output":"Complicated course of biliary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor mimicking hilar cholangiocarcinoma: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated how the Severe Acute Respiratory disease from Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic impacted transfusion services, transfusion support required by Covid-19 patients and their clinical outcome. BACKGROUND: In Italy, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was registered on 21 February 2020. As of 20 April, about 250 000 cases were registered, 1143 of which were in the province of Pescara. METHODS: We compared transfusion services provided by the blood centre of Pescara between 1 March and 20 April 2019 and between 1 March and 20 April 2020. We assessed the number and type of blood components donated, those transfused in the various hospital departments and those transfused to Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, we documented a decrease of 32% in the number of donations. The number of transfusions increased by 139% in the infectious diseases department (IDD), dedicated to Covid-19 patients, and by 76% in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas it markedly decreased in the other departments. Of 299 patients with Covid-19, 60 were transfused (20.1%). Transfused patients in the ICU were significantly younger than those in IDD and had a lower number of lymphocytes, lower post-transfusion increment of haemoglobin levels and higher D-dimer and C reactive protein values. Mortality rate was 60.7% among transfused patients in the ICU and 39.0% among those in the IDD (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 epidemic had a profound impact on transfusion activities. The important blood demand for Covid-19 patients was satisfied because of the reduction in activities in other hospital wards. Covid-19-positive transfused patients showed a very poor prognosis.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 epidemic on the activities of a blood centre, transfusion support for infected patients and clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, but patient experiences are rarely documented. OBJECTIVE: : To explore the psychology of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. METHODS: : A phenomenological and robust sampling approach was employed. Sixteen patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology with COVID-19 from 20th January to 1st March 2020 were selected. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, phone calls, or face-to-face interviews using quarantine measures. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method. RESULTS: : The psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization could be summarized into five themes. Firstly, attitudes toward the disease included fear, denial, and stigma during the early stages, which gradually developed into acceptance in the later stages. Secondly, the major source of stress included the viral nature of the disease, quarantine measures, and concerns regarding the health of family members. Thirdly, reactions of body and mind included disease stage-dependent emotional responses, excessive attention to symptoms, rumination, and changes in diet, sleep, and behavior. Fourthly, supportive factors included psychological adjustments, medical care, and family and social support. Finally, the disease resulted in psychological growth and patients viewed problems with gratitude through the cherishing of life, family, bravery, and tenacity. CONCLUSION: : COVID-19 patients gradually changed their attitude toward the disease and displayed emotional responses dependent on the stage of the disease. Negative emotions dominated during the early stages but gradually gave way to mixed positive and negative emotions. Active guidance of psychological growth may therefore promote physical and mental recovery in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Qualitative Study of the Psychological Experience of COVID-19 Patients during Hospitalization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cancer centers must implement effective measures to protect patients and staff from infection with the novel coronavirus.

Lysis of infected cells occurred within 3 hr, and histocompatibility between effector and target cells was not required. This natural, cell-mediated, virus-associated cytotoxicity differed from NK cell- and T cell-mediated lysis. Spleen cells from animals infected with MHV were enriched in NK activity and were more cytotoxic to YAC-1 target cells, but did not show enhanced cytotoxicity for MHV-infected target cells. Spleen cells from beige mice, which are deficient in NK cell activity, were able to lyse MHV-infected target cells, as were spleen cells from nude mice, which are deficient in T cell activity. Lysis of MHV-infected target cells could be mediated by cells from the spleen and, to a lesser extent, by cells from the bone marrow, but not by resident peritoneal cells or thymocytes. We suggest the term \\"virus killer (VK) activity\\" for this phenomenon. VK activity of splenocytes from different mouse strains correlated with the ability of the splenocytes to bind purified radiolabeled MHV virions. MHV virions caused agglutination of spleen leukocytes from susceptible mouse strains, indicating that leukocyte agglutination or adsorption may provide a useful assay for coronaviruses such as MHV which lack hemagglutinating activity. SJL mouse splenocytes did not bind MHV and did not lyse infected targets. MHV bound relatively well to splenocytes of other mouse strains, but poorly to thymocytes and erythrocytes. Binding of MHV to leukocytes was not influenced by 6 mM EDTA or EGTA, indicating a lack of requirement for Mg++ or Ca++. VK activity was also resistant to EDTA and EGTA, in contrast to NK activity, which was sensitive to those chelating agents. VK activity was also unaffected by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or puromycin, indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for lysis. Antibody to interferon-alpha/beta did not block lysis, nor was there substantially enhanced lysis mediated by leukocytes from mice infected with virus and thus exposed to high levels of interferon. VK activity was blocked by antibody directed against the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 of MHV. VK activity required infected target cells, because cells with adsorbed MHV virions were not lysed by splenocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","output":"Natural cytotoxicity against mouse hepatitis virus-infected target cells.

Restriction factors of innate immunity play a critical in host antiviral action. However, function of swine restriction factors of innate immunity on ASFV has been seldomly investigated. In this study, we determined five homologues of swine interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (SwIFITM [named SwIFITM1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -5]), and we found that they all exhibit potent antiviral activity against ASFV. Expression profile analysis indicated that these SwIFITMs are constitutively expressed in most porcine tissues. Whether infected with ASFV or treated with swine interferon, the expression levels of SwIFITMs were induced in vitro. The subcellular localization of SwIFITMs was similar to that of their human homologues. SwIFITM1a and -1b localized to the plasma membrane, SwIFITM2 and -3 focused on the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region, while SwIFITM5 accumulated in the cell surface and cytoplasm. The overexpression of SwIFITM1a, -1b, -2, -3, or -5 could significantly inhibit ASFV replication in Vero cells, whereas knockdown of these genes could enhance ASFV replication in PAMs. We blocked the constitutive expression of endogenous IFITMs in Vero cells using a CRISPR-Cas9 system and then infected them with ASFV. The results indicated that the knockout of endogenous IFITMs could enhance ASFV replication. Finally, we expressed five SwIFITMs in knockout Vero cell lines and then challenged them with ASFV.

Physiological responses to infection on ECMO are difficult to interpret as many clinical characteristics are controlled by the circuit including temperature. This study aimed to determine the culture positivity rates in patients receiving ECMO with influenza or COVID-19. METHODS: A single center retrospective study was performed on all patients who received ECMO support at a single institution between December 2014 and December 2020 with influenza or COVID-19. All cultures ordered were reviewed for indication. Patients with fever without specific clinical syndrome or signs of decompensation, such as increasing vasopressor requirement were included. Infections and contaminants were defined by treatment team. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients received ECMO with an admission diagnosis of influenza or COVID-19 during the study period. This cohort had a median age of 44 (interquartile range (IQR): 36-53) and was predominantly male (84%). The median time on ECMO was 360 hours (IQR: 183-666). 43/137 (31%) of infectious workups were ordered for isolated fever. The most common workup ordered for fever was combination blood cultures (BC) and urine cultures (UC) (13, 30%), followed by combination BC, UC, and respiratory cultures (RC) (11, 26%). Four (9%) infections were identified (3 blood stream, 1 respiratory) and five (12%) cultures grew contaminants (1 blood, 1 respiratory, 2 urine). Culture positivity rate was greatest for BC (3/35, 9%) followed by RC (1/19, 5%), and lowest for UC (0/26, 0%). CONCLUSION: Although cultures are commonly ordered for isolated fever in patients with influenza and COVID-19 receiving ECMO, culture positivity rate is low. In particular, no urinary tract infections were identified and the screening for urinary tract infection in patients receiving ECMO with isolated fever is not beneficial. Further work identifying signs and symptoms associated with infection is needed to improve diagnostic stewardship in this population that is high risk for nosocomial infections.

The study involved 38 individuals who were infected directly and indirectly with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), by a super-spreader patient. Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors. In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17C20 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104). The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of room 8104, indicating that a high concentration of gas has spread from room 8104 to rooms across the corridor. In contrast, the tracer gas was barely detected in a maternity ward to the south of room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient. Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain environments, such as that of a super-spreader patient hospitalized in a room without ventilation, hospitals with a central corridor type, and indoor airflow dispersion due to external wind.","output":"Airflow as a Possible Transmission Route of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome at an Initial Outbreak Hospital in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The risk of COVID-19 in higher education has affected all its degrees and forms of training To assess the impact of the pandemic on the learning of university students, a new reference framework for educational data processing was proposed The framework unifies the steps of analysis of COVID-19 effects on the higher education institutions in different countries and periods of the pandemic It comprises both classical statistical methods and modern intelligent methods: machine learning, multi-criteria decision making and big data with symmetric and asymmetric information The new framework has been tested to analyse a dataset collected from a university students survey, which was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 at the end of 2020 The main tasks of this research are as follows: (1) evaluate the attitude and the readiness of students in regard to distance learning during the lockdown;(2) clarify the difficulties, the possible changes and the future expectations from distance learning in the next few months;(3) propose recommendations and measures for improving the higher education environment After data analysis, the conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made for enhancement of the quality of distance learning of university students","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on University Students Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Societies change through time, entailing changes in behaviors and institutions. We ask how social change occurs when behaviors and institutions are interdependent. We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behavior occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behavior that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behavior within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, cooperative behavior may also spread globally. As expected, we find that cooperation and institutions are mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioral source-sink dynamics when cooperation generated in institutional groups spreads to non-institutional groups, boosting their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of cooperation creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a group-structured society, large-scale change in behavior and institutions (i.e. social change) can be best achieved when the two remain correlated, such as through the spread successful pilot programs.","output":"Source-sink cooperation dynamics constrain institutional evolution in a group-structured society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19's first wave created chaos for new NICU families as they struggled to cope with the challenge of a fragile infant along with a pandemic.

It is often suggested that the majority of unsuccessful startups either failed to identify a viable idea, or they failed to execute the idea effectively enough to get to market before running out of cash. Two approaches stand out as being particularly well-suited to addressing these problems: Design Thinking and Lean Startup, respectively. This paper presents the Concepturealize? methodology that cross-applies Design Thinking and Lean Startup as a single iterative process and that enables the entrepreneur to generate real-needs-focussed, user-centred, lean business models. Existing literature reveals a need for further exploration of cross-application of Design Thinking and Lean Startup (and other related methodologies) in the areas of business model development and innovation. This work answers the research question by review of prior attempts to combine Design Thinking and Lean Startup and presenting the Concepturealize? model that cross-applies Design Thinking and Lean Startup in a single iterative methodology and that enables the practitioner to generate real-needs-focussed, user-centred, lean business models. By following this new process model correctly, a practitioner will be guided to uncover a viable way to create value, develop a deep understanding of the value proposition, the target customers and how to reach and serve them, together with the expected revenue and costs, all needed to properly formulate the business model. Finally, the practitioner may use the Concepturealize? model to retest the problemCsolution fit and understand how the customers perception of value has altered, each time a new product or new features are launched, looking to continually add value at each cycle.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute wheezing along with demographic and clinical data. METHODS We enrolled 101 children, n=50 (49.5%) with wheezy bronchitis, n=34 (33.7%) with acute bronchiolitis and n=17 (16.8%) with exacerbation of asthma; (median age 1.412.84 years). Multiplex real-time PCR assay was used for virus detection. RESULTS One or more viruses were detected in 83.2% subjects: RSV in 44.6%, followed by RV (23.8%), hBOV and hMPV (both 11.9%); other viruses were less frequent (<8%). Viral coinfection was found in 38 (37.6%) of children. ANCOVA analysis revealed significantly higher total IgE concentrations in hMPV-positive subgroup compared to RSV (34 KU/l vs 12.7 KU/l; p=0.009) and RV (13.3 KU/l, p=0.022). For both hMPV and hBOV anassociation with atopic dermatitis (AD) was observed: aOR for hMPV and AD was 5.6 (95%CI: 1.4-22.7; p=0.016) and 4.7 for hBOV and AD (95%CI: 1.3-18; p=0.024).

More than 80% of reported cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, with a mortality exceeding 50%. Health-care workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring and transmitting this virus, so the concerns of HCWs in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS were evaluated. METHODS: An anonymous, self-administered, previously validated questionnaire was given to 1031 HCWs at three tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia from October to December, 2014. Concerns regarding the disease, its severity and governmental efforts to contain it, as well as disease outcomes were assessed using 31 concern statements in five distinct domains. A total concern score was calculated for each HCW. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify predictors of high concern scores. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 37.1  9.0 years, 65.8% were married and 59.1% were nurses. The majority of respondents (70.4%) felt at risk of contracting a MERS-CoV infection at work, 69.1% felt threatened if a colleague contracted MERS-CoV, 60.9% felt obliged to care for patients infected with MERS-CoV and 87.8% did not feel safe at work using standard precautions. In addition, 87.7% believed that the government should isolate patients with MERS in specialized hospitals, 73.7% agreed with travel restriction to and from areas affected by MERS and 65.3% agreed with avoiding inviting expatriates from such areas. After adjustment for covariates, high concern scores were significantly associated with being a Saudi national (p < 0.001), a non-physician (p < 0.001) and working in the central region (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of respondents reported concern regarding MERS-CoV infection from exposure at work. The overall level of concern may be influenced by previous experience of MERS outbreaks and related cultural issues. The concerns of HCWs may affect their overall effectiveness in an outbreak and should be addressed by incorporating management strategies in outbreak planning.","output":"An assessment of the level of concern among hospital-based health-care workers regarding MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir has displayed pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2.

ED visits and hospital admission data of 8 general hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2016 and June 2020 were summarized per diagnosis group (communicable infections, noncommunicable infections, (probable) infection-related, and noninfectious). The effects of lockdown were quantified with a linear mixed effects model. A literature review regarding the effect of lockdowns on pediatric clinical care was performed. In total, 126,198 ED visits and 47,648 admissions were registered in the study period. The estimated reduction in general pediatric care was 59% and 56% for ED visits and admissions, respectively. The largest reduction was observed for communicable infections (ED visits: 76%; admissions: 77%), whereas the reduction in noninfectious diagnoses was smaller (ED visits 36%; admissions: 37%). Similar reductions were reported worldwide, with decreases of 30C89% for ED visits and 19C73% for admissions. Conclusion: Pediatric ED utilization and hospitalization during lockdown were decreased in the Netherlands and other countries, which can largely be attributed to a decrease in communicable infectious diseases. Care utilization for other conditions was decreased as well, which may indicate that care avoidance during a pandemic is significant.

Reduced presentations may be due to overwhelmed capacities of hospitals or collateral damage from fear of infection, lockdown regulations, or other reasons. The effect on patients with liver cirrhosis is not established. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the impact on the care of patients with liver cirrhosis in a tertiary center in Northern Germany. METHODS: All patients presenting to the emergency department with a diagnosis of cirrhosis between March 1 and May 31 from 2015-2020 were included. Reasons for presentation, duration of symptoms, the severity of liver disease, and 30-day mortality were assessed and compared between patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 235 patients were included. Despite an overall decline in presentations to the emergency department by 11.7%, the frequency of patients presenting with liver cirrhosis has remained stable (non-significant increase by 19.5%). No significant difference could be detected for the MELD score, the CLIF-organ failure subscores, and the 30-day mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Up to 75% of patients with liver cirrhosis had symptoms >24 h before presenting to the emergency department. CONCLUSION: Despite the overall trend of reduced emergency presentations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of presentations of patients with liver cirrhosis did not decline. Morbidity and mortality were not affected in a setting of disposable healthcare resources.

Public involvement must be diverse and inclusive to enable research that has the potential to reach those that stand to benefit from it the most, and thus address issues of health equity. Several recent reports, however, indicate that public involvement is exclusive, including in its interactions with ethnic groups. This paper outlines a novel community-led methodology - a community sandpit - to address the inclusion of ethnic groups in public involvement in research, reports on its evaluation, findings, legacy and impact. METHODS Through detailed planning - thinking through and taking into account all stakeholders perspectives in the planning and design of the sandpit, relationship-building, co-design and co-delivery between the Public Programmes team based at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and the Greater Manchester Black and Minority Ethnic Network - the community sandpit was held in July 2018. RESULTS Fifteen community organisations took part in the two-day event, as well as six researchers, and six creative practitioners. Six community-based partnership projects were seed-funded; four of these received additional funding from other sources also. CONCLUSIONS Evaluation of the sandpit showed the format to be well-received by all: it levelled power relationships between community organisations, health researchers and research infrastructure; it developed capacity amongst researchers about the accessibility, role and potential of community organisations. Described as \\"not another community seed fund\\" by community partners, the sandpit offered community partners, equitable avenues for collaboration within Greater Manchester translational research and led to the formation of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Research Advisory Group (BRAG Vocal Website information, - https://www.wearevocal.org/opportunities/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-research-advisory-group-brag/ , 2021).

The COVID-19 severity is associated with a cytokine storm. Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are proinflammatory molecules that can activate pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). DAMPs and TLRs have not received much attention in COVID-19 but can explain some of the gender-, weight- and age-dependent effects. In females and males, TLRs are differentially expressed, likely contributing to higher COVID-19 severity in males. DAMPs and cytokines associated with COVID-19 mortality are elevated in obese and elderly individuals, which might explain the higher risk for severer COVID-19 in these groups. Adenosine signaling inhibits the TLR/NF-B pathway and, through this, decreases inflammation and DAMPs effects. As vaccines will not be effective in all susceptible individuals and as new vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutants might develop, it remains mandatory to find means to dampen COVID-19 disease severity, especially in high-risk groups. We propose that the regulation of DAMPs via adenosine signaling enhancement might be an effective way to lower the severity of COVID-19 and prevent multiple organ failure in the absence of severe side effects.","output":"DAMPening COVID-19 Severity by Attenuating Danger Signals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates metabolic cues into cell fate decisions. A particularly fateful event during the adaptive immune response is the engagement of a T cell receptor by its cognate antigen presented by an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Here, the induction of adequate T cell activation and lineage specification is critical to mount protective immunity; at the same time, inadequate activation, which could lead to autoimmunity, must be avoided. mTOR forms highly conserved protein complexes 1 and 2 that shape lineage specification by integrating signals originating from TCR engagement, co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory receptors and cytokines and availability of nutrients. If one considers autoimmunity as the result of aberrant lineage specification in response to such signals, the importance of this pathway becomes evident; this provides the conceptual basis for mTOR inhibition in the treatment of systemic autoimmunity, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinical trials in SLE patients have provided preliminary evidence that mTOR blockade by sirolimus (rapamycin) can reverse pro-inflammatory lineage skewing, including the expansion of Th17 and double-negative T cells and plasma cells and the contraction of regulatory T cells. Moreover, sirolimus has shown promising efficacy in the treatment of refractory idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease, newly characterized by systemic autoimmunity due to mTOR overactivation. Alternatively, mTOR blockade enhances responsiveness to vaccination and reduces infections by influenza virus in healthy elderly subjects. Such seemingly contradictory findings highlight the importance to further evaluate the clinical effects of mTOR manipulation, including its potential role in treatment of COVID-19 infection. mTOR blockade may extend healthy lifespan by abrogating inflammation induced by viral infections and autoimmunity. This section provides a schematic overview, highlighting some of the important findings concerning this pathway since the discovery of TOR in 1991 (Heitman et al., 1991; Loewith and Hall, 2011 [1,2]), followed by a model of the mTOR pathway in the human immune response in health and autoimmunity.

Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five-point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspected COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day 1, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Fifty participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40), while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean, 4.9) and health care worker (HCW)-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean, 3.1).

Particles that were synthesized at different PLGACPEI ratios and loaded with DNA in several PEICDNA ratios, exhibited narrow size distribution in all formulations, with mean particle sizes ranging between 207 and 231 nm. Zeta potential was strongly positive (above 30 mV) for all the PEICDNA ratios examined and the loading efficiency exceeded 99% for all formulations. Internalization of the DNA-loaded PLGACPEI nanoparticles was studied in the human airway submucosal epithelial cell line, Calu-3, and DNA was detected in the endo-lysosomal compartment 6 h after particles were applied. Cytotoxicity of these nanoparticles was dependent on the PEICDNA ratio and best cell viability was achieved by PEICDNA ratios 1:1 and 0.5:1.

Although convenient and widely used, the test itself carries potential adverse effects, particularly those at high risk of bleeding. We present a patient who developed several arrays of complications after being tested for COVID-19 using the nasal swab sampling technique. Case Presentation: An 80-yo female presented from home with a complaint of hematuria. Her past medical history includes rheumatic heart disease status post repair on warfarin, atrial fibrillation and stroke. Vital signs were normal. She had benign head and neck exam, clear lung sounds, an irregular heart rhythm and a normal abdominal exam. Labs were at baseline with hemoglobin of 10.4. Chest x-ray and CT abdomen were unremarkable. She received a PCR nasopharyngeal swab in the emergency room and subsequently developed profuse epistaxis. Initial nasal packing and Afrin sprays failed to control the bleeding and she required emergent intubation for airway protection. She also needed vasopressors due to hypotension. Repeat hemoglobin was 7.5 and lactic acid was 10.4. Bleeding eventually stopped after continuous nasal packing, transfusional support and IV vitamin K. In the following days, she developed fever, leukocytosis and lung infiltrates. She received empiric antibiotic coverage, although no growth from cultures. Endoscopy findings were consistent with ischemic colitis. Later, she stabilized hemodynamically but was unable to be liberated from the ventilator. She was discharge to a long-term care facility after 43 days of stay. Discussion: Nasopharyngeal swabs are the mainstay of testing for COVID-19, however, little has been discussed regarding its procedural risks. Common adverse effects include headaches, nasal pain, ear discomfort and rhinorrhea. Recent studies have suggested that the incidence of epistaxis can be as high as 10% after the test. Alternatively, multiple research centers, including Yale and University of Illinois have released promising data on saliva-based testing. Their evidence supported high sensitivity comparable to the nasopharyngeal method with simpler and safer nature. Also, the saliva-based testing can be done at home, which is believed to reduce healthcare cost and lower the risk of cross infection. This case vividly demonstrates that even the most common procedure can result in devastating outcomes. As such, health care providers should be cognizant of these complications and consider alternative testing method when possible.","output":"From a cotton bud to a pool of blood COVID-19 testing, a double-edged sword?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La pandmie dinfection aigu? respiratoire  COVID-19 a entra?n une augmentation majeure de patients hospitaliss en ranimation pour dtresse respiratoire aigu?.

We created a financial model to estimate the costs for staffing and maintaining a dedicated COVID-19 airway response team based on the experience at an urban academic hospital in the Northeastern United States between March and June of 2020. METHODS: The institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital approved this protocol and the requirement for informed consent was waived.

Our team estimated the costs of consumable items for each airway based on previously published recommendations for equipment and personal protective equipment. A sensitivity analyses was performed for variable numbers of monthly airway consults and different staffing patterns based on a literature review of available COVID-19 airway team structures. RESULTS: Based on the average reimbursements and estimates of the consumable costs, each airway procedure represented a net loss of $34 to the institution. The overall estimated cost of staffing a dedicated airway team was between $109,472 and $204,575 per month.

Abstract Aim: To compile recommendations and evidence on the practical management of pregnant women with COVIC-19 in order to clarify standards of obstetric care in the face of this new disease. Methods: Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a \\"snowball\\" system. MeSH terms were used: \\"COVID-19\\", \\"Pregnancy\\", \\"Delivery, Obstetric\\" \\"Pregnant Women\\" and \\"Maternal\\". As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected. No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article. Results: A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations. The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding. Conclusions: Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.","output":"RECOMENDACIONES Y MANEJO PRCTICO DE LA GESTANTE CON COVID-19: SCOPING REVIEW"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upper-respiratory tract infections (URTI) are the leading causes of childhood morbidities.

FV3 study has provided insights into the replication of other family members, and has served as a model of viral transcription, genome replication, and virus-mediated host-shutoff. Although the broad outlines of FV3 replication have been elucidated, the precise roles of most viral proteins remain unknown. Current studies using knock down (KD) mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (asMO) and small, interfering RNAs (siRNA), knock out (KO) following replacement of the targeted gene with a selectable marker by homologous recombination, ectopic viral gene expression, and recombinant viral proteins have enabled researchers to systematically ascertain replicative- and virulence-related gene functions. In addition, the application of molecular tools to ecological studies is providing novel ways for field biologists to identify potential pathogens, quantify infections, and trace the evolution of ecologically important viral species. In this review, we summarize current studies using not only FV3, but also other iridoviruses infecting ectotherms. As described below, general principles ascertained using FV3 served as a model for the family, and studies utilizing other ranaviruses and megalocytiviruses have confirmed and extended our understanding of iridovirus replication. Collectively, these and future efforts will elucidate molecular events in viral replication, intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to disease outbreaks, and the role of the host immune system in protection from disease.","output":"The Molecular Biology of Frog Virus 3 and other Iridoviruses Infecting Cold-Blooded Vertebrates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The seven pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, which usually cause mild upper respiratory tract diseases, and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, which cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome.

One critical obstacle for the implementation of MIE has been the intrathoracic anastomosis. In this study, we describe a technique of thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis using a linear stapler in prone position and present the short-term outcomes of this procedure. METHODS This prospective pilot study included 46 consecutive patients with a cancer either of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or the distal esophagus who underwent either total MIE or thoracoscopic-assisted esophagectomy followed by intrathoracic stapled side-to-side anastomosis. The short-term outcomes including postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS This pilot study included 41 males (89 %) and 5 females (11 %) with a mean age of 65.7 years. The majority had adenocarcinoma (93 %). Before surgery, 4 patients (8.7 %) had an incomplete endoscopic submucosal resection, 5 patients (11 %) received chemotherapy alone, and 33 patients (71 %) had chemoradiotherapy. Mean operation time was 408 minutes. Postoperative complications classified as Clavien-Dindo Grade IIIa or more severe occurred in 7 patients (15 %), of whom 4 patients (8.7 %) developed anastomotic leakages without any need for intensive care. Another 2 patients (4.3 %) required intensive care due to aspiration pneumonia and acute renal failure. No in-hospital mortality was registered. Only one patient (2.2 %) with anastomotic leakage developed postoperative anastomotic stenosis requiring balloon dilatation.

The resulting production of superoxide instead of nitric oxide leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of oxidative stress with the potential to impair numerous metabolic processes and damage multiple organ systems. This marginal deficiency of BH4 may be exhibited by 30% or more of the patient population that have heterozygous or homozygous mutations of GCH1. As the cycle of oxidative stress continues, there is less BH4 available for other metabolic needs such as 1) resisting increased ferroptosis with its damage to organs, and 2) regulating the deactivation of the hyperinflammatory state. Finally, possible steps are proposed for clinical treatment of the hypothesized oxidative stress involved with PASC.","output":"Marginal BH4 deficiencies, iNOS, and self-perpetuating oxidative stress in post-acute sequelae of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The higher risk of COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCWs) is well-known. However, the risk within HCWs is not fully understood. The objective was to compare the COVID-19 risk in intensive care unit (ICU) versus non-ICU locations. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted among HCWs at a large tertiary care facility in Riyadh between March 1st to November 30th, 2020. HCWs included both clinical (provide direct patient care) and non-clinical positions (do not provide direct patient care). RESULTS: A total 1,594 HCWs with COVID-19 were included; 103 (6.5%) working in ICU and 1491 (93.5%) working in non-ICU locations. Compared with non-ICU locations, ICU had more nurses (54.4% versus 22.1%, p<0.001) and less support staff (2.9% versus 53.1%, p<0.001). COVID-19 infection was similar in ICU and non-ICU locations (9.0% versus 9.8%, p=0.374). However, it was significantly higher in ICU nurses (12.3% versus 6.5%, p<0.001). Support staff had higher risk than other HCWs, irrespective of ICU working status (15.1% versus 7.2%, p<0.001). The crude relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in ICU versus non-ICU locations was 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] was 0.76-1.11 (p=0.374). However, RR adjusted for professional category was significantly increased to 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.50 (p=0.036). CONCLUSION: ICU had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19 infection only after adjusting for the distribution and risk of different professional categories. The later is probably determined by both exposure level and protection practices. The finding underscores the importance of strict implementation of preventive measures among all HCWs, including those performing non-clinical services.","output":"Risk of COVID-19 in healthcare workers working in intensive care setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Chronic pruritus is non-histaminergic and mediated through a complex interplay of peripheral and central immune and neural pathways.

We identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to find shared pathways and treatment targets for pSS patients with fatigue and design a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by some practical bioinformatic tools. And hub genes are detected based on the PPI network. We perform biological pathway analysis of common genes by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway.

To enhance CO(2 )elimination when tidal volume is reduced, the following are possible: first, ventilator respiratory frequency can be increased without necessarily generating intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure; second, instrumental dead space can be reduced by replacing the heat and moisture exchanger with a conventional humidifier; and third, expiratory washout can be used for replacing the CO(2)-laden gas present at end expiration in the instrumental dead space by a fresh gas (this method is still experimental). For optimizing lung recruitment and preventing lung derecruitment there are the following possibilities: first, recruitment manoeuvres may be performed in the most hypoxaemic patients before implementing the preset positive end-expiratory pressure or after episodes of accidental lung derecruitment; second, the patient can be turned to the prone position; third, closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is to be preferred to open endotracheal suctioning.","output":"Bench-to-bedside review: Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation in patients with acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic took the world by surprise in 2020, rapidly overwhelming our societies, economies, and health-care systems.

Early on, it became clear that the virus was highly contagious and had a longer latent (yet transmissible) period when compared with previous pandemics. During the early dynamics in Wuhan, China, the basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 2.2C2.7, suggesting a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6C7 days. The spread of the disease has been further exacerbated by limitations in testing and medical supplies, disconcerting guidelines, conflicting media information, and whether policies are instituted and enforced to attempt to flatten the curve as well as the timeliness of health-related political efforts. At the same time, a swarming number of fast-track publications and interventions overwhelmed frontline HCWs with excessive and misrepresented study conclusions that needed to be implemented at the bedside. Some high-profile publications were even retracted limiting further therapeutic options. Facing these uncertainties, HCWs have been battling with immense physical and psychological stress from a surge of clinical work, staff shortage, bed crunch, potential lack of personal protective equipment and drugs, and profound ethical conflicts.

To date there have been more than 274 million reported cases and 5.3 million deaths. The Omicron variant first documented in the City of Tshwane, Gauteng Province, South Africa on 9 November 2021 led to exponential increases in cases and a sharp rise in hospital admissions. The clinical profile of patients admitted at a large hospital in Tshwane is compared with previous waves. METHODS: 466 hospital COVID-19 admissions since 14 November 2021 were compared to 3976 prior admissions since 4 May 2020. Ninety-eight patient records at peak bed occupancy during the outbreak were reviewed for primary indication for admission, clinical severity, oxygen supplementation level, vaccination and prior COVID-19 infection. Provincial and city-wide daily cases and reported deaths hospitalizations and excess deaths data were sourced from the NICD, the National Department of Health and the South African Medical Research Council. RESULTS: Deaths and ICU admissions were 4.5% vs 21.3% (p<0.00001), and 1% vs 4.3% (p<0.00001); length of stay was 4.0 days vs 8.8 days; and mean age was 39 years vs 49 years for the Omicron and previous waves respectively. Admissions peaked and declined rapidly with peak bed occupancy at 51% of highest previous peak. Sixty two (63%) patients in COVID-19 wards had incidental COVID-19 following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test . Only one third (36) had COVID-19 pneumonia, of which 72% had mild to moderate disease. The remaining 38% required high care or ICU admission. Fewer than half (45%) of patients in COVID-19 wards compared to 99.5% in the first wave required oxygen supplementation. City and provincial rates show decoupling of cases, hospitalisations and deaths compared to previous waves, corroborating the clinical findings of milder omicron disease in the hospital. CONCLUSION: There was decreased severity of disease in the Omicron driven fourth wave in the City of Tshwane, its first global epicentre.","output":"Decreased severity of disease during the first global omicron variant covid-19 outbreak in a large hospital in tshwane, south africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors report the results of a pilot trial of quantitative N95 respirator mask fit testing in metropolitan general practice and how fit test failures were managed.","output":"Quantitative respirator fit tests for P2/N95 in Australian general practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe sepsis and septic shock are manifestations of the host's immune uncontrolled response to infection. The term sepsis is a poorly defined, but commonly used term in the medical literature, and it is derived from the Greek word Spsis meaning decay. Sepsis is best defined as a life-threatening condition or complex caused by overwhelming inflammatory response to infection associated with dysregulation of the body's immune mechanism. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients in most intensive care units (ICUs). It has been estimated that in the United States sepsis develops in 750,000 people annually, and more then 210,000 of those die(1,2)! Infants and children in >42,000 cases of severe sepsis occur annually in the United States and millions worldwide.(2) The incidence of septicemia and sepsis have been increasing in the past 3 decades in many countries because of several factors, including longer lifespan with a greater population of the elderly; treatment with immunosuppressives with a greater number of subjects with organ transplantations and cancers; use of invasive and novel treatment with prosthesis, long-term or permanent catheters; and the expanding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. In national hospital discharge surveys in the United States, the incidence of septicemia had increased from 73.6 per 100,000 patients in 1979 to 175.9 per 100,000 patients in 1987.(3) Surveys in the United States and Europe have estimated that severe sepsis accounts for 2C11& of all admission to hospital or ICUs.(1) Observational studies indicate that 30C50& of the cases are admitted through the emergency department, rather than developing in hospitals.(4,5) The incidence of sepsis appears to continue to increase by 8.7& annually (with an adjusted rate of increase of nearly 300& from 1979 to 2000),(6) but may be greater in the United States (US) with an incidence of 240C300 per 100,000 populations, compared to some European countries (Austria, Germany) with rates of 54C116 per 100,000 population.(7) Despite progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, the mortality rate is still high (in those with severe sepsis and septic shock). Although the mortality rate overall has fallen in the United States from 27.8& to 17.9& in septic patients over 2 decades, the mortality rate was 30& in those with any organ failure and 70& in those with multiple organ failure.(6) Patients with infections and severe sepsis require prolonged stay in ICU and hospital, resulting in increase health care costs. Estimates of direct costs per sepsis patient in the United States are about $50,000 whereas European costs are lower, $26,450C33,350.(7) Thus a crude estimate of the direct annual cost of severe sepsis in the United States is about $17.0 billion.(1)","output":"New Concepts and Emerging Issues in Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the determinants of Internet access and its effect on educational inequality in OECD countries during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited.

In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features.

The analytical approach is followed using an experimental setup identical to the developed OSM bending configuration. Secondly, the OSM bending experiment is conducted to measure the required bending force and to identify which parameters influence the OSM bending force significantly. Finally, an empirical model is proposed considering the analytical force in the first step and the influencing parameters defined in the second step. Regression analysis is carried out using one portion of experimental force measurement to determine the coefficients of the proposed empirical model. The other measurement set is used to validate the prediction model. The validation results of the proposed prediction model show good agreement between the developed prediction model and the experiment results. The prediction model provided a shape factor that represents the topology of each bending feature, as well.","output":"An experimental and analytical model for force prediction in sheet metal forming process using perforated sheet and origami principles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the resultant pandemic, there has been a major surge in the demand for surgical masks, respirators, and other air filtration devices. Unfortunately, the fact that these filters are made of petrochemical-derived, non-biodegradable polymers means that the surge in production has also led to a surge in plastic waste. In this work, we present novel, sustainable filters based on bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalized with low-pressure argon plasma (LPP-Ar). The \\"green\\" production process involved BC biosynthesis by Komagataeibacter xylinus, followed by simple purification, homogenization, lyophilization, and finally LPP-Ar treatment. The obtained LPP-Ar-functionalized BC-based material (LPP-Ar-BC-bM) showed excellent antimicrobial and antiviral properties, with no cytotoxicity versus murine fibroblasts in vitro. Further, filters consisting of three layers of LPP-Ar-BC-bM had >99% bacterial and viral filtration efficiency, while maintaining sufficiently low airflow resistance (6 mbar at an airflow of 95 L/min). Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we were able to prepare 80 masks with LPP-Ar-BC-bM filter and ~85% of volunteer medical staff assessed them as good or very good in terms of comfort. We conclude that our novel sustainable, biobased, biodegradable filters are suitable for respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and respirators.

METHODS: Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. OUTCOMES: A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD.

Current pandemic vaccines typically require two doses and up to 6 weeks to induce protective immunity. In addition, to their role in increasing vaccine-induced immune response, adjuvants may also play a part in reducing the time between immunization and vaccine protection, although this role has seldom been previously explored in literature. This study assessed the speed of protection achievable with a standard inactivated influenza vaccine when formulated with or without a novel delta-inulin adjuvant (Advax). When formulated with Advax adjuvant mice were protected even when the vaccine was administered intramuscularly contemporaneously with a lethal intranasal virus challenge. The protection was found to be B-cell dependent and transfer of day 6 immune serum from mice immunised with Advax-adjuvanted influenza vaccine conferred protection to na?ve animals. This protection was shown to be mediated by vaccine induced IgM rather than IgG neutralising antibodies. The results show that influenza vaccine can be formulated to provide immediate protection following immunization with this novel concept warranting testing in human trials. IMPORTANCE In the past 100 years there have been several major influenza pandemics that resulted in significant loss of life. The time taken for individuals to develop vaccine protection is an important factor in curbing the spread of infection and reducing pandemic mortality rates. Current influenza vaccines can take up to 5-6 weeks to generate full protection leaving front-line heath care workers and others, at risk for an extended period of time. Our novel accelerated vaccine protection approach provides effectively immediate vaccine protection against lethal virus challenge. This would assist front-line workers to continue to provide essential services and maintain critical infrastructure during pandemic. The study also highlights the often-overlooked role that antigen-specific IgM plays in virus protection and provides a novel adjuvanted strategy for enlisting IgM to provide accelerated vaccine protection.","output":"Accelerated vaccine induction of IgM neutralising antibody enables vaccine protection against same day lethal influenza virus challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted healthcare systems worldwide. Admissions for various non-COVID-19 emergencies have significantly decreased. We sought to determine the impact of COVID-19 on admissions for intracranial hemorrhage to a German University Hospital emergency department. Methods: In a retrospective analysis of admissions to the emergency department of the University Hospital Mannheim from January to June 2020 and the corresponding time period in 2019, all patients admitted for either traumatic or non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage were evaluated. Poisson regression was performed to analyze changes in admission rates as a function of year, epoch (COVID-19-epoch, March to April 2020 and corresponding months 2019; non-COVID-19-epoch, January to February and May to June 2019/2020) and the interaction of year and epoch (reflecting the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures). Results: Overall, 320 patients were included in the study. During the COVID-19-epoch, admission rates for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage decreased significantly by 42.1% (RR 0.579, p = 0.002, 95% confidence interval 0.410C0.818). Likewise, admission rates for traumatic intracranial hemorrhage decreased significantly by 53.7% [RR = 0.463, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.358C0.599]. Conclusion: The decrease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages may be a consequence of underutilization of the healthcare system whereas decreasing rates of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage admissions may predominantly reflect a decrease in true incidence rates due to lockdown measures with restricted mobility. Raising patient awareness to seek emergency healthcare for acute neurological deficits during lockdown measures is important to ensure appropriate emergency care for patients with intracranial hemorrhage.","output":"Negative Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Admissions for Intracranial Hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A lack of oxygen supplies for covid-19 patients is a national crisis as India hits record case numbers, reports Puja Changoiwala","output":"India at breaking point"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimal care in nursing home (NH) settings requires effective team communication.

SLE was defined by 2 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded visits in the National Patient Register (NPR) and MBR, with 1 visit before pregnancy. GDM was defined by 1 ICD-coded visit in the NPR or MBR. Glucocorticoid (GC) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dispensations 6 months before and during pregnancy were identified in the Prescribed Drug Register. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (RRs; 95% CI) of GDM associated with SLE were estimated using modified Poisson regression models, stratified by parity and adjusted for maternal age at delivery, year of birth, and obesity. RESULTS We identified 695 SLE pregnancies including 18 (2.6%) with GDM and 4,644 non-SLE pregnancies including 65 (1.4%) with GDM.

Measuring the specificity and the amount of antibody produced by the host immune system with high throughput and accuracy is critical to develop timely diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. Motivated by finding an easy-to-use and cost-effective alternative to existing serological methodologies for multiplex analysis, we develop a proof-of-concept multiplex nanoplasmonic biosensor to capture the humoral response in serums against multiple antigens. Nanoplasmonic sensing relies on the wavelength shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of gold nanostructures upon binding interactions between the antibodies and the immobilized antigens. Here the antigens are first immobilized on different sensing areas by using a mono-biotinylation system based on the high affinity interaction between biotin and streptavidin.

The rapid test, cheap and easy to perform, is therefore very useful in developing countries, where the vaccination campaign has not yet reached adequate coverage. METHODOLOGY: We compared the VivaDiag COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test (VivaCheck Biotech Co., Ltd) with the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) to recognize past infections and to compare VivaDiag COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test (VivaCheck Biotech Co., Ltd) with Abbott Real Time PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay to recognize infection during its acute phase so that it's possible to evaluate the use of commercially available assays in clinical practice. RESULTS: Of the 1,100 patients tested with serological and rapid test, 1,085 were negative both to serological and rapid test, 4 patients were positive at rapid (2 for IgM and 2 for IgG) but negative serological test, 11 patients were positive at serological test but negative to rapid. Of the 300 tested with oropharyngeal swab and rapid test, 294 were negative both to swab and rapid test, 2 positives both to swab and rapid test, 3 positives at swab but negative at rapid test, 1 negative at swab but positive at rapid test. CONCLUSIONS: the combined use of these tests according to the specific needs of users, allows a reliable identification of infected patients in the acute phase, distinguishing them from subjects with an antibody response from a previous infection.","output":"A comparison of a SARS-CoV-2 rapid-test and serological-test in a Public Health Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene overlap occurs when two or more genes are encoded by the same nucleotides. This phenomenon is found in all taxonomic domains, but is particularly common in viruses, where it may increase the information content of compact genomes or influence the creation of new genes. Here we report a global comparative study of overlapping open reading frames (OvRFs) of 12,609 virus reference genomes in the NCBI database. We retrieved metadata associated with all annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in each genome record to calculate the number, length, and frameshift of OvRFs. Our results show that while the number of OvRFs increases with genome length, they tend to be shorter in longer genomes. The majority of overlaps involve +2 frameshifts, predominantly found in dsDNA viruses. Antisense overlaps in which one of the ORFs was encoded in the same frame on the opposite strand (?0) tend to be longer. Next, we develop a new graph-based representation of the distribution of overlaps among the ORFs of genomes in a given virus family. In the absence of an unambiguous partition of ORFs by homology at this taxonomic level, we used an alignment-free k-mer based approach to cluster protein coding sequences by similarity. We connect these clusters with two types of directed edges to indicate (1) that constituent ORFs are adjacent in one or more genomes, and (2) that these ORFs overlap. These adjacency graphs not only provide a natural visualization scheme, but also a novel statistical framework for analyzing the effects of gene- and genome-level attributes on the frequencies of overlaps.","output":"Using networks to analyze and visualize the distribution of overlapping genes in virus genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare differences in happiness and stress and related factors between pre-clinical and clinical year medical students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

All undergraduate medical students were requested to voluntarily respond to an electronic survey. Demographic data, related factors of happiness and stress, scores from the Thai version of the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (Thai-OHQ), and Thai Stress Questionnaire (Thai-ST5) were collected. RESULTS: There were 369 responses, 64.8% from preclinical students and 35.2% responses from clinical students, and 53.9% were women. The mean age of the participants was 20.621.81 years. The most frequent platforms that the students used to track COVID-19 information were Facebook 43.9% and Twitter 43.4%. Both groups had a low level of stress. No difference was found in the Thai-OHQ score (p=0.323) and the Thai-ST5 score (p=0.278). With multivariable analysis, two factors significantly related to the happier students included higher health satisfaction scores (p<0.001) and maintaining an exercise program during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.015). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the happiness and stress levels between the two groups during the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Thailand.

Heads of the household are at higher risk of this effect because of their financial and social responsibilities. This study aimed to assess the psychological well-being and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic among heads of households in Pakistan. Methods: We conducted an online survey in May 2020. A convenience sampling strategy was used to enroll the heads of the households from all regions of Pakistan. A validated English and Urdu version of the WHO-5 well-being scale was used to assess well-being. The prevalence of poor well-being and its associated factors among heads of the households was measured using logistic regression. Results: A total of 509 heads of households participated in the survey. About 35% of the participants were dependent on financial sources other than salary. The news was considered a source of fear as 70% assumed that avoiding such news may reduce the fear. The most common coping strategies used during lockdown were;spending quality time with family, eating healthy foods, adequate sleep and talking to friends on the phone. The prevalence of poor well-being was found to be 41% (95% CI: 36.62-45.51). Individuals with any chronic illness were at a higher risk of poor wellbeing adjusted odds ratio of 1.64 (95% CI: 1.04-2.59). Worriedness was also found to be associated with a higher risk of poor wellbeing adjusted OR 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06-1.19). Reading books showed a protective association with poor mental wellbeing adjusted OR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.42-0.98). Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of poor mental wellbeing among heads of households in Pakistan. Worriedness related to the pandemic and having chronic illness were significant predictors of poor psychological wellbeing.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. High-volume evacuator Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD -47.41, 95% CI -92.76 to -2.06; 3 RCTs, 122 participants (two studies had split-mouth design); very high heterogeneity I2 = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD -1.00, -2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One split-mouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or low-volume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU -2.30, 95% CI -5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD -2.20, 95% CI -14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (low-volume evacuator) during AGPs (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD -0.35, -0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD -125.20, 95% CI -174.02 to -76.38) or HVE (MD -109.30, 95% CI -153.01 to -65.59). Rubber dam One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one-metre (MD -16.20, 95% CI -19.36 to -13.04) and two-metre distance (MD -11.70, 95% CI -15.82 to -7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.00). One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD -251.00, 95% CI -267.95 to -234.05) and dental unit light (MD -12.70, 95% CI -12.85 to -12.55). Air cleaning systems One split-mouth CCT (two participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD -66.70 CFU, 95% CI -120.15 to -13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD -32.40, 95% CI - 51.55 to -13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD -483.56 CFU, 95% CI -550.02 to -417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD -319.14 CFU, 95% CI - 385.60 to -252.68). Disinfectants a antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD -124.00, 95% CI -135.78 to -112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD -656.45, 95% CI -672.74 to -640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD -644.55, 95% CI -668.70 to -620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD -59.30, 95% CI -64.16 to -54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD -11.90, 95% CI -35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colony-forming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 in dental patients and staff.","output":"Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the scientific and human efforts to understand COVID-19, there are questions still unanswered.

Retroperitoneoscopic LESS is a safe and feasible procedure for renal biopsy and renal cyst ablation, with shorter convalescence time, less postoperative pain, and better cosmetic outcomes. LESS ureterolithotomy was more challenging for the lack of triangulation, resulting in a prolonged convalescence period.

This study aimed to investigate the association between three potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL-6 and the severity of susceptibility to COVID-19 in an Iranian population. METHODS: In total, 346 individuals (175 patients with severe COVID-19 and 171 patients with mild COVID-19) were recruited for this cohort study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients to determine the genotypes of three selected SNPs (rs1800795 (?174 G > C), rs1800796 (?572 G > C), and rs1800797 (?597 G > A)) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype or allele distribution of selected SNPs (rs1800795 (?174 G > C), rs1800796 (?572 G > C), and rs1800797 (?597 G > A)) in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene in patients with severe COVID-19 and patients with mild COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Our study indicated that these SNPs are not associated with COVID-19 severity in the Kurdish population from Kermanshah, Iran.","output":"Evaluation of the relationship between IL-6 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and the severity of COVID-19 in an Iranian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance experts are leveraging user-generated content on social media to track the spread and effects of COVID-19. However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents \\"used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus.\\" We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.","output":"Racial and Ethnic Digital Divides in Posting COVID-19 Content on Social Media Among US Adults: Secondary Survey Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearable technology plays a significant role in our daily life as well as in the healthcare industry. The recent coronavirus pandemic has taken the worlds healthcare systems by surprise. Although trials of possible vaccines are underway, it would take a long time before the vaccines are permitted for public use. Most of the government efforts are currently geared towards preventing the spread of the coronavirus and predicting probable hot zones. The essential and healthcare workers are the most vulnerable towards coronavirus infections due to their required proximity to potential coronavirus patients. Wearable technology can potentially assist in these regards by providing real-time remote monitoring, symptoms prediction, contact tracing, etc. The goal of this paper is to discuss the different existing wearable monitoring devices (respiration rate, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation) and respiratory support systems (ventilators, CPAP devices, and oxygen therapy) which are frequently used to assist the coronavirus affected people. The devices are described based on the services they provide, their working procedures as well as comparative analysis of their merits and demerits with cost. A comparative discussion with probable future trends is also drawn to select the best technology for COVID-19 infected patients.

During periods with high test positivity rates, however, case numbers may be underreported, whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation. Here we investigated how the dynamics of new COVID-19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true COVID-19 incidence dynamics. We focused on the first pandemic wave in Switzerland (February to April, 2020), when test positivity ranged up to 26%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were determined 2-4 times per week in three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (Lugano, Lausanne and Zurich). Wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection-to-case confirmation delay distribution, respectively, to estimate infection incidence dynamics. Finally, the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model. Incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases. In contrast, case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections. Under a regime of high-test positivity rates, WBE thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory.","output":"Wastewater monitoring outperforms case numbers as a tool to track COVID-19 incidence dynamics when test positivity rates are high"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymeric materials have drastically changed the society in the last century. However, their non-renewable origin, together with their indiscriminate use and disposal, resulted in a huge accumulation of waste in the environment and raised a wide discussion about the emission of greenhouse gases, which must be considerably reduced to minimize global warming. Thus, the establishment of a consolidated production of polymers prioritizing the use of renewable sources of raw materials became a hot research topic. Vegetable oils are protagonists of this initiative, and their carbonCcarbon double bonds are convenient reactive sites for chain growth polymerization reactions. However, typical vegetable oil-based homopolymers often do not display competitive thermo-mechanical properties, and the preparation of the corresponding copolymers and composites is therefore an interesting alternative strategy. Herein, the preparation of composites based on a tung oil/furfuryl alcohol co-continuous network reinforced with bacterial cellulose fibers is described. For this purpose, the cellulose nanofibers were suspended in furfuryl alcohol, and different amounts of the ensuing suspension were mixed with tung oil in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as cationic initiator. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of all samples indicated the association of both tung oil and furfuryl alcohol in the final materials, with peaks belonging to cellulose superposed at the fingerprint regions of composites. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry demonstrated an interesting relationship between the composition and the corresponding thermal properties, and the morphology of the materials was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed a homogeneous distribution of cellulosic fibers at lower concentrations. The results gathered here contribute to the development of original macromolecular materials exclusively based on the renewable platform.","output":"Furfuryl alcohol/tung oil matrix-based composites reinforced with bacterial cellulose fibres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of the Spanish-speaking media is crucial for how Latinx communities learn about seeking help when experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). This study investigated the IPV help-seeking messages disseminated by the Spanish-speaking media in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We engaged in an exploratory content analysis of videos from Univision's main website, the most-watched Spanish-speaking media network in the U.S. We searched for videos related to IPV help-seeking posted from March 19-April 21, 2020-including the weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the U.S. mandated a shelter-in-place. After assessing inclusion criteria, 29 videos were analyzed. Data were analyzed using basic content analysis to determine frequencies and inductive interpretive content analysis to code for help-seeking messages. We identified eight manifest messages related to seeking help when experiencing IPV in times of a crisis: (1) contact a professional resource; (2) contact law enforcement; (3) contact family, friends, and members of your community; (4) create a safety plan; (5) don't be afraid, be strong; (6) leave the situation; (7) protect yourself at home; and (8) services are available despite the pandemic. We found that the manifest messages alluded to three latent messages: (1) it is your responsibility to change your circumstances; (2) you are in danger and in need of protection; and (3) you are not alone. IPV and media professionals should ensure a structural understanding of IPV in their help-seeking messages and avoid perpetrating stigmatizing and reductionist messages.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Intimate Partner Violence: an Analysis of Help-Seeking Messages in the Spanish-Speaking Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that influence the hand hygiene compliance of final year medical students, using a theoretical behavioural framework. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey assessing self-reported compliance and its behavioural correlates. SETTING: Internships of medical students in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 322 medical students of the Erasmus Medical Center were recruited over a period of 12 months during the Public Health internship, which is the final compulsory internship after an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Behavioural factors influencing compliance to hand hygiene guidelines were measured by means of a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Social Ecological Models. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the effect of including attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, knowledge, risk perception and habit on hand hygiene compliance. RESULTS: We included 313 students in the analysis (response rate 97%). The behavioural model explained 40% of the variance in self-reported compliance (adjusted R(2)=0.40). Hand hygiene compliance was strongly influenced by attitudes (perceived outcomes of preventive actions), self-efficacy (perception of the ability to perform hand hygiene at the clinical ward) and habit, but was not associated with knowledge and risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting medical students behaviour should focus on the empowerment of these juniors and provide them with evidence on the health benefits of prevention, rather than increasing their factual knowledge of procedures.

Sweet watermelon fruit quality traits are affected by the compositions of phytochemical compounds, phytohormones, and fruit flesh firmness which are affected by genes, the growing environment and their interaction. These compositions determine fruit ripening, eating quality, and postharvest shelf-life. Knowledge of the genetic profile and analyses of quality traits in watermelon is vital to develop improved cultivars with enhanced nutritional compositions, consumer-preferred traits, and extended storage life. This review aims to present the opportunities and progress made on the genetic analysis of fruit quality traits in watermelon as a guide for quality breeding based on economic and end-user attributes. The first section of the review highlights the genetic mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of phytochemical compounds (i.e., sugars, carotenoids, amino acids, organic acids, and volatile compounds), phytohormones (i.e., ethylene and abscisic acid) and fruit flesh structural components (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin) elicited during watermelon fruit development and ripening. The second section pinpoints the progress on the development of molecular markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for phytochemical compounds, phytohormones and fruit quality attributes. The review presents gene-editing technology and innovations associated with fruit quality traits for selection and accelerated cultivar development.

The mechanism of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in these disorders appears to be related to the development of pathologic anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, some of which could activate complement. Interestingly, we and others have found that complement activation is vital when both pediatric and adult patients have severe respiratory illness from SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) or in the post-infectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We hypothesized that patients with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C develop similar anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, which lead to endothelial complement activation that drive the inflammatory responses seen in these diseases. Methods Our cohort included 30 pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs: 10 each of severe COVID-19 (Severe, MIS-C, and mild/asymptomatic (Mild) infection. Using ELISA, we evaluated the levels of antibodies to various platelet-related proteins including PF4, PF4-heparin, and NAP2; in addition, we examined the ability of plasma from each patient to activate complement. The antibody levels were compared to control samples including samples from adult patients with VITT and HIT. Statistical analyses with ANOVA were performed to evaluate differences. Results Patients with MIS-C have a significantly higher anti-PF4 antibody concentration (as measured by mean optical density [OD]) than patients with either mild/asymptomatic disease, or severe COVID-19: Severe 0.5 +/- 0.14; Mild 0.3 +/- 0.12; MIS-C 0.77 +/- 0.35, p=0.003 MIS-C vs. Mild); Similar results were seen for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies: Severe 0.4 +/- 0.14; Mild 0.35 +/- 0.12; MIS-C 0.64 +/- 0.3, p=0.003 MIS-C vs. Mild; p=0.034 MIS-C vs. Severe). These were similar to values obtained for the HIT sample (Figure). Conclusion Patients with MIS-C and severe COVID19 have significant detectable anti-PF4 and PF4/heparin antibodies in contrast to those patients with mild/asymptomatic disease. Our previous studies have shown that patients with MIS-C and COVID-19 have evidence of endovascular complement activation in the form of elevated soluble membrane attack complex (sC5-b9). We have also previously demonstrated that VITT anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies activate complement and result in endothelial cell activation. These antibodies in pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection may be involved in the development of more severe disease manifestations. Ongoing investigations will identify if this is due to endothelial complement activation and inflammatory responses that accompany severe disease. This is the first demonstration of the role of anti-PF4 and PF4/heparin antibodies in pediatric SARS-CoV-2.

We prospectively evaluated anti-spike-receptor binding domain antibody (anti-S Ab) levels after the second dose of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in MPN patients. A total of 74 patients with MPN and 81 healthy controls who were vaccinated were enrolled in the study. Of the MPN patients, 27% received ruxolitinib at the time of vaccination. Notably, MPN patients receiving ruxolitinib had a 30-fold lower median anti-S Ab level than those not receiving ruxolitinib (p < 0.001). Further, the anti-S Ab levels in MPN patients not receiving ruxolitinib were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Regarding a clinical protective titre that has been shown to correlate with preventing symptomatic infection, only 10% of the MPN patients receiving ruxolitinib had the protective value. Univariate analysis revealed that ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis, and longer time from diagnosis to vaccination had a significantly negative impact on achieving the protective value (p = 0.001, 0.021, and 0.019, respectively). In subgroup analysis, lower numbers of CD3(+) and CD4(+) lymphocytes were significantly correlated with a lower probability of obtaining the protective value (p = 0.011 and 0.001, respectively).

Alanine substitutions at three key residues in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket (H262, H277, and G275) and a double-mutant version (H262P and H277A) generated proteins with greatly reduced but detectable endoribonuclease activities. Furthermore, these mutant proteins demonstrated lower cleavage specificities for uridylate than wild-type (WT) mNsp15. These mutations were successfully incorporated into viruses named vH262A, vH277A, vG275A, and vH262P+H277A. All four mutant viruses formed plaques with diameters similar to that of MHV-A59 1000 (WT virus) on several different cell lines. Interestingly, viruses with a mutation at a noncatalytic residue, D324A, could not be recovered despite repeated attempts, and expression of mNsp15 containing the D324A mutation in Escherichia coli resulted in an insoluble protein. Plaques derived from vH262A produced approximately 6- to 13-fold fewer PFU than those from WT virus. Cells infected with mNsp15 mutant viruses accumulated lesser amounts of plus- and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs and spike protein than WT virus.

Due to the huge mask demand-supply gap all over the world, the development of user-friendly technologies and methods is urgently needed to effectively extend the service time of masks. In this article, we report a very simple approach for the decontamination of masks for multiple reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. Used masks were soaked in hot water at a temperature greater than 56 C for 30 min, based on a recommended method to kill COVID-19 virus by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The masks were then dried using an ordinary household hair dryer to recharge the masks with electrostatic charge to recover their filtration function (the so-called \\"hot water decontamination + charge regeneration\\" method). Three kinds of typical masks (disposable medical masks, surgical masks, and KN95-grade masks) were treated and tested. The filtration efficiencies of the regenerated masks were almost maintained and met the requirements of the respective standards. These findings should have important implications for the reuse of polypropylene masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The performance evolution of masks during human wear was further studied, and a company (Zhejiang Runtu Co., Ltd.) applied this method to enable their workers to extend the use of masks.

Case overview/synopsis: In 2020, NBF launched a new digital platform for SMEs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called NBF Connect with the purpose of redefining banking services for the small businesses sector. The digitalization wave in the UAE was revolutionizing various industry sectors. The global banking industry was already impacted by digitalization and some banks in the UAE, especially in the retail segment (Emirates NBD, 2017), had already introduced many technology-led innovations bringing more effectiveness in the processes and better customer experience. However, the SME banking segment was lagging in terms of innovation. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic situation, with compulsory lockdowns and social distancing, changed the way of doing business for entire industries and increased the pressure on banks for the provisioning of new digital products. Rose joined NBF in the first part of 2020 as Product Owner of the project NBF Connect. The new digital platform was ideated by NBF to be differentiated from other banking products. It was co-created with insights from and regular interaction with the SME community. After the deployment of the first version of the platform in April 2020, Rose realized that the user adoption and commercial results were below par.

In this research study, long-range all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were engaged for the bound and the unbound proteins to enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hsp90 dimerization and inhibition. Results evidently showed that coumermycin A1 (CCA1), a recently discovered Hsp90 inhibitor, binds at the dimers active site of the Hsp90 protein and leads to a substantial parting between dimeric opposed residues, which include Arg591.B, Lys594.A, Ser663.A, Thr653.B, Ala665.A, Thr649.B, Leu646.B and Asn669.A. Significant differences in magnitudes were observed in radius of gyration, root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation, which confirms a reasonably more flexible state in the apo conformation associated with it dimerization. In contrast, the bound conformer of Hsp90 showed less flexibility. This visibly highpoints the inhibition process resulting from the binding of the ligand. These findings were further validated by principal component analysis. We believe that the detailed dynamic analyses of Hsp90 presented in this study, would give an imperative insight and better understanding to the function and mechanisms of inhibition. Furthermore, information obtained from the binding mode of the inhibitor would be of great assistance in the design of more potent inhibitors against the HIV target Hsp90.

The outcomes and additional risks of performing APSO for the correction of concurrent sagittal-coronal deformity have yet to be adequately studied. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of all ASD patients who underwent 3CO during the period from 2006 to 2019. All cases involved either isolated sagittal deformity (patients underwent standard PSO) or concurrent sagittal-coronal deformity (coronal vertical axis [CVA] &#8805; 4.0 cm; patients underwent APSO). Perioperative and 2-year follow-up outcomes were compared between patients with isolated sagittal imbalance who underwent PSO and those with concurrent sagittal-coronal imbalance who underwent APSO. RESULTS: A total of 390 patients were included: 338 who underwent PSO and 52 who underwent APSO. The mean patient age was 64.6 years, and 65.1% of patients were female. APSO patients required significantly more fusions with upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) in the upper thoracic spine (63.5% vs 43.3%, p = 0.007). Radiographically, APSO patients had greater deformity with more severe preoperative sagittal and coronal imbalance: sagittal vertical axis (SVA) 13.0 versus 10.7 cm (p = 0.042) and CVA 6.1 versus 1.2 cm (p < 0.001). In APSO cases, significant correction and normalization were achieved (SVA 13.0-3.1 cm, CVA 6.1-2.0 cm, lumbar lordosis [LL] 26.3-49.4, pelvic tilt [PT] 38.0-20.4, and scoliosis 25.0-10.4, p < 0.001). The overall perioperative complication rate was 34.9%. There were no significant differences between PSO and APSO patients in rates of complications (overall 33.7% vs 42.3%, p = 0.227; neurological 5.9% vs 3.9%, p = 0.547; medical 20.7% vs 25.0%, p = 0.482; and surgical 6.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.191, respectively). However, the APSO group required significantly longer stays in the ICU (3.1 vs 2.3 days, p = 0.047) and hospital (10.8 vs 8.3 days, p = 0.002). At the 2-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in mechanical complications, including proximal junctional kyphosis (p = 0.352), pseudarthrosis (p = 0.980), rod fracture (p = 0.852), and reoperation (p = 0.600). CONCLUSIONS: ASD patients with significant coronal imbalance often have severe concurrent sagittal deformity. APSO is a powerful and effective technique to achieve multiplanar correction without higher risk of morbidity and complications compared with PSO for sagittal imbalance. However, APSO is associated with slightly longer ICU and hospital stays.","output":"Asymmetrical pedicle subtraction osteotomy for correction of concurrent sagittal-coronal imbalance in adult spinal deformity: a comparative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to food remains a critical issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, 24.1% of its population suffers from undernourishment, and malnutrition affects more than a third of children under five years old. This problem will be exacerbated as the Sub-Saharan African population is predicted to double by 2050. To address this problem, it is imperative to meaningfully improve accessibility of fruits and vegetables for the population.They are an excellent source of vitamins and minerals that can fight malnutrition. Fruit and vegetable accessibility can be improved by reducing losses, which are estimated on average to be 50%. A literature review shows that there are many areas where solutions can be implemented to reduce these losses. These areas, in order of decreasing occurrence in the literature are: Cold storage, harvesting methods and pre-storage treatments, packaging, transport to markets and the sale stage. The reduction of food waste in SSA involves the establishment of better practices in all these areas. After analysis, it emerges that packaging should generate more interest due to its comparative ease of implementation to support other technologies like cold storage. Packaging made from agricultural waste or non-consumable materials should be highlighted to prevent pollution issues.

Previous studies have shown that closure of mesenteric defects after LRYGB may reduce the incidence of internal herniation. However, controversy remains as to whether mesenteric defect closure is necessary to decrease the incidence of internal hernias after LRYGB. This study aims to determine if jejeunal mesenteric defect closure reduces incidence of internal hernias and other complications in patients undergoing LRYGB. METHODS 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic antecolic RYGB were randomized into two groups: closed mesenteric defect (n = 50) or open mesenteric defect (n = 55). Complication rates were obtained from the medical record. Patients were followed up to 3 years post-operatively. Patients also completed the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GI QoL) pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively. Outcome measures included: incidence of internal hernias, complications, readmissions, reoperations, GI QoL scores, and percent excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS Pre-operatively, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The closed group had a longer operative time (closed-153 min, open-138 min, p = 0.073). There was one internal hernia in the open group. There was no significant difference at 12 months for decrease in BMI (closed-15.9, open-16.3 kg/m(2), p = 0.288) or %EWL (closed-75.3%, open-69.0%, p = 0.134). There was no significant difference between the groups in incidence of internal hernias and general complications post-operatively. Both groups showed significantly improved GI QoL index scores from baseline to 12 months post-surgery, but there were no significant differences at 12 months between groups in total GI QoL (closed-108, open-112, p = 0.440). CONCLUSIONS In this study, closure or non-closure of the jejeunal mesenteric defect following LRYGB appears to result in equivalent internal hernia and complication rates.

Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.","output":"De novo design of modular and tunable allosteric biosensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cessation of continuous analgesia and sedation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) facilitates early extubation, family, patient and provider engagement, and mobility.

In vivo exposure to chronic mild normobaric hypoxia (10 % oxygen) leads to a number of endogenous adaptations that includes vascular remodeling (angioplasticity). Angioplasticity promotes tissue survival. We have previously shown that induction of adaptive angioplasticity modulates the disease pattern in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the present study, we define mechanisms by which adaptation to low oxygen functionally ameliorates the signs and symptoms of EAE and for the first time show that tissue hypoxia may fundamentally alter neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG, and some of them were kept in the hypoxia chambers (day 0) and exposed to 10 % oxygen for 3 weeks, while the others were kept at normoxic environment. Sham-immunized controls were included in both hypoxic and normoxic groups. Animals were sacrificed at pre-clinical and peak disease periods for tissue collection and analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to mild hypoxia decreased histological evidence of inflammation. Decreased numbers of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ T cells were found in the hypoxic spinal cords associated with a delayed Th17-specific cytokine response. Hypoxia-induced changes did not alter the sensitization of peripheral T cells to the MOG peptide. Exposure to mild hypoxia induced significant increases in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels and an increase in the number of spinal cord CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells.

Summary Introduction COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing a major reorganization of health systems and a significant impact on many people's daily activities by lockdown mandates. The aim of our study is to compare the characteristics of the autopsies performed during the complete French lockdown in 2020 to the same period the preceding year. Material and methods We analysed all the medico-legal autopsies performed in Toulouse and Grenoble, two French forensic institutes from March 17 to May 11 in 2020 (period of the complete French Lockdown) compared to the same period of 2019. The main objective was to evaluate to difference in the number of autopsies performed. The secondary aims were to compare the characteristics of these autopsies: violent death, types of violent death, scene examination report, putrefied body, place of death, age, and sex. Results In total, 200 medico-legal autopsies were performed in 2019, 95 in 2020 during the reporting period. Weekly number of autopsies was 25 (SD=6.8) in 2019 and 12.5 (SD=3.5) in 2020 (P<0.001). No significant difference was found concerning the secondary aims except for two criteria with very low population (deaths in retirement homes and attacks). Conclusion Number of autopsies was divided by two during the lockdown compared to the control period year without modification of the other characteristics of the autopsies.

The initial stage of CVDs is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, defined as the limited bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Thus, any factors that interfere with the synthesis or metabolism of NO in endothelial cells are involved in CVD pathogenesis. It is well established that hypoxia is both the triggering factor as well as the accompanying factor in cardiovascular disease, and diminished tissue oxygen levels have been reported to influence endothelial NO bioavailability. In endothelial cells, NO is produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) from L-Arg, with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) as an essential cofactor. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which hypoxia affects NO bioavailability, including regulation of eNOS expression and activity. What is particularly important is the fact that hypoxia contributes to the depletion of cofactor BH(4) and deficiency of substrate L-Arg, and thus elicits eNOS uncouplinga state in which the enzyme produces superoxide instead of NO. eNOS uncoupling and the resulting oxidative stress is the major driver of endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Moreover, hypoxia induces impairment in mitochondrial respiration and endothelial cell activation; thus, oxidative stress and inflammation, along with the hypoxic response, contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction.","output":"Endothelial Dysfunction Driven by HypoxiaThe Influence of Oxygen Deficiency on NO Bioavailability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To flatten the curve of COVID-19 contagion, several countries ordered lockdowns amid the pandemic along with indications on social distancing.

We addressed these questions by conducting a longitudinal study with 146 Portuguese college studentsregular binge drinkers (regular BDs), infrequent binge drinkers (infrequent BDs) and non-binge drinkers (non-BDs)in three moments: before the pandemic (Pre-Lockdown), during lockdown (Lockdown) and 6 months after (Post-Lockdown). Results revealed that regular BDs decreased alcohol use during Lockdown, a change in behavior that was even greater during Post-Lockdown, when regular BDs displayed similar levels of consumption to infrequent/non-BDs. Additionally, alcohol craving and living with friends were predictive of alcohol use during Lockdown, whereas stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms did not contribute to explain changes in drinking behavior. Collectively, the results suggest that BD in young Portuguese college students can be stopped when the contexts in which alcohol intake usually takes place are suppressed, which may have important implications for future prevention and intervention strategies.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Mitigation Measures on Alcohol Consumption and Binge Drinking in College Students: A Longitudinal Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-read sequencing technologies have now reached a level of accuracy and yield that allows their application to variant detection at a scale of tens to thousands of samples.

RESULTS: Based on data collected, we generated a definition of BST and a list of suggested strategies to optimise BST, for example, preparation, safe learning environment, flexible teaching and patient's benefits.

Methods: A national dataset with the first 20,293 patients infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 21 April 2020 was analyzed. The primary outcome measure was mortality by COVID-19, measured (registered and confirmed) by Medical Doctors serving as health delegates on the daily death registry. A logistic regression model using a generalized linear model was used for estimating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each potential risk indicator. Results: A total of 502 infected patients died of COVID-19. The risk factors for increased odds of death by COVID-19 were: sex (male: OR = 1.47, ref = female), age ((56C60) years, OR = 6.01; (61C65) years, OR = 10.5; (66C70) years, OR = 20.4; (71C75) years, OR = 34; (76C80) years, OR = 50.9; (81C85) years, OR = 70.7; (86C90) years, OR = 83.2; (91C95) years, OR = 91.8; (96C104) years, OR = 140.2, ref = (0C55)), Cardiac disease (OR = 2.86), Kidney disorder (OR = 2.95), and Neuromuscular disorder (OR = 1.58), while condition (None (absence of precondition); OR = 0.49) was associated with a reduced chance of dying after adjusting for other variables of interest. Conclusions: Besides age and sex, preconditions justify the risk difference in mortality by COVID-19.","output":"The Role of Health Preconditions on COVID-19 Deaths in Portugal: Evidence from Surveillance Data of the First 20293 Infection Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemicin terms of climate, economy and social aspectscannot yet be fully assessed, but we can already see how the pandemic is intensifying already existing socio-economic inequalities.

In this article, our goal is to identify the linguistic constructions of elderly citizens in Swedish mass media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 from a sociological and corpus linguistics perspective. More specifically, our aim is to explore the discursive formations of the elderly in Swedish media during the pandemic and how these formations relate to risk as well as the discursive constructions of in- and out-groups. Drawing on corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS), inspired by discourseChistorical analysis (DHA), we examine the media coverage of COVID-19 by three Swedish newspapers published during 2020: Aftonbladet, a national tabloid;Svenska Dagbladet, a national morning newspaper;and Dalademokraten, a regional morning newspaper. In this article, the news articles and their messages are considered performative to the extent thatfor example, at the same time as a story is expressedthe elderly are at risk of becoming seriously ill due to COVID-19;moreover, a position of vulnerability for the elderly is simultaneously created. The result reveals that the elderly were constructed as an at-risk group, while visitors, personnel and nursing homes were constructed as being risky or a threat to the elderly.","output":"The Language of Risk and Vulnerability in Covering the COVID-19 Pandemic in Swedish Mass Media in 2020: Implications for the Sustainable Management of Elderly Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and evolution of mild dilatation confined to the renal pelvis in term neonates with urinary tract infection developing within 2 weeks from birth.

METHODS A search of a national insurance claims database was performed to identify all patients who underwent ACLR from 2007 to 2017, who were active within the database at a minimum of 6 months prior to and 18 months after their surgery. The primary outcome studied was a subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis, manipulation under anesthesia and arthrolysis (MUA/LOA). Patients who filled a prescription for aspirin, low-molecular weight heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, fondaparinux, and warfarin within 2 days after their surgery were included and those who filled a prescription within 3 months prior to surgery were excluded. Thromboprophylaxis status was defined as no thromboprophylaxis, aspirin, and any agent other than aspirin. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between prophylaxis status and MUA/LOA RESULTS: Of the 14,081 patients in our final surgical population, 191 patients had MUA /LOA and 13890 patients did not. 499 patients were prescribed pharmacologic prophylaxis. Rates of MUA/LOA across groups were 1.3% in the group with no thromboprophylaxis, 1.9% in the group prescribed aspirin, and 4.3% in the group prescribed any agent other than aspirin. Only the group prescribed an agent other than aspirin was significantly associated with subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-4.8, p=.004).

The Spine Society of Singapore convened via a teleconference on April 24, 2020 to collaborate on a national level and share collective wisdom in order to tackle the ongoing crisis. In the teleconference, 13 spine surgeons from across various hospitals in Singapore constituted the panel of experts. The following topics were discussed: repurposing of surgeons, continuity of spine services, introduction of telemedicine, triaging of spinal surgeries, preoperative testing, new challenges in performing spine surgery, and preparing for the post-pandemic era. While some issues required only the sharing of best practices, the Delphi panel method was adopted to form a consensus on others. Existing spine specific triage guidelines were debated and a locally accepted set of guidelines was established. Although preoperative testing is currently not performed routinely, the panel voted in favor of its implementation because they concluded that it is vital to protect themselves, their colleagues, and their patients. Solutions to operating room specific concerns were also discussed. This article reflects the opinions and insights shared during this meeting and reviews the evidence relevant to the issues that were raised. The rapid consensus reached during the teleconference has enabled us to be concerted, and thus stronger, in our national efforts to provide the best standard of care via our spine services in these challenging times.

It is described as predominant epigastric pain lasting for at least one month. Globally, peptic ulcer disease occurs in 3.5C32% of patients with dyspepsia. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/aspirin use are the widely known risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. There was no recent document on H. pylori infection rate among patients with peptic ulcer disease in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine magnitude and associated factors of peptic ulcer disease among dyspeptic patients in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 218 study subjects. A pre-designed semi-structured questionnaire was used to extract clinical information. Olympus flexible fiber-optic endoscope (Olympus, GIF-E 600, Olympus Corp., Hamburg, Germany) was used to confirm the presence of peptic ulcer disease. Diagnosis of active H. pylori infection was made using the fecal H. pylori Antigen 25 T Card Test (Anamol Lab., Pvt. Ltd., Palghar, India). The Data were entered into EPI Info version 4.6.0.2, and then exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Explanatory variables associated with peptic ulcer disease were analyzed by applying logistic regression model. P value < 0.05 was used to declare significant association. RESULT: A total of 218 dyspeptic patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations were included in the study. The mean (+ SD) age of patients was 42  16.4 years. Forty nine percent (95% CI 42.4C56.2) of dyspeptic patients had active H. pylori infection. Peptic ulcer disease was diagnosed in 35% (95% CI 31.4C39.2) of patients with dyspepsia.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the population aged 0C17 years. METHOD: A comprehensive search for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to November 9, 2021. All data were pooled by RevMan 5.3 statistical software, with risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval as the effect measure. This study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021290205). RESULTS: There was a total of six randomized controlled trials included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, enrolling participants in the age range of 3C17 years, and containing three types of COVID-19 vaccines. Compared with mRNA vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines have a more satisfactory safety profile, both after initial (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04C1.90, P = 0.03) and booster (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.20C2.81, P = 0.005) vaccination. The risk of adverse reactions was significantly increased after the first and second doses, but there was no significant difference between the first two doses (RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.99C1.02, P = 0.60). Nevertheless, the two-dose regimen is obviously superior to the single-dose schedule for immunogenicity and efficacy. After booster vaccination, both neutralizing antibodies (RR 144.80, 95%CI 44.97C466.24, P < 0.00001) and RBD-binding antibodies (RR 101.50, 95%CI 6.44C1,600.76, P = 0.001) reach optimal levels, but the cellular immune response seemed not to be further enhanced. In addition, compared with younger children, older children and adolescents were at significantly increased risk of adverse reactions after vaccination, with either mRNA or inactivated vaccines, accompanied by a stronger immune response. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines are acceptable in people aged 3C17 years. However, there is an urgent need for additional multicenter, large-sample studies, especially in younger children under 3 years of age and even in infants, with long-term follow-up data.

COVID-19 patients are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome and death from respiratory failure. Methods: In this study the complete genome of the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, geologically isolated types, and Coronavirus related to human diseases were compared by the Molecular Phylogenetic Maximum Likelihood method. The secondary and tertiary structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV were defined as the most similar viruses to SARS-CoV-2, aligned with chimera software. Therefore, considering ineffective antiviral medications used for SARS-CoV and the importance of preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome as the main cause of mortality, 2 strategies were adopted to acquire the most effective drug combination. Results: The results of phylogenic analysis showed that SARS-CoV is the most similar virus to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary structure and superimposing of tertiary structure did not show a significant difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 3C-like main protease and the root means square deviation between C atoms did not support the difference between the 2 protein structures. Thus, these 2 mechanisms were fostered in accordance with the correlation between acute respiratory distress syndrome-related Coronavirus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on one side and the possible treatments for reducing the respiratory side effects on the other. The analysis of renin-angiotensin system as well as the tested drugs applied to acute respiratory distress syndrome cases, indicated that angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and C21 as nonpeptide agonist might possess a promising modality of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, implementing recombinant human ACE2 as a competitive receptor might be an effective way to trap and chelate the SARS-CoV-2 particles. Conclusion: The data suggest that combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor blockers and C21 could be a potential pharmacologic regimen to control and reduce acute respiratory distress syndrome.

METHODS: We developed a tool (GNUVID) that integrates whole genome multilocus sequence typing and a supervised machine learning random forest-based classifier. We used GNUVID to assign sequence type (ST) profiles to each of 69,686 SARS-CoV-2 complete, high-quality genomes available from GISAID as of October 20(th) 2020. STs were then clustered into clonal complexes (CCs), and then used to train a machine learning classifier. We used this tool to detect potential introduction and exportation events, and to estimate effective viral diversity across locations and over time in 16 US states. RESULTS: GNUVID is a scalable tool for viral genotype classification (available at https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID) that can be used to quickly process tens of thousands of genomes. Our genotyping ST/CC analysis uncovered dynamic local changes in ST/CC prevalence and diversity with multiple replacement events in different states. We detected an average of 20.6 putative introductions and 7.5 exportations for each state. Effective viral diversity dropped in all states as shelter-in-place travel-restrictions went into effect and increased as restrictions were lifted. Interestingly, our analysis showed correlation between effective diversity and the date that state-wide mask mandates were imposed. CONCLUSIONS: Our classification tool uncovered multiple introduction and exportation events, as well as waves of expansion and replacement of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in different states.

We develop a multi sector disequilibrium model with buyer-seller relations between agents located in different countries. The production network model allows us to study not only the direct cost of the lockdown but also indirect costs which emerge from the reductions in the availability of intermediate inputs. Agents determine the quantity of output and the proportions in which to combine inputs using prices that emerge from local interactions. The model is calibrated to the world economy using input-output data on 56 industries in 44 countries including all major economies. Within our model, the lockdowns are implemented as partial reductions in the output of some sectors using data on sectoral decomposition of capacity reductions. We use computational experiments to replicate the temporal sequence of the lockdowns implemented in different countries. World output falls by 7% at the early stage of the crisis when only China is under lockdown and by 23% at the peak of the crisis when many countries are under a lockdown. These direct impacts are amplified as the shock propagates through the world economy because of the buyer-seller relations. Supply-chain spillovers are capable of amplifying the direct impact by more than two folds. Naturally, the substitutability between intermediate inputs is a major determinant of the amplification. We also study the process of economic recovery following the end of the lockdowns. Price flexibility and minor technological adaptations help in reducing the time it takes for the economy to recover. The world economy takes about one quarter to move towards the new equilibrium in the optimistic and unlikely scenario of the end of all lockdowns.

Quantitative attributes can be thought as attributes determining the Quality of Service C QoS provided by a software component published as a service. In this sense, they play a determinant role in classifying software artifacts according to specific needs stated as requirements. In previous works we presented an efficient, and fully automatic, analysis technique for establishing Service Level Agreements C SLA. Such a proposal relays on describing QoS contracts as convex specifications, and compliance checking is performed by the application of an analysis algorithm based on state of the art techniques used in hybrid system verification.

In this work we propose and implement a metric for automatically quantifying partial satisfaction of QoS requirements, leading to a way of ranking services according to such notion of partial compliance.","output":"Quality of Service Ranking by Quantifying Partial Compliance of Requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has required conserving capacity and resources to avoid the health sector being overwhelmed. This paper describes Geelong's general surgical response, surgical activity, outcomes and the effect on surgical training. METHODS: Data collected from surgical audits; hospital databases and patient's medical records were used to compare the first 7 weeks of our new service delivery (30 March to 17 May 2020) to the corresponding 7 weeks in 2019 (1 April 2019 to 19 May 2019). All surgical cases, morbidity and mortality were discussed at weekly surgical audit meetings conducted by videoconference. Treatment performance indicators were tested by chi-squared test for proportions, and by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Elective general surgery decreased by 45.9% but an essential service was maintained by substantially increasing our public in private operating to perform 81 cases. Despite a 30% decrease in emergency department presentations, general surgery admissions decreased only 6.1% while emergency operations increased 13.9%. We used telehealth to conduct 81.3% of outpatient appointments and 61.8% of pre-operative anaesthetic reviews. No significant differences were found for overall surgical outcomes, including appendicectomy (perforation rates) and laparotomy (length of stay and morbidity). Operative exposure for trainees was maintained. CONCLUSION: Geelong was able to provide a safe and effective general surgery service during the first 7 weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

European research on anxiety and stress among hospital workers during the pandemic is limited. This study aimed to describe the anxiety levels of Finnish hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The multidimensional, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all hospital staff working at two Finnish specialized medical care centres in the spring of 2020 (n = 1,995). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale was used to measure the workers anxiety. RESULTS: The total mean GAD-7 score was 4.88, indicating normal anxiety levels. However, 30% (n = 1,079) of the respondents had mild, 10% (n = 194) moderate and 5% (n = 88) severe anxiety. Key risk factors were young age, working in a university hospital, problems in cooperation between co-workers, difficulty concentrating at work, a health-threatening physical and psychological workload, and a fear of being infected at work. CONCLUSION: Hospital staff experienced a variety of work-related stress and anxiety issues that should be visible to hospital administrators and policymakers alike. The anxiety is independent of whether the worker is directly involved in caring for or in any way coming into contact with COVID-19 patients. KEY MESSAGE: Fifty-five percent of hospital staff have normal anxiety levels. The remaining workers may need targeted support interventions, and a smaller proportion (15%) are in danger of developing longer-term problems affecting their well-being. The anxiety experienced by hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than that of the population on average. If the pandemic continues, the well-being of hospital staff may be widely threatened. Despite the different geographical locations and COVID-19 situations, hospital workers in Finland and China had similar anxiety levels. The anxiety is independent of whether staff are working in the front line of managing the COVID-19 pandemic or of the number of covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The hospital workers felt anxiety because they were facing a new situation which causes changes in their work and daily routine. Health care employers should engage in long-term follow-up as regards the personnels recovery from the burden caused by the pandemic and from work in general.

Therefore, we tested a set of Strepsils(?) lozenges, containing either HR (Max [#2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [#3], Extra Strong [#4], Warm [#5], Orange and Vitamin C [#6], Sugar free Lemon [#7], Children/Strawberry [#8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [#9]) for their antiviral efficiency against representatives of respiratory viruses known to cause sore throat: human rhinovirus (HRV) 1a, HRV8, influenza virus A H1N1n, Coxsackievirus A10, and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43. The lozenges were tested head to head with Coldamaris(?) lozenges (#1), which contain the patented antiviral iota-carrageenan. None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges shows any antiviral effectiveness against HRV8 at the tested concentrations, whereas all are moderately active against HRV1a. Only lozenge #5 shows any activity against hCoV OC43 and Coxsackievirus A10 at the tested concentrations. Similarly, only lozenge #3 is moderately active against influenza A H1N1n virus. The data indicates that neither the isolated effect of the active ingredients nor the pH but rather one or more of the excipients of the specific formulations are responsible for the antiviral effect of some of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges. In contrast, carrageenan-containing lozenges are highly active against all viruses tested. In another experiment, we showed that binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective. During the residence time of the lozenge in the mouth, the viral titer is reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza A virus and hCoV OC43, respectively.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hospital-based study in China. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with COVID-19 from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020. END POINT: Disease severity and mortality. METHODS: Clinical data of 638 patients with COVID-19 were collected and compared between severe and non-severe groups. The predictive ability of laboratory indicators in disease progression and prognosis of COVID-19 was analysed using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The survival differences of COVID-19 patients with different levels of laboratory indicators were analysed utilising Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: 29.8% (190/638) of patients with COVID-19 progressed to severe. Compared with patients with no adverse events, C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer were significantly higher in severe patients with adverse events, such as acute myocardial injury, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes and death (all p<0.05). The multivariate logistic analysis suggested that CRP, NLR and D-dimer were independent risk factors for the disease progression of COVID-19 (all p<0.05). The model combining all of them owned the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) predicting disease progression and death of COVID-19, with AUC of 0.894 (95% CI 0.857 to 0.931) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.873 to 0.962), respectively. Survival analysis suggested that the patients with a high level of CRP, NLR or D-dimer performed shorter overall survival time (all p<0.05).

These channels facilitate microaspiration of subglottic secretions, which is the main pathogenic mechanism leading to intubation-related pneumonia. Ultrathin polyurethane (PU)-cuffed ETTs are developed to minimize channel formation in the cuff wall and therefore the risk of microaspiration and respiratory infections. METHODS We systematically reviewed the available literature for laboratory and clinical studies comparing fluid leakage or microaspiration and/or rates of respiratory infections between ETTs with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cuffs and ETTs with PU cuffs. RESULTS The literature search revealed nine in vitro experiments, one in vivo (animal) experiment, and five clinical studies. Among the 9 in vitro studies, 10 types of PU-cuffed ETTs were compared with 17 types of PVC-cuffed tubes, accounting for 67 vs. 108 experiments with 36 PU-cuffed tubes and 42 PVC-cuffed tubes, respectively. Among the clinical studies, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that involved 708 patients. In this review, we provide evidence that PU cuffs protect more efficiently than PVC cuffs against fluid leakage or microaspiration. All studies with leakage and/or microaspiration as the primary outcome demonstrated significantly less leakage (eight in vitro and two clinical studies) or at least a tendency toward more efficient sealing (one in vivo animal experiment). In particular, high-risk patients intubated for shorter periods may benefit from the more effective sealing capacity afforded by PU cuffs. For example, cardiac surgery patients experienced a lower risk of early postoperative pneumonia in one RCT. The evidence that PU-cuffed tubes prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is less robust, probably because microaspiration is postponed rather than eliminated. One RCT demonstrated no difference in VAP risk between patients intubated with either PU-cuffed or PVC-cuffed tubes, and one before-after trial demonstrated a favorable reduction in VAP rates following the introduction of PU-cuffed tubes. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence can support the use of PU-cuffed ETTs in high-risk surgical patients, while there is only very limited evidence that PU cuffs prevent pneumonia in patients ventilated for prolonged periods.","output":"The value of polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tubes to reduce microaspiration and intubation-related pneumonia: a systematic review of laboratory and clinical studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence of the impacts of corporate food systems on peoples health raised concerns about the multiple outcomes of malnutrition and climate change, including commodities production and high consumption of ultra-processed food products.

We tested the hypothesis that increased inflammation in COVID-19 precedes coma, independent of medications, hypotension, and hypoxia. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 3203 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 2 through July 30, 2020, in New York City with the Glasgow Coma Scale and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) scores. We applied hazard ratio (HR) modeling and mediation analysis to determine the risk of SIRS score elevation to precede coma, accounting for confounders. RESULTS: We obtained behavioral assessments in 3203 of 10,797 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those patients, 1054 (32.9%) were comatose, which first developed on median hospital day 2 (interquartile range [IQR] 1C9). During their hospital stay, 1538 (48%) had a SIRS score of 2 or above at least once, and the median maximum SIRS score was 2 (IQR 1C2). A fivefold increased risk of coma (HR 5.05, 95% confidence interval 4.27C5.98) was seen for each day that patients with COVID-19 had elevated SIRS scores, independent of medication effects, hypotension, and hypoxia. The overall mortality in this population was 13.8% (n = 441). Coma was associated with death (odds ratio 7.77, 95% confidence interval 6.29C9.65) and increased length of stay (13 days [IQR 11.9C14.1] vs. 11 [IQR 9.6C12.4]), accounting for demographics.

We aimed to investigate if healthcare workers with history of weak immune response to HBV vaccination are more likely to have weak responses against the BioNTech/Pfizers BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: We prospectively tested 954 healthcare workers for the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein antibody titers prior to the first and second BNT162b2 vaccination doses and after four weeks after the second dose using Roches Elecsys(?) assay. We calculated the percentage of patients who seroconverted after the first and second doses. We estimated the relative risk of non-seroconversion after the first BNT162b2 vaccine (defined as anti-SARS-CoV-2-S titer <15 U/mL) among HBV vaccine non-responders (HBs-Ab titer <10 mIU/mL) and weak responders (10 and <100 mIU/mL) compared to normal responders (100 mIU/mL). RESULTS: Among 954 healthcare workers recruited between March 9 and March 24, 2021 at Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, weak and normal HBV vaccine responders had comparable S-protein titers after the first BNT162b2 dose (51.4 [95% confidence interval 25.2C137.0] versus 59.7 [29.8C138.0] U/mL, respectively). HBV vaccine non-responders were more likely than normal responders to not seroconvert after a single dose (age and sex-adjusted relative risk 1.85 95% confidence interval [1.10C3.13]) although nearly all participants seroconverted after the second dose. After limiting the analysis to 382 patients with baseline comorbidity data, the comorbidity-adjusted relative risk of non-seroconversion among HBV vaccine non-responders to normal responders was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [0.59C2.98]).

Coronaviruses have led to multidimensional consequences on health, mobility, and socio-economic conditions. Despite the significance and magnitude of impact from epidemics to the pandemic, literature is sparse on comprehensive coronaviruses related research performance over time. This study aimed at a scientometric evaluation of coronaviruses related literature including COVID-19. Data related to Coronavirus research was extracted from the Web of Science (WoS). All types of publications (28846) were included and retrieved. To measure the quantity and quality of the publications, R-Bibliometrix package was used for detailed analysis exploring a wide range of indicators. Generally, an increasing trend was observed over time led by the USA and China followed by the United Kingdom, Europe, and few other developed countries. The last two decades contributed around 39.5 % of documents while only 06 months of 2020 additionally contributed around 46.5 % of total documents. Earlier shorter spikes of increased post epidemic publications followed by decreased productivity were detected in the last 2 decades and showed a lack of continuity - a research epidemic following a disease epidemic. Articles (53.4 %) were the most common publication type. Journal of Virology, British Medical Journal (BMJ), and Virology were leading sources while BMJ, and Lancet showed increased contributions recently. Overall, similar trends of top authors were observed in terms of productivity, impact, collaborations, funding sources, and affiliations with few exceptions mainly from affected regions. Top 20 countries contributed >89% of documents suggesting a lack of global efforts.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of the children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 26 to March 5, 2020. The children were divided into an asymptomatic group with 41 children and a symptomatic group with 73 children. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of different antiviral regimens (monotherapy, double therapy, or triple therapy) and whether interferon -1b was used in combination with azithromycin on the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. RESULTS A total of 114 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (72 boys and 42 girls) were enrolled. The median age of the children was 7.1 years. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 6 days. In either group, the subgroup analysis showed no significance differences in the length of hospital stay and the clearance time of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid between the subgroups treated with different combinations of antiviral drugs and the subgroups treated with interferon -1b alone or in combination with azithromycin (P > 0.05).

The present study aimed to assess the Saudi public's intent to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and explore the associated demographic determinants of their intentions as well as the reasons for vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to public individuals in Saudi Arabia between 25 December 2020 and 15 February 2021. Participants were asked if they were willing to get vaccinated, and the responses, along with demographic data were entered into a multinomial logistic regression model to assess the relative risk ratio (RRR) for responding \\"no\\" or \\"unsure\\" versus \\"yes\\". Among 3048 participants (60.1% female, 89.5% Saudi), 52.9% intend to get vaccinated, 26.8% were unsure, and 20.3% refused vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly higher among females (RRR = 2.70, p < 0.0001) and those who had not been recently vaccinated for influenza (RRR = 2.63, p < 0.0001). The likelihood was lower among Saudis (RRR = 0.49, p < 0.0001), those with less than a secondary education (RRR = 0.16, p < 0.0001), perceived risks of COVID-19, and residents of the southern region (RRR = 0.46, p < 0.0001). The most often cited reasons for hesitancy were short clinical testing periods and concerns about adverse events or effectiveness. Vaccine hesitancy is mediated by many demographic factors and personal beliefs.

As virus isolation has not been successful yet, we have here studied the functionality of the authentic ATFLV- and ALLV-encoded glycoproteins in the context of rabies virus pseudotype particles. Cryogenic electron microscopy uncovered the incorporation of the plasmid-encoded G proteins in viral envelopes. Infection experiments revealed the infectivity of ATFLV and ALLV G-coated RABV pp for a broad spectrum of cell lines from humans, bats, and reptiles, demonstrating membrane fusion activities. As presumed, ATFLV and ALLV G RABV pp escaped neutralization by human rabies immune sera.

A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multigroup study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS CoV 2 (n=145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID 19 (i.e. healthy blood donors, n=191, and healthcare workers, n=1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) (n=9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n=7) and endemic common cold coronavirus infections (n=12) taken prior to the current SARS CoV 2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers cutoffs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval,[84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA).

Cases with aerosol producing procedures are isolated to a few ORs, initial phase I recovery of those patients is in the ORs, and multimodal environmental decontamination applied. We quantified the potential increase in productivity from also resequencing these cases among those 2 or 3 ORs. Design Computer simulation provided sample sizes requiring >100 years experimentally. Resequencing was limited to changes in the start times of surgeons' lists of cases. Setting Ambulatory surgery center or hospital outpatient department. Main results With case resequencing applied before and on the day of surgery, there were 5.6% and 5.5% more cases per OR per day for the 2 ORs and 3 ORs, respectively, both standard errors (SE) < 0.1%. Resequencing cases among ORs to start cases earlier permitted increases in the hours into which cases could be scheduled from 10.5 to 11.0 h, while assuring >90% probability of each OR finishing within the prespecified 12-h shift. Thus, the additional cases were all scheduled before the day of surgery. The greater allocated time also resulted in less overutilized time, a mean of 4.2 min per OR per day for 2 ORs (SE 0.5) and 6.3 min per OR per day for 3 ORs (SE 0.4). The benefit could be achieved while limiting application of resequencing to days when the OR with the fewest estimated hours of cases has 8 h. Conclusions Some ambulatory surgery ORs have unusually long OR times and/or room cleanup times (e.g., infection control efforts because of the pandemic). Resequencing cases before and on the day of surgery should be considered, because moving 1 or 2 cases occasionally has little to no cost with substantive benefit.","output":"Caseload is increased by resequencing cases before and on the day of surgery at ambulatory surgery centers where initial patient recovery is in operating rooms and cleanup times are longer than typical"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is a respiratory disease that spreads globally.

METHODS AND RESULTS We selected two disinfectant-antifreeze combinations, didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) - propylene glycol (PPG) and peracetic acid (PAA) - triethylene glycol (TEG) and each combination is used with a custom-optimized thermal fogging machine. The two fogs were tested in -20 C freezer warehouses for their disinfection efficacy against a coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field strain, a swine influenza virus (SIV) field strain, and three indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis endospores. At -20 C, the DDAB-PPG or PAA-TEG thermal fogs settle within 3.5 to 4.5 hours, and effectively inactivated PEDV with median tissue culture infective dose of 10-3.5 0.1 ml-1 and SIV-H1N1 with hemagglutination titer of 26 ml-1 within 15-60 min.

This study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other related factors such as resource availability and institutional support on well-being, burnout and job-satisfaction of EM physicians in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study of EM physicians was conducted through the Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network of the ACEP. The survey focused on resource adequacy, institutional support, well-being, and burnout. A total of 890 EM physicians were invited to participate. Both descriptive and risk adjusted, and multivariate regressions were performed with a statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: EM physicians' response rate was 18.7% (166) from 39 states. Burnout was reported by 74.7% (124) since the start of the pandemic. Factors contributing included work-related emotional strain and anxiety, isolation from family and friends, and increased workload. Those reporting inadequate resources felt ignored by their institutions (p < 0.0001). Physicians who felt there was inadequate institutional support, were also dissatisfied with patient care resources (p = 0.001). Physicians expressing job dissatisfaction were more likely to report feelings of burnout (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: EM physicians face greater burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be compounded by resource scarcity, psychological stress, isolation, and job dissatisfaction. Many of the survey respondents reported inadequate mental health services and resources.

However, previous studies in both finance and AI research fields only consider either the intra-risk or the conductive-risk, ignoring their interactions and their combinatorial effect for simplicity. This paper for the first time considers both risks simultaneously and their joint effect in bankruptcy prediction. Specifically, we first propose an enterprise intra-risk encoder with LSTM based on enterprise risk statistical significance indicators from its basic business information and litigation information for its intra-risk learning. Afterward, we propose an enterprise conductive-risk encoder based on enterprise relational information from the enterprise knowledge graph for its conductive-risk embedding. In particular, the conductive-risk encoder is equipped with both the newly proposed Hyper-Graph Neural Networks (Hyper-GNNs) and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (Heter-GNNs), which is able to model conductive-risk from two different aspects, i.e. common risk factors based on hyperedges and direct diffusion risk from the neighbors, respectively. With the two kinds of encoders, a unified framework is designed to simultaneously capture intra-risk and conductive-risk for bankruptcy prediction. To evaluate our model, we collect multi-sources SMEs real-world data and build a novel benchmark dataset SMEsD.

METHODS All mass spectra were collected on an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer in positive mode. Theoretical calculations were carried out by the density functional theory method at the B3LYP level with a hybrid basis set consisting of 6-31G(d,p) and LANL2DZ in the Gaussian 03 program. RESULTS When the ruthenated [15 ]Paracyclophanes (Ru-[15 ]PCPs) and Ru (II)-arene dimers were dissolved in the alkyl alcohol solvents, the adducts of alkoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations were observed under positive ion mode ESI-MS, which were resulted from the coordination of alkyl alcohol molecules with Ru (II)-arene cations followed by the deprotonation of O-H bond on the coordinated alcohols. Furthermore, the number of alkoxides binding to Ru-[15 ]PCPs was regulated by the number of ruthenium atoms. Attributed to good solubility and small steric hindrance, the intensity of the adducts of methoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations was the strongest among three alkyl alcohols used in this study.

We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common.

Despite its severity and prevalence, treatment options are limited. In light of accumulating evidence that mitochondrial abnormalities are common in ARF, here we applied broad spectrum quantitative and semiquantitative metabolomic analyses of serum from ARF patients to detect bioenergetic dysfunction and determine its association with survival. Plasma samples from surviving and non-surviving patients (N = 15/group) were taken at day 1 and day 3 after admission to the medical intensive care unit and, in survivors, at hospital discharge. Significant differences between survivors and non-survivors (ANOVA, 5% FDR) include bioenergetically relevant intermediates of redox cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NAD phosphate (NADP), increased acyl-carnitines, bile acids, and decreased acyl-glycerophosphocholines. Many metabolites associated with poor outcomes are substrates of NAD(P)-dependent enzymatic processes, while alterations in NAD cofactors rely on bioavailability of dietary B-vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine. Changes in the efficiency of the nicotinamide-derived cofactors biosynthetic pathways also associate with alterations in glutathione-dependent drug metabolism characterized by substantial differences observed in the acetaminophen metabolome. Based on these findings, a four-feature model developed with semi-quantitative and quantitative metabolomic results predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.91). Collectively, this metabolomic endotype points to a close association between mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction and mortality in human ARF, thus pointing to new pharmacologic targets to reduce mortality in this condition.","output":"A metabolomic endotype of bioenergetic dysfunction predicts mortality in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The literature suggests that COVID-19 provokes arterial and venous thrombotic events, although the mechanism is still unknown In this study, we describe patients with confirmed coronavirus infection associated with multisystemic infarction, focusing on splenic infarction More data are required to elucidate how COVID-19 and thrombotic disease interact and so that preventive and early diagnosis strategies can be developed LEARNING POINTS: Thrombotic disease as a complication of COVID-19 must be suspected by clinicians, and recognized and monitored by radiologists Thrombosis is often the initial manifestation of SARS-CoV-2, hence the importance of early diagnosis to avoid complications and reduce morbidity and mortality","output":"Multisystemic Infarctions in COVID-19: Focus on the Spleen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, COVID-19 is a global pandemic that scientists and engineers around the world are aiming to understand further through rigorous testing and observation This paper aims to provide safe distance recommendations among individuals and minimize the spread of COVID-19, as well as examine the efficacy of face coverings as a tool to slow the spread of respiratory droplets These studies are conducted using computational fluid dynamics analyses, where the infected person breathes, coughs, and sneezes at various distances and environmental wind conditions and while wearing a face-covering (mask or face shield) In cases where there were no wind conditions, the breathing and coughing simulations display 1-2 m physical distancing to be effective However, when sneezing was introduced, the physical distancing recommendation of 2 m was deemed not effective;instead, a distance of 2 8 m and greater was found to be more effective in reducing the exposure to respiratory droplets The evaluation of environmental wind conditions necessitated an increase in physical distancing measures in all cases The case where breathing was measured with a gentle breeze resulted in a physical distancing recommendation of 1 1 m, while coughing caused a change from the previous recommendation of 2 m to a distance of 4 5 m or greater Sneezing in the presence of a gentle breeze was deemed to be the most impactful, with a recommendation for physical distancing of 5 8 m or more It was determined that face coverings can potentially provide protection to an uninfected person in static air conditions However, the uninfected person's protection can be compromised even in gentle wind conditions ? 2021 Author(s)","output":"Assessment of effectiveness of optimum physical distancing phenomena for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of drug-induced anaphylaxis (AN) using the Japanese nationwide database has not been reported, even though drugs are a common trigger of AN.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding drug-induced adverse events between April 2004 and February 2018 published in JADER by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. We analyzed cases of anaphylaxis occurring between January 2005 and December 2017. The drug classification was based on the Japanese Standard Commodity Classification. RESULTS: There were 16916 cases of anaphylaxis reported during the study period. Among them, 418 fatalities were registered. The incidence of drug-induced AN and fatal cases was 1.03 cases/year per 100000 population and 0.03 cases/year, respectively. The most frequent causes of AN were diagnostic agents including X-ray contrast media (20.3%) and biological agents including human blood preparations (20.1%). In fatal cases, diagnostic agents (28.7%) and antibiotics (23.9%) were the most frequent causes.

Detecting lung malignancies promptly is essential for any anticancer treatment to reduce mortality and morbidity, especially in high-risk individuals. The use of liquid biopsy to detect circulating biomarkers such as RNA, microRNA, DNA, proteins, autoantibodies in the blood, as well as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), can substantially change the way we manage lung cancer patients by improving disease stratification using intrinsic molecular characteristics, identification of therapeutic targets and monitoring molecular residual disease. Here, we made an update on recent developments in liquid biopsy-based biomarkers for lung cancer early diagnosis, and we propose guidelines for an accurate study design, execution, and data interpretation for biomarker development. ABSTRACT: Lung cancer burden is increasing, with 2 million deaths/year worldwide. Current limitations in early detection impede lung cancer diagnosis when the disease is still localized and thus more curable by surgery or multimodality treatment. Liquid biopsy is emerging as an important tool for lung cancer early detection and for monitoring therapy response. Here, we reviewed recent advances in liquid biopsy for early diagnosis of lung cancer. We summarized DNA- or RNA-based biomarkers, proteins, autoantibodies circulating in the blood, as well as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and compared the most promising studies in terms of biomarkers prediction performance. While we observed an overall good performance for the proposed biomarkers, we noticed some critical aspects which may complicate the successful translation of these biomarkers into the clinical setting. We, therefore, proposed a roadmap for successful development of lung cancer biomarkers during the discovery, prioritization, and clinical validation phase. The integration of innovative minimally invasive biomarkers in screening programs is highly demanded to augment lung cancer early detection.","output":"Biomarkers and Lung Cancer Early Detection: State of the Art"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions has the potential to enhance chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to determine which mHealth features are required to potentially enhance COPD self-management. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the potential features of an mHealth intervention for COPD management with healthcare providers (HCPs) and patients with COPD. It could inform the development and successful implementation of mHealth interventions for COPD management. METHODS: This was a qualitative study. We conducted semi-structured individual interviews with HCPs, including nurses, pharmacists and physicians who work directly with patients with COPD. Interviews were also conducted with a diverse sample of patients with COPD. Interview topics included demographics, mHealth usage, the potential use of medical devices and recommendations for features that would enhance an mHealth intervention for COPD management. RESULTS: A total of 40 people, including nurses, physicians and pharmacists, participated. The main recommendations for the proposed mHealth intervention were categorised into two categories: patient interface and HCP interface. The prevalent features suggested for the patient interface include educating patients, collecting baseline data, collecting subjective data, collecting objective data via compatible medical devices, providing a digital action plan, allowing patients to track their progress, enabling family members to access the mHealth intervention, tailoring the features based on the patient's unique needs, reminding patients about critical management tasks and rewarding patients for their positive behaviours. The most common features of the HCP interface include allowing HCPs to track their patients' progress, allowing HCPs to communicate with their patients, educating HCPs and rewarding HCPs. CONCLUSION: This study identifies important potential features so that the most effective, efficient and feasible mHealth intervention can be developed to improve the management of COPD.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","output":"Features of a mobile health intervention to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colombia, like many developing nations, does not have a strong health system able to respond to a pandemic of the magnitude of Covid-19. There is an increasing need to create a model that allows particular clinics and hospitals to estimate the number of patients that require Intensive Care Units-ICU care (critical), and the number of patients that require hospital care (severe), but not ICU care, in order to manage their limited resources. This paper presents a prediction of the total number of ICU and regular beds that will be needed in Bogot, Colombia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use an SEIR model that includes three different categories of infection: those who can stay at home, those who need regular hospital beds, and those who need ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December.

COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to be prepared for the excess demand of services that a pandemic like this one generates. Unfortunately, the model predicts that by mid-November the projected capacity of the system in Bogot will not be enough.

Patients: Patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis or a positive test result for COVID-19. Interventions: Dialysis, tracheostomy, and ECMO. Measurements and Main Results: 240,392 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included (22,887 from HealthVerity, 139,971 from IQVIA Open Claims, 29,061 from Optum EHR, 4,336 from OPTUM SES, 36,019 from Premier, and 8,118 from VA-OMOP). Across the six databases, 9,703 (4.04% [95% CI: 3.96% to 4.11%]) patients received dialysis, 1,681 (0.70% [0.67% to 0.73%]) had a tracheostomy, and 398 (0.17% [95% CI: 0.15% to 0.18%]) patients underwent ECMO over the 30 days following hospitalization. Use of ECMO was generally concentrated among patients who were younger, male, and with fewer comorbidities except for obesity. Tracheostomy was used for a similar proportion of patients regardless of age, sex, or comorbidity. While dialysis was used for a similar proportion among younger and older patients, it was more frequent among male patients and among those with chronic kidney disease. Conclusion: Use of dialysis among those hospitalized with COVID-19 is high at around 4%. Although less than one percent of patients undergo tracheostomy and ECMO, the absolute numbers of patients who have undergone these interventions is substantial and can be expected to continue grow given the continuing spread of the COVID-19.","output":"Use of dialysis, tracheostomy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among 240,392 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Federated learning is a novel framework that enables resource-constrained edge devices to jointly learn a model, which solves the problem of data protection and data islands.

In this paper, we propose a Byzantine-robust framework for federated learning via credibility assessment on non-iid data (BRCA). Credibility assessment is designed to detect Byzantine attacks by combing adaptive anomaly detection model and data verification. Specially, an adaptive mechanism is incorporated into the anomaly detection model for the training and prediction of the model. Simultaneously, a unified update algorithm is given to guarantee that the global model has a consistent direction.

The correlation between the competition records and fitness factors was confirmed by correlation analysis. In addition, the physical factors affecting performance were identified through multiple regression analysis, and the average difference between national and international competitions was verified by t-test. The first result was that fencing, swimming, and horseback riding rankings were more relevant to the overall pentathlon performance score than the combined rankings in national competitions. In the international competitions, performance in the combined running and shooting event was more relevant than fencing, swimming, and horseback riding. Second, the basic fitness factors of grip strength and sergeant jump and the specific fitness factors of leg strengthleft and right average flexor were correlated with overall pentathlon performance national competitions. However, in international competitions, sergeant jump, 20 m shuttle run, reaction time, lung capacity, and back strength were correlated (presented in high to low order). In terms of the specific fitness factors, relative (%BW) and absolute (Nm) leg strengthleft and right average flexor, lower body anaerobic fatigue rate, half squat, relative (W/kg) and absolute (Watts) maximal lower body anaerobic power were correlated accordingly with overall pentathlon performance. Third, we analyzed the differences between average performance in national and international competitions. Only the combined running and shooting event out of the five modern pentathlon events showed a difference. Grip strength and relative leg strengthaverage extensor AP (%BW) appeared to be different among the physical fitness factors. Fourth, we examined the level of contribution of each of the fitness factors on overall performance.

The number of COVID-19 cases can be accurately predicted by considering historical data of reported cases alongside some external factors that affect the spread of the virus.

PARTICIPANTS: We recruited willing low-risk HCP, aged <50 years, with no comorbidities to work in COVID-19 zones. Social distancing, hand hygiene and universal masking were advocated in the low-risk zone. RESULTS: Between 31 March and 20 July 2020, we clinically screened 5553 outpatients, of whom 3012 (54.2%) were COVID-19 suspects managed in the medium-risk zone. Among them, 346 (11.4%) tested COVID-19 positive (57.2% male) and were managed in the high-risk zone with 19 (5.4%) deaths. One (0.08%) of the 1224 HCP in high-risk zone, 6 (0.62%) of 960 HCP in medium-risk zone and 23 (0.18%) of the 12 600 HCP in the low-risk zone tested positive at the end of shift. All the 30 COVID-19-positive HCP have since recovered. This HCP-centric policy resulted in low transmission rates (<1%), ensured satisfaction with training (92%), PPE (90.8%), medical and psychosocial support (79%) and improved acceptance of COVID-19 duty with 54.7% volunteering for re-deployment. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional HCP-centric policy was effective in ensuring safety, satisfaction and welfare of HCP in a resource-poor setting and resulted in a willing workforce to fight the pandemic.","output":"Multidimensional dynamic healthcare personnel (HCP)-centric model from a low-income and middle-income country to support and protect COVID-19 warriors: a large prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: o report outcomes of breakthrough COVID-19 in comparison with COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients with systemic rheumatic diseases (SRDs). METHODS: Patients with SRD with COVID-19 (vaccinated and unvaccinated) were included by their rheumatologists in a registry operated by the Greek Rheumatology Society in a voluntarily basis. Type, date and doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were recorded, and demographics, type of SRD, concurrent treatment, comorbidities and COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation, need for oxygen supplementation and death) were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. RESULTS: Between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2021, 195 patients with SRD with COVID-19 were included; 147 unvaccinated and 48 vaccinated with at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Pfizer n=38 or AstraZeneca n=10). Among vaccinated patients, 29 developed breakthrough COVID-19 >14 days after the second vaccine dose (fully vaccinated), while 19 between the first and <14 days after the second vaccine dose (partially vaccinated). Despite no differences in demographics, SRD type, treatment or comorbidities between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients, hospitalisation and mortality rates were higher in unvaccinated (29.3% and 4.1%, respectively) compared with partially vaccinated (21% and 0%) or fully vaccinated (10.3% and 0%) patients.

However, its impact on the maternal humoral response and placental IgG transport remains unclear. Objective To characterize the maternal humoral waning and neonate immunity acquired during the third COVID19 wave in Israel, dominated by the Alpha variant, as compared to earlier Wildtype infections and humoral response to vaccination across gestation. Design Maternal and fetal blood serum were collected at delivery since April 2020 from parturients. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using the Milliplex MAP SARS CoV2 Antigen Panel supplemented with additional HA coupled microspheres. Setting A nationwide multicenter cohort study on SARS CoV2 infections and vaccination during pregnancy. Participants Expectant women presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to 3 primary groups. 157 SARS CoV2 positive and 125 fully vaccinated during pregnancy, and 212 unvaccinated noninfected controls matched to the infected group by BMI, maternal age, comorbidities and gestational age. Eligibility criteria included pregnant women without active COVID19 disease, age over 18 years and willingness to provide informed consent. Main Outcomes and Measures Pregnant womens humoral response is dependent on the SARS CoV2 strain. Results The humoral response to infection as detected at birth, showed a gradual and significant decline as the interval between infection or vaccination and delivery increased. Significantly faster decay of antibody titers was found for infections occurring during the third wave compared to earlier infection or vaccination. Cord blood IgG antigens levels correlated with maternal IgG. However, cord IgG HA variance significantly differed in SARS CoV2 infections as compared to the other groups. No sexual dimorphism in IgG transfer was observed. Lastly, high fetal IgM response to SARS CoV2 was detected in 17 neonates, all showing elevated IgM to N suggesting exposure to SARS CoV2 antigens. Conclusions and Relevance Infections occurring during the third wave induced a faster decline in humoral response when compared to Wildtype infections or mRNA BNT162b2 vaccination during pregnancy, consistent with a shift in disease etiology and severity induced by the Alpha variant. Vaccination policies in previously infected pregnant women should consider the timing of exposure along pregnancy as well as the risk of infection to specific variants of concern.","output":"Waning of the Humoral Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Pregnancy is Variant-Dependent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Although disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease, Black adults remain underrepresented in clinical trials. The National Institutes of Health recommends that studies define goals for recruitment of underrepresented populations. However, the extent to which cardiovascular trials incorporate evidence-based recruitment strategies in their protocols is understudied. Methods and Results We systematically reviewed National Institutes of Health-funded cardiovascular clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov between 2000 and 2019. Based on publicly available or requested protocols, we focused on enrollment of Black adults as well as the following recruitment strategies: community-based, electronic medical record-based, and provider-based recruitment. A total of 100 clinical trials focused on cardiovascular disease were included in our analysis, of which 62% had published protocols, and 46% of trials had enrolled populations that were <25% Black. In our analysis of available trial protocols, 21% of trials defined a recruitment target for underrepresented groups; however, only one study reported achieving its enrollment goal. While 13% of trial protocols referenced community-based recruitment strategies, 5% explicitly mentioned involving community members in the trial design process. Defining recruitment targets was associated with higher enrollment of Black participants. Conclusions Black adults are underrepresented in National Institutes of Health-funded cardiovascular trials, and the majority of these trials did not specify a Black enrollment target, did not meet targets, and largely did not report specific plans to enroll Black adults in their studies.

The pandemic profoundly impacted mental health and the world's rates of suicide since its outbreak. COVID-19-related suicide rates nonetheless followed a non-linear trend over the pandemic, decreasing after the COVID-19 outbreak, then raising during an extended follow-up period. Thus, we aimed to further assess the suicide rates in Lombardy. We carried out a retrospective analysis of all the autopsies performed in the year 2020 and within the first four months of the year 2021 through the database of the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Milan. In the year 2020, the recorded suicides decreased in comparison to 2016-2019 (21.19-22.97% of the autopsies), being 98 (18.08% out of 542 autopsies), while, in the first 4 months of the year 2021, 35 suicides were documented (185 autopsies, overall). Since the region of Lombardy was severely affected by COVID-19 since the early months of the year 2020, the extended retrospective follow-up allowed for firmer conclusions and insights about the need to extend the follow-up of COVID-19 pandemic beyond the first months after the outbreak, worldwide.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected. 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes. A severe case was defined as including at least one of the following criteria: (1) Respiratory rate >30/min. (2) Oxygen saturation &#8804;93%. (3) PaO2/FiO2&#8804;300 mm Hg. (4) Patients, either with shock or respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, or combined with other organ failure, requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Of 193 patients with severe covid-19, 48 (24.9%) had diabetes. Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality. In addition, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C reaction protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor &#945;, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Among patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, more non-survivors were men (30 (76.9%) vs 9 (23.1%)). Non-survivors had severe inflammatory response, and cardiac, hepatic, renal and coagulation impairment. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a trend towards poorer survival in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes than patients without diabetes. The HR was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30; p=0.041) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease by Cox regression. The median survival durations from hospital admission in patients with severe covid-19 with and without diabetes were 10 days and 18 days, respectively.

We focused on two popular metropolitan newspapers: Beijing Morning Post and Beijing Evening News. Forty texts from each source were chosen (20 for ordinary weather and 20 for extreme weather). Results showed that the advice given stems from a vast reservoir of advice themes, and we found clear differences depending on weather, with significantly more advice given during extreme events. We also found that Beijing Evening News, in general, provided more advice in their weather commentaries. Finally, writers who were prone to take an authoritative stance tended to increase their use of imperatives and high-status vocatives during extreme weather, whereas those who positioned themselves with their readers also used more imperatives, but did not change their vocative preferences.","output":"Advice-giving in newspaper weather commentaries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of the pediatric patients infected with the new emerging 2019 coronavirus virus (SARS-CoV-2) in Hamadan and Sanandaj, west of Iran METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in Hamadan and Kurdistan province between March 1 to April 15, 2020 Medical records of the children diagnosed as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease were extracted and analyzed in this study We followed the WHO Guideline for the case definition of the patients RESULTS: Thirty patients admitted to the wards specified for COVID-19 diseases Nineteen (63%) patients categorized as confirmed by Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and 11 (37%) patients as probable according to Computed Tomography (CT) findings of the chest Sixteen (53 3%) cases were female, the youngest patient was one day old, and the oldest patient was 15 years old 11 (36 7%) cases had a definite history of close contact The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, and the most common sign was tachypnea None of our patients presented with a runny nose Lymphopenia and marked elevation of the C-reactive Protein observed in four (13 3%) and 12 (40%) cases, respectively There were 10 (33 3%) cases with normal chest X-rays Ground-Glass Opacities (GGOs) were the most common CT findings (19, 73 1%) All but one of the patients discharged without sequala An 11-yrs-old girl expired with a fulminant pneumonia CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is not uncommon in children and could have different presentations Concomitant use of RT-PCR and chest CT scans in symptomatic cases recommended as a modality of choice to diagnose the disease Routine laboratory tests, like many other viral infections, may not show significant or specific changes The superimposed bacterial infection seems not the determinant of clinical outcomes as most patients had a negative evaluation by specific laboratory tests for bacterial infections;got improved dramatically with a short or no antibiotic therapy","output":"Pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): An insight from west of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To design an effective and safe vaccine against betacoronaviruses, it is necessary to elicit a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses as well as to minimize the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection. This phenomenon was observed in animal trials of experimental vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV that were developed based on inactivated coronavirus or vector constructs expressing the spike protein (S) of the virion. The substitution and glycosylation of certain amino acids in the antigenic determinants of the S-protein, as well as its conformational changes, can lead to the same effect in a new experimental vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This review outlines approaches for developing vaccines against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that are based on non-pathogenic viral vectors. For efficient prevention of infections caused by respiratory pathogens the ability of the vaccine to stimulate mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract is important. Such a vaccine can be developed using non-pathogenic Sendai virus vector, since it can be administered intranasally and induce a mucosal immune response that strengthens the antiviral barrier in the respiratory tract and provides reliable protection against infection. The mucosal immunity and the production of IgA antibodies accompanying its development reduces the likelihood of developing an antibody-dependent infection enhancement, which is usually associated only with immunopathological IgG antibodies.","output":"[The Challenges of Vaccine Development Against Betacoronaviruses: Antibody Dependent Enhancement and Sendai Virus as a Possible Vaccine Vector]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score &#8805;5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia.

This is particularly important for groups with higher rates of high-risk health conditions, including those aged 65 and over and people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We examined trust in information sources and associated adherence to COVID-19 public health recommendations among people with disabilities living in metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore counties. METHODS: We recruited participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and screened for disability status (n = 408). We compared sociodemographic groups with t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and Chi-square, as appropriate. We used linear regression to examine factors associated with trust in information and compliance with CDC recommended COVID-19 practices. RESULTS: Nonmetro respondents had the lowest trust ratings among all demographic groups, and reported significantly less trust in most information sources. Respondents aged 65 and over reported the highest compliance with CDC recommended practices, while those from nonmetro areas reported the lowest. A regression model for adherence to CDC recommended practices was significant (F = 11.87, P &#8804; .001), and explained 33% of the variance. Specifically, increased adherence was associated with being over 65, female, and higher general trust scores. Decreased practices were associated with being nonwhite, nonmetro, higher trust scores in President Trump, and having a communication disability. CONCLUSIONS: Trust in information sources is associated with action. It is important to provide clear, consistent, and non-polarizing messages during public health emergencies to promote widespread community action.","output":"A cross-sectional analysis of trust of information and COVID-19 preventative practices among people with disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Primarily an infection of the lower respiratory tract, it is now well known to cause multisystem abnormalities. Hematologic manifestations constitute a significant area of concern. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects monocytes and endothelial cells leading to a complex downstream cascade, cytokine storm, and eventual intravascular thrombosis. Coronavirus disease 2019 causes lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia. Prophylactic anticoagulation is vital in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as its effect on the coagulation system is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease can cause both arterial and venous thromboses, especially pulmonary embolism and pulmonary microthrombi. A high index of suspicion is indispensable in recognizing these complications, and timely institution of therapeutic anticoagulation is vital in treating them. Virus-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon but shares some similarities to sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.

This paper explores the different factors that influenced public perceptions in France of the efficacy of HCQ as well as their evolution between April 2020 and June 2021. METHODS: This article draws on 5 surveys conducted among representative samples of the French population (projects COCONEL and TRACTRUST; quota method, n = 1006; 1004; 2006; 1014 and 1005). We asked questions on the effectiveness of chloroquine against COVID-19. We also collected sociodemographic variables and attitudes toward politics and science. RESULTS: Between April and June 2021, the proportion of respondents who believed in the efficacy of HCQ decreased rapidly from 35% to 14%. The proportion of respondents who believed that HCQ is ineffective rose gradually from 6% to 21%. After adjusting for the temporal effect, the logistic regression showed a very strong association between political orientation and the belief in the efficacy of HCQ. Respondents who felt closest to the more radical parties (far-right and far-left) were more likely to believe in the efficacy of HCQ than those who felt closest to the political center (O.R. 2.48 [1.95C3.15] and 1.87 [1.44C2.43]). The role of trust in the government and in science and of the degree of political engagement were investigated in the two waves conducted after the scientific consensus was established during the summer of 2020. High levels of trust in the government and in science and of politicization are associated with belief of HCQ proven inefficacy. Across the whole period, a majority of respondents were uncertain. Even in 2021, 41.5% stated that the data were insufficient to decide whether or not HCQ is effective and 25.2% stating that they did not know. CONCLUSION: Because media coverage of scientific controversies is higher in times of uncertainty than after these controversies have died down, the publicization of therapeutic promises can have lasting consequences on attitudes towards science and medicine.","output":"Does the public know when a scientific controversy is over?

In male lowlanders, does hypoxia modulate thermoregulatory effector responses during repeated whole-body cold stress encountered in a single day? What is the main finding and its importance? A a10 h sustained exposure to hypoxia appears to mediate a gradual upregulation of endogenous heat production, preventing the progressive hypothermic response prompted by serial cold stimuli. Also, hypoxia progressively degrades mood, and compounds the perceived thermal discomfort, and sensations of fatigue and coldness. ABSTRACT: We examined whether hypoxia would modulate thermoeffector responses during repeated cold stress encountered in a single day. Eleven men completed two a10 h sessions, while breathing, in normobaria, either normoxia or hypoxia ( P O 2 : 12 kPa). During each session, subjects underwent sequentially three 120 min immersions to the chest in 20C water (CWI), interspersed by 120 min rewarming. In normoxia, the final drop in rectal temperature (Trec ) was greater in the third (a1.2C) than in the first and second (a0.9C) CWIs (P < 0.05). The first hypoxic CWI augmented the Trec fall (a1.2C; P = 0.002), but the drop in Trec did not vary between the three hypoxic CWIs (P = 0.99). In normoxia, the metabolic heat production ( M ? ) was greater during the first half of the third CWI than during the corresponding part of the first CWI (P = 0.02); yet the difference was blunted during the second half of the CWIs (P = 0.89). In hypoxia, by contrast, the increase in M ? was augmented by a25% throughout the third CWI (P < 0.01). Regardless of the breathing condition, the cold-induced elevation in mean arterial pressure was blunted in the second and third CWI (P < 0.05). Hypoxia aggravated the sensation of coldness (P = 0.05) and thermal discomfort (P = 0.04) during the second half of the third CWI. The present findings therefore demonstrate that prolonged hypoxia mediates, in a gradual manner, metabolic and thermoperceptual sensitization to repeated cold stress.","output":"Hypoxia gradually augments metabolic and thermoperceptual responsiveness to repeated whole-body cold stress in humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has become a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide.

In providing this example, our aim is two-fold: to highlight the value of using qualitative research and co-design processes within intervention development; and to showcase systematic reporting of an interventions early planning and design stages. METHODS: A person-based and co-design approach informed the planning and design of the self-compassion intervention. In Stage 1, qualitative interviews were undertaken with 14 family carers of people living with dementia and 14 professional stakeholders. In Stage 2, intervention guiding principles were developed, psychological theory was incorporated, and six family carers of people living with dementia were engaged as co-designers. RESULTS: Knowledge generated during intervention planning identified that the intervention should be situated within the concept of compassion more broadly; address misperceptions, fears, blocks, and resistances to self-compassion; and target feelings of shame, guilt, and self-criticism. Subsequent intervention design activities determined that the needs of family carers of people living with dementia were best met by tailoring an existing intervention, namely group-based Compassion-Focused Therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic approach highlights the value of incorporating in-depth qualitative research and co-design within the intervention development process to prioritise the perspectives and lived experiences of family carers of people living with dementia.

The urban morphological characteristics explained up to 73% of the variance in normalized PM(2.5) concentrations in street canyons, indicating that the spatial variation of the near-surface PM(2.5) air quality was mostly defined by the characteristics studied. The fraction of urban trees nearby the stations was found to be the most important urban morphological characteristic in explaining the PM(2.5) air quality, followed by the height-normalized roughness length as the second important parameter.

This paper reviews recent developments addressing some of the limitations including coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact of control measures on disease progression, linking with zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real environments and recent work on dose-response modelling to simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A stochastic version of the Wells-Riley model is presented that allows consideration of the effects of small populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic effects present in a real situation could underestimate the risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of new infections between connected spaces is strongly dependent on the airflow.

According to the patients' and their families' willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment, while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment. Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28-day mortality rate, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: This study involved 101 severe/critical patients with COVID-19, among which 50 were in the treatment group and 51 were in the control group. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre-treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices et al. showed no difference between the two groups.

METHODS: Pregnancy-related VTE hospitalizations were identified through a code-targeted search of the Hadassah Medical Center's computerized database. A manual analysis of relevant medical records was performed, and cases diagnosed throughout the year 2020 were compared to those diagnosed during 2019 and 2018. Statistical analyses studied obstetrical outcomes, as well as the extent and treatment of VTE events during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those of preceding years, stratified by pre-, intra-, and post-lockdown periods. RESULTS: The incidence of pregnancy-related thromboembolic events during 2020 was 0.16% of all deliveries, significantly higher than in 2018 and 2019 (0.06% and 0.1%, respectively; P < 0.05). Higher rates of VTE events were found during post-lockdown periods in 2020, compared with corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2018. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that lockdown periods impact pregnancy-related VTE hospitalizations, possibly as a result of restricted population mobility.

Reports regarding those in training were scarce and scattered in the early pandemic, what made an overarching insight a challenge. This review compiles and analyzes the literature addressing the preparation of students and residents in the first four months of the Covid-19 pandemic to find gaps and implications for the current pandemic as well as for future scenarios. Methods: : We performed a systematic literature search and content analysis (CA) for articles available in English language that focus on the preparation of students and residents in human medicine within the first four months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: : We retrieved 82 articles from a wide range of journals, professional backgrounds and countries. CA identified five recurring subgroup topics of ?faculty preparation?, ?uncertainty and mental health?, ?clinical knowledge?, ?rights and obligations? and ?(self-) support and supply?. Within these subgroups the main concerns of ?(re)deployment?, ?interruption of training and career?, ?safety issues?, ?transmission of disease?, and ?restricted social interaction? were identified as potential stressors that hold a risk for fatigue, loss of morale and burnout. Discussion: Students and residents are willing and able to participate, when provided with appropriate deployment, thorough supervision, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and valid knowledge. Faculties and policymakers should be in close contact with the youngest in training to value their concerns and intrinsic creativity on the scenario. The use of new technology for interaction and knowledge provision, interviews for voluntary deployment and the provision of mental health support seem appropriate measures to support students and residents under the current pandemic. Conclusion: Our review holds thorough implications for faculties and policymakers. Not only for surge capacity, but also for the safety and the professional identity formation of those in training, it is crucial to understand their needs and concerns. Leaders should strive for a close communication with students and residents, value their intrinsic creativeness and constantly evaluate on their needs regarding knowledge aspects, safety measures, legal concerns and well-being for the construction of nation-wide homogenous policies.","output":"Preparation of students and residents of human medicine in the first four months of the Covid-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The demand for front-line nurses continues to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their willingness varies significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to explore nurses' willingness to report for front-line work. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 1,310 nurses from six tertiary hospitals was conducted. The participants completed self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 90.5% of nurses reported that they would like to voluntarily participate in front-line work. Those with previous training, higher self-efficacy scores, and lower perceived risk and self-worth scores were more likely to participate in front-line work, while nurses, who had 11-15 years of work experience and were worried about their family and the lack of family support, were less likely to be involved in front-line work. CONCLUSION: This study found that the vast majority of nurses were willing to participate in front-line work and affirmed the positive effects of previous infection prevention training, self-efficacy and self-worth.

In addition to these viruses, a new infectious agent named Apple hammerhead viroid (AHVd) has been identified. We investigated whether thermotherapy or cryotherapy alone or a combination of both could effectively eradicate ACLSV, ASGV, and AHVd from in vitro cultures of four apple rootstocks developed in the Cornell-Geneva apple rootstock breeding program (CG 2034, CG 4213, CG 5257, and CG 6006). For thermotherapy treatments, in vitro plants were treated for four weeks at 36 C (day) and 32 C (night). Plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) and cryotherapy treatments included a shoot tip preculture in 2 M glycerol + 0.8 M sucrose for one day followed by exposure to PVS2 for 60 or 75 min at 22 C, either without or with liquid nitrogen (LN, cryotherapy) exposure. Combinations of thermotherapy and PVS2/cryotherapy treatments were also performed. Following treatments, shoot tips were warmed, recovered on growth medium, transferred to the greenhouse, grown, placed in dormancy inducing conditions, and then grown again prior to sampling leaves for the presence of viruses and viroids. Overall, thermotherapy combined with cryotherapy treatment resulted in the highest percentage of virus- and viroid-free plants, suggesting great potential for producing virus- and viroid-free planting materials for the apple industry.

Despite the reduction of primary emissions during the lockdown period, heavy haze pollution was observed unexpectedly in megacities in North and East China. In this study, we conducted online measurements of organic aerosol in a background site before and during the lockdown in Guanzhong basin, Northwest China. The oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) increased from 24% of total OA (3.2  1.6 g m-3) before lockdown to 54% of total OA (4.5  1.3 g m-3) during lockdown, likely due to substantial decrease of NOx emissions during lockdown which resulted in large increase of O3 and thus atmospheric oxidizing capacity. OOA showed higher mass concentrations and fractional contributions during lockdown than before lockdown, and increased with the increase of Ox in both periods. In comparison, aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) showed high mass concentrations and fractional contributions in both polluted periods before and during lockdown with the increase of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). The increase of aqSOA under high ALWC conditions is very likely the reason of pollution events during lockdown. Combined with trajectory analysis, the absence of Guanzhong cluster in polluted period during lockdown may play a key role in the OA variations between two polluted periods. In addition, when comparing the clusters from the same transmission directions between before lockdown and during lockdown, the OA fractions showed similar variations during lockdown in all clusters, suggesting the OA variations are widespread in northwest China.","output":"Enhanced formation of secondary organic aerosol from photochemical oxidation during the COVID-19 lockdown in a background site in Northwest China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are one of the most effective public health measures that are designed to prevent serious illness caused by a wide variety of infectious agents, which have become especially important in light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated age-dependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percents of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS: Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts.

METHODS: We conducted an interim analysis of the international, multicentre HOPE COVID-19 registry including patients admitted for a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection until 18 April 2020. Those treated with NIV were considered. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or need for intubation. The components of the composite endpoint were the secondary outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted predictors of the primary endpoint within those initially treated with NIV were investigated. RESULTS: 1933 patients who were included in the registry during the study period had data on oxygen support type. Among them, 390 patients (20%) were treated with NIV. Compared with those receiving other non-invasive oxygen strategy, patients receiving NIV showed significantly worse clinical and laboratory signs of ARF at presentation. Of the 390 patients treated with NIV, 173 patients (44.4%) met the composite endpoint. In-hospital death was the main determinant (147, 37.7%), while 62 patients (15.9%) needed invasive ventilation. Those requiring invasive ventilation had the lowest survival rate (41.9%). After adjustment, age (adjusted OR (adj(OR)) for 5-year increase: 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63, p<0.001), hypertension (adj(OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.61, p=0.03), room air O(2) saturation <92% at presentation (adj(OR) 3.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.28, p=0.01), lymphocytopenia (adj(OR) 3.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.85, p=0.03) and in-hospital use of antibiotic therapy (adj(OR) 4.91, 95% CI 1.69 to 14.26, p=0.003) were independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: NIV was used in a significant proportion of patients within our cohort, and more than half of these patients survived without the need for intubation. NIV may represent a viable strategy particularly in case of overcrowded and limited intensive care resources, but prompt identification of failure is mandatory to avoid harm. Further studies are required to better clarify our hypothesis.

A novel and promising therapeutic approach to KOA is the so-called regenerative medicine, a set of procedures designed to harness tissue regenerative capacity and optimize functional recovery. Increasing evidence points out that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) intra-articular injections can decrease pain and improve functional abilities in KOA patients. In the present case reports, we analyze two patients who were treated with PRP injections coupled with a posttreatment home-based rehabilitation program. The two patients were selected to represent two different populations: patient 1 was an 85-year-old with severe impairment of functional abilities, while patient 2 was a younger (59 years old) and more active patient. The protocol consisted in a series of exercise to be performed at home, during the five days following PRP injection for two consecutive weeks (10 days in total). The exercises were designed to reduce the inflammation after the injection, enhance the proprioceptive control of the treated lower limb, and strengthen hip and knee flexors and extensors, mainly by isometric work. Results were evaluated at two time points: before and 2 months after the first PRP injection. The outcomes considered were as follows: visual analog scale for pain, EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire, Tegner Activity Scale for functioning, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Both patients did not report any side effects from the treatment. Improvement in patient 1 was drastic at the two months follow-up as far as pain and functional abilities are concerned. Patient 2s improvement was less evident, probably due to the higher starting point in both pain and functionality. Overall, the developed program seemed safe and was tolerated by the patients analyzed in the study, who performed it with good compliance.","output":"Case Report: Rehabilitation After Platelet-Rich Growth Factors Intra-Articular Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis: Two Case Reports of a Home-Based Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID crisis has abruptly broken into our hospitals, and many difficulties have emerged, including those related to supply logistics. A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Espa?ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrile?o de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","output":"El servicio de farmacia frente a la logstica de adquisicin de medicamentos./ Hospital Pharmacy Service: Facing the logistics of medicines procurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Furloughing is presenting new challenges for wellbeing within the veterinary team.

As an inhaled therapy, iNO reaches well ventilated portions of the lung and selectively vasodilates the pulmonary vascular bed, with little systemic effect due to its rapid inactivation in the bloodstream. iNO is well documented to improve oxygenation in a variety of pathological conditions, but in ARDS, these transient improvements in oxygenation have not translated into meaningful clinical outcomes. In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related ARDS, iNO has been proposed as a potential treatment due to a variety of mechanisms, including its vasodilatory effect, antiviral properties, as well as anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions. Presently however, no randomized controlled data are available evaluating iNO in COVID-19, and published data are largely derived from retrospective and cohort studies. It is therefore important to interpret these limited findings with caution, as many questions remain around factors such as patient selection, optimal dosing, timing of administration, duration of administration, and delivery method. Each of these factors may influence whether iNO is indeed an efficacious therapy - or not - in this context. As such, until randomized controlled trial data are available, use of iNO in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 related ARDS should be considered on an individual basis with sound clinical judgement from the attending physician.","output":"More questions than answers for the use of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rabies is a highly fatal disease that is endemic in Nigeria.

Newly diagnosed PLHIV may require more intensive care early in their treatment course, yet frequent appointments can be burdensome to patients and health systems. Determining the optimal parameters for defining clinical stability and transitioning to less frequent appointments could decrease patient burden and health system costs. The objectives of this pilot study are to explore the feasibility and acceptability of (1) reducing the time to DSD from 12 to 6 months after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and (2) reducing the number of suppressed viral loads required to enter DSD from two to one. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The present study is a pilot, unblinded trial taking place in three health facilities in Kigali, Rwanda. Current Rwandan guidelines require PLHIV to be on ART for 12 months with two consecutive suppressed viral loads in order to transition to less frequent appointments. We will randomise 90 participants to one of three arms: entry into DSD at 6 months after one suppressed viral load (n=30), entry into DSD at 6 months after two suppressed viral loads (n=30) or current standard of care (n=30). We will measure feasibility and acceptability of this intervention; clinical outcomes include viral suppression at 12 months (primary outcome) and appointment attendance (secondary outcome).

This approach is advantageous over de novo drug discovery in accelerating clinical development, in terms of lower costs, a shortened development period, a well-known action mechanism, a feasible dosage, and an acceptable safety profile. AREAS COVERED This work was aimed at reviewing agents with successful DR in hematology. EXPERT OPINION Thalidomide and plerixafor have been successfully repositioned for treating multiple myeloma and harvesting peripheral blood stem cells, respectively. The former was originally developed as a sedative and the latter as an anti-HIV drug. Currently, the feasibility of repositioning various agents is being explored (e.g., an anti-influenza virus drug oseltamivir for primary immune thrombocytopenia, an anti-HIV drug abacavir for adult T-cell leukemia, and a macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for multiple myeloma). Furthermore, bosutinib for chronic myeloid leukemia or the antiplatelet drug cilostazol have been suggested to have clinical benefits for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ischemic stroke, respectively. To promote DR, effective application of artificial intelligence or stem cell models, comprehensive database construction shared between academia and pharmaceutical companies, suitable handling of drug patents, and wide cooperation in the area of specialty are warranted.","output":"Current status of drug repositioning in hematology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A global pandemic has resulted from the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Direct viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in hepatocytes may be one of the mechanisms of liver injury. We aimed to determine the role of viral persistence of SARS-CoV-2, based on cycle threshold (Ct) value, in liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: This was a territory-wide retrospective cohort study of all public hospitals in Hong Kong. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Serial liver biochemistries and Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 7,622 COVID-19 patients (mean age 47 years, 48.2% male) diagnosed from 24 March to 1 January 2021 who had serial liver biochemistries and Ct values. 1,363 (17.9%) COVID-19 patients had ALT/AST elevations with two temporal patterns C early (within first 14 days from symptom onset) and late (after 14 days from symptom onset). COVID-19 patients with ALT/AST elevations had a lower Ct value at admission (23 vs. 25; P<0.001), day 5 (24 vs. 26; P<0.001) and day 20 (31 vs. 32; P<0.001) after admission, compared to those without ALT/AST elevations. COVID-19 patients with ALT/AST elevations had a longer duration from first positive to first negative RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 (13 vs. 9 days; P<0.001). ALT/AST elevation and presence of diabetes were the independent risk factors of viral persistence.

SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing right frontal lobe lesion with significant vasogenic edema. Two brain biopsies of the lesion showed perivascular and intraluminal lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate consistent with vasculitis. Despite extensive treatment with immunomodulatory therapies targeting primary angiitis of the central nervous system, she experienced neurologic decline and died 93 days after presentation.

The subsequent lockdown altered lifestyles and worsened mental illnesses. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal disorder that is affected by environmental factors. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19 and the state of emergency on the lifestyle and disease activity of patients with IBD. Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey on patients with IBD from June 16 to August 21, 2020 during their regular follow-up at our hospital, 2 months after the state of emergency was declared. Results: Overall, 241 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 210 with Crohn's disease (CD) completed the survey, of which 82 (34%) and 97 (46%) patients, respectively, reported disease exacerbation within 2 months after the lockdown. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age at enrollment (odds ratio, OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96C0.99; P < 0.05), sleep hours (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57C0.97; P < 0.05), and increased stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic (OR, 6.06; 95% CI, 1.79C20.50; P < 0.01) as independent factors associated with UC exacerbation. Patients with exacerbated CD were younger at CD onset and had higher patient-reported outcome 2 scores before the state of emergency than patients with non-exacerbated CD.

Few successful vaccine candidates have been approved against SARS-CoV-2; however, their therapeutic efficacy against the mutated strains of the virus remains questionable. Furthermore, the limited supply of vaccines and promising antiviral drugs have created havoc in the present scenario. Plant-based phytochemicals (bioactive molecules) are promising because of their low side effects and high therapeutic value. In this study, we aimed to screen for suitable phytochemicals with higher therapeutic value using the two most crucial proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and main protease (Mpro). We used computational tools such as molecular docking and steered molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the different types of interactions and estimated the relative binding forces between the phytochemicals and their respective targets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that not only involves a search for a therapeutic bioactive molecule but also sheds light on the mechanisms underlying target inhibition in terms of calculations of force and work needed to extractthe ligand from the pocket of its target. The complexes showing higher binding forces were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamic simulations to check the stability of the ligand inside the binding pocket.

Children with IBDs have a dysfunctional immune system and they are frequently treated with immunomodulating drugs and biological therapy, which significantly impair immune system functions and lead to an increased risk of infections. Vaccines are essential to prevent at least part of these infections and this explains why strict compliance to the immunization guidelines specifically prepared for IBD patients is strongly recommended. However, several factors might lead to insufficient immunization. In this paper, present knowledge on the use of vaccines in children with IBDs is discussed. Literature review showed that despite a lack of detailed quantification of the risk of infections in children with IBDs, these children might have infections more frequently than age-matched healthy subjects, and at least in some cases, these infections might be even more severe. Fortunately, most of these infections could be prevented when recommended schedules of immunization are carefully followed. Vaccines given to children with IBDs generally have adequate immunogenicity and safety. Attention must be paid to live attenuated vaccines that can be administered only to children without or with mild immune system function impairment.

From a birds eye view, the COVID-19 pandemic management relies on revolutionizing the disease surveillance by incorporating artificial intelligence and data analytics, boosting the response strategiesextensive testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and social distancingand promoting awareness and access to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are discussed in the present chapter. We also preview the economic bearing of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Preparing for the Perpetual Challenges of Pandemics of Coronavirus Infections with Special Focus on SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With continued expansion of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), both antiviral drugs as well as effective vaccines are desperately needed to treat patients at high risk of life-threatening disease. Here, we present in vitro evidence for significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by oleandrin and a defined extract of N. oleander (designated as PBI-06150). Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic (pre-infection) oleandrin (as either the pure compound or as the active principal ingredient in PBI-06150) administration at concentrations as low as 0.05 g/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g/ml concentration resulted in a greater than 3000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values were 11.98 ng/ml when virus output was measured at 24 h post-infection, and 7.07 ng/ml measured at 48 h post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 h after SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with 0.1 g/ml and 0.05 g/ml concentrations causing greater than 100-fold reduction as measured at 48 h, and the 0.05 g/ml concentration resulting in a 78-fold reduction. Concentrations of oleandrin up to 10 g/ml were well tolerated in Vero cells. We also present in vivo evidence of the safety and efficacy of defined N. oleander extract (PBI-06150), which was administered to golden Syrian hamsters in a preparation containing as high as 130 g/ml of oleandrin. In comparison to administration of control vehicle, PBI-06150 provided a statistically significant reduction of the viral titer in the nasal turbinates (nasal conchae). The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here, together with initial evidence of its safety and efficacy in a relevant hamster model of COVID-19, support the further development of oleandrin and/or defined extracts containing this molecule for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and associated COVID-19 disease and potentially also for reduction of virus spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.","output":"Antiviral activity of oleandrin and a defined extract of Nerium oleander against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The production of zinc-containing nanostructures has a large variety of applications.

DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care. PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 require early IMV, a high frequency of ventilation in prone decubitus, and have a high incidence of failed HFO. The lack of improvement of PaO2/FiO2 at 7 days could be a prognostic marker. .","output":"Infeccin grave por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: experiencia en un hospital de tercer nivel con pacientes afectados por COVID-19 durante la pandemia 2020./ Infeccin grave por coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: experiencia en un hospital de tercer nivel con pacientes afectados por COVID-19 durante la pandemia 2020./ Severe infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus: Experience of a tertiary hospital with COVID-19 patients during the 2020 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The central government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Hanoi's municipal authorities are enthusiastically embracing a series of plans and policies for the capital city to create a sustainable mega-city. This state imaginary privileges 'modern' mobilities, championing highways, a bus rapid transport system, and an elevated metro, while so called 'traditional' means of moving around the city such as motorbikes, bicycles, or cyclos are being strongly discouraged and increasingly marginalised. For example, Hanoi officials are implementing a step-wise ban on motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030, while the majority of the urban population travels by motorbike, with about five million motorbikes plying the city's streets. While such an approach not only creates mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents of the city as a whole, it threatens to undermine the livelihoods of thousands of informal motorbike taxi drivers (locally known as xe ?m). In this article I engage with the emerging mobility injustice literature to explore how state discourses regarding urban modernisation are impacting the possibilities for Hanoi's xe ?m drivers to maintain access to city streets and viable livelihoods. These drivers must negotiate emerging and often conflicting state policies, their enforcement, as well as new app-based competitors, all of which challenge the equitable distribution of motility and produce important frictions. Nonetheless, xe ?m drivers draw on their agency and creativity during their daily routines to push back, while also creating new narratives regarding their vital role in maintaining neighbourhood security. We thus see how marginalised individuals are counteracting policies they consider unjust, even when this urban agenda is embedded in a politically socialist context.","output":"Informal motorbike taxi drivers and mobility injustice on Hanoi's streets.

Next, we analysed whether changes in these metabolic risk factors were mediated by psychological and behavioural mechanisms. DesignIn this natural experiment, we assessed changes from baseline in metabolic CVD risk factors in the exposed group (whose follow-up measurements were taken during the pandemic), and compared these to the changes in the control group (whose follow-up measurements were taken before the pandemic). ParticipantsThis study used data from 6962 participants from six different ethnic groups (Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish and Moroccan) of the HELIUS study, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We included women and men without prior CVD, who participated in both the baseline (2011-2015) and follow-up measurements (2019-2021). Outcome measuresChanges between baseline and follow-up measurements in six metabolic CVD risk factors were calculated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), total cholesterol (TC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). ResultsThe exposed group experienced somewhat less favourable changes over time in SBP, DBP and FPG (the latter only in women) than the control group, while temporal changes in HbA1c and eGFR were more favourable among the control group. For instance, SBP was 1.119 mmHg [0.046, 2.193] higher in exposed than non-exposed women, and 1.380 [0.288, 2.471] in men. Changes in SBP and DBP were partially mediated by changes in behavioural factors, most notably BMI and alcohol consumption. ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the restrictive lockdown measures, is associated with a deterioration of several CVD risk factors in women and men.

Randomised data in mild-moderate disease are lacking. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospitalisation in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. Methods This open-label, randomised superiority clinical trial at 19 centres in the United Kingdom enrolled adults, []18 years, presenting to hospitals with clinically-diagnosed highly-probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with <14 days symptoms, considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomised (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg daily orally for 14 days) or to standard care without macrolides. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of participants with death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation, assessed according to intention-to-treat (ITT). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381962, Study closed. Findings 298 participants were enrolled from 3rd June 2020 to 29th January 2021. The primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants. The primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (Adjusted OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.43-1.92], p=0.80). Rates of respiratory failure, progression to pneumonia, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, including serious cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between groups. Interpretation In patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalisation or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19.

Using random variation in air pollution generated by thermal inversions, we rule out that changes in mobility and economic activity are driving the results. We find that a 1%-increase in air pollution levels over the three preceding weeks leads to a 1.5% increase in weekly cases. A 1%-increase in air pollution over four weeks leads to 5.1% more COVID-19 deaths.

Overall 11 out of 45 (24 %) CADs inhibited MARVpp by 40 % or more. The strongest antiviral compounds were dronedarone, triparanol and quinacrine. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed highly significant correlations between antiviral activity, hydrophobicity (ClogP>4), and DIPL. Moreover, pKa and intra-molecular distance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties correlated with antiviral activity, but to a lesser extent.

Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale whereas publication bias was assessed with the Beggs and Eggers tests. Certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Nineteen studies in 3,764 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Both C3 and C4 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status than patients with low severity or survivor status (C3 SMD=-0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.21, p<0.001; C4 SMD=-0.29, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.09, p=0.005; moderate certainty of evidence). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (C3, I(2) = 82.1%; C4, I(2) = 84.4%). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not modified. There was no publication bias. In meta-regression, the SMD of C3 was significantly associated with white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and pro-thrombin time, whereas the SMD of C4 was significantly associated with CRP, pro-thrombin time, D-dimer, and albumin. In conclusion, lower concentrations of C3 and C4, indicating complement activation, were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 severity and mortality. C3 and C4 might be useful to predict adverse clinical consequences in these patients.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) share similar negative features to asbestos, provoking concerns about their contribution to MPM. This study was used to identify genes associated with CNT-induced MPM. METHODS: Microarray datasets were available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The limma method was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CNT-exposed MeT5A cells (GSE48855) or mice (GSE51636). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network construction were conducted to screen hub DEGs. The mRNA expression levels of hub DEGs were validated on MPM samples of GSE51024, GSE2549 and GSE42977 datasets, and their diagnostic efficacy was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic values of hub DEGs were assessed using online tools based on The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Their functions were annotated by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) enrichment and correlation with immune cells and markers. RESULTS: WGCNA identified that two modules were associated with disease status. Thirty-one common DEGs in the GSE48855 and GSE51636 datasets were overlapped with the genes in these two modules. Twenty of them had a high degree centrality (4) in the PPI network. Four DEGs (FN1, fibronectin 1; UGCG, UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase; CHPF2, chondroitin polymerizing factor 2; and THBS2, thrombospondin 2) could predict the overall survival, and they were confirmed to be upregulated in MPM samples compared with controls. Also, they could effectively predict the MPM risk, with an overall accuracy of >0.9. DAVID analysis revealed FN1, CHPF2 and THBS2 functioned in cell-ECM interactions; UGCG influenced glycosphingolipid metabolism. All genes were positively associated with infiltrating levels of immune cells (macrophages or dendritic cells) and the expression of the dendritic cell marker (NRP1, neuropilin 1). CONCLUSION: These four immune-related genes represent potential biomarkers for monitoring CNT-induced MPM and predicting the prognosis.","output":"Four Immune-Related Genes (FN1, UGCG, CHPF2 and THBS2) as Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for Carbon Nanotube-Induced Mesothelioma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To provide a descriptive account of the challenges and administrative preparedness for establishing and sustaining safe obstetric services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic at Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India.

Thus, they remain overlooked or excluded during integration processes of health care systems. At the same time, there are calls by the profession at national and international levels for community pharmacy to be integrated within primary care systems. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have further stimulated this desire. When pressing for integration, various terms, such as integration, integrated care, or interprofessional collaboration, are used in an interchangeable manner leading to lack of clarity, ambiguity and confusion for health care policy makers, planners, and other healthcare professionals. The literature was reviewed to identify critical components for community pharmacy to consider for integration. From the five selected articles describing integration of community pharmacies, four different constructs were identified: consensus, connectivity, communication and trust. The integration of community pharmacy into the health system may translate into better access for patients to primary care services, contribute to cost effectiveness, and promulgate the sustainability of the system. However significant political, economic, social, and practice change would be required by all stakeholders. Further research is needed to underpin a consensus for a definition, the type of integration, and the model optimally suited to integrate community pharmacy into primary care. These models, specific and adaptable to each national health care system and political environment, would need to be consensus-based by principal stakeholders to overcome a variety of barriers, including government resistance.

METHODS: Sixteen male pigs were studied in two groups. The Group Surgery was composed of 8 animals submitted to a Roux en Y gastric bypass. The Group Control comprised 8 pigs receiving identical care, except for the surgical procedure. Group Surgery was followed for 90 days, when the bypassed gastric segment was resected. Group Control was followed for 84 days, when the stomach was resected. RESULTS: Weight loss and the amount of food intake were evaluated in both groups. Macroscopic findings, histopathologic changes of the gastric wall, gastric gland morphometry and the amount of collagen type I and III of the gastric mucosa in the bypassed gastric segment were evaluated. Group Control exhibited a significant larger weight gain and food intake compared to surgery. The gastric glands were smaller and type I collagen was predominant in Surgery compared to Control. No changes were noted in the type III collagen. Fat tissue was identified among the muscle fibers in the isolated segment of Group Surgery. CONCLUSION: This model of Roux en Y gastric bypass in pigs offers consistent weight and food intake reduction. Secondly, Roux en Y gastric bypass in pigs does not induce macroscopic changes in mucosa.

The aim of this trial was to investigate if a protocol for awake prone positioning reduces the rate of endotracheal intubation compared with standard care among patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for respiratory support and a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio  20 kPa were randomly assigned to a protocol targeting 16 h prone positioning per day or standard care. The primary endpoint was intubation within 30 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of awake prone positioning, 30-day mortality, ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, use of noninvasive ventilation, organ support and adverse events. The trial was terminated early due to futility. RESULTS: Of 141 patients assessed for eligibility, 75 were randomized of whom 39 were allocated to the control group and 36 to the prone group. Within 30 days after enrollment, 13 patients (33%) were intubated in the control group versus 12 patients (33%) in the prone group (HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.46C2.21), P = 0.99). Median prone duration was 3.4 h [IQR 1.8C8.4] in the control group compared with 9.0 h per day [IQR 4.4C10.6] in the prone group (P = 0.014). Nine patients (23%) in the control group had pressure sores compared with two patients (6%) in the prone group (difference ? 18% (95% CI ? 2 to ? 33%); P = 0.032).

Benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX) are the only approved drugs for CD chemotherapy. Although both drugs are highly effective in acute and paediatric infections, their efficacy in adults with chronic CD (CCD) is lower and variable. Moreover, the high incidence of adverse events (AEs) with both drugs has hampered their widespread use. Trials in CCD adults showed that quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays remain negative for 12 months after standard-of-care (SoC) BZN treatment in ~80% patients. BZN pharmacokinetic data and the nonsynchronous nature of the proliferative mammal-dwelling parasite stage suggested that a lower BZN/NFX dosing frequency, combined with standard or extended treatment duration, might have the same or better efficacy than either drug SoC, with fewer AEs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: New ThErapies and Biomarkers for ChagaS infEctiOn (TESEO) is an open-label, randomised, prospective, phase-2 clinical trial, with six treatment arms (75 patients/arm, 450 patients). Primary objectives are to compare the safety and efficacy of two new proposed chemotherapy regimens of BZN and NFX in adults with CCD with the current SoC for BZN and NFX, evaluated by qPCR and biomarkers for 36 months posttreatment and correlated with CD conventional serology. Recruitment of patients was initiated on 18 December 2019 and on 20 May 2021, 450 patients (study goal) were randomised among the six treatment arms. The treatment phase was finalised on 18 August 2021. Secondary objectives include evaluation of population pharmacokinetics of both drugs in all treatment arms, the incidence of AEs, and parasite genotyping.

The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution and time-course of recovery of central and peripheral factors toward neuromuscular fatigue following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Sixteen male semi-professional soccer players completed a 90-min soccer match. Pre-, post- and at 24, 48, and 72 h participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during isometric knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (potentiated twitch force, Qtw, pot) function. Electromyography responses of the rectus femoris to single- and paired-pulse TMS were used to assess corticospinal excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), respectively. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through measures of jump (countermovement jump height and reactive strength index) and sprint performance. Results: Competitive match-play elicited significant post-match declines in MVC force (-14%, P < 0.001) that persisted for 48 h (-4%, P = 0.01), before recovering by 72 h post-exercise. VA (motor point stimulation) was reduced immediately post-match (-8%, P < 0.001), and remained depressed at 24 h (-5%, P = 0.01) before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. Qtw,pot was reduced post-match (-14%, P < 0.001), remained depressed at 24 h (-6%, P = 0.01), before recovering by 48 h post-exercise. No changes were evident in corticospinal excitability or SICI.

In the logistic regression analysis, it was found that those with a vitamin D level below 10 ng/mL had a 1.508-fold increased risk of COVID-19 compared to those who had 10 ng/mL and above (Odds ratio: 1.01-2.252). According to the risk analysis, those who have vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL are 1,224 times higher than those who have 20 ng/mL and above; those under 30 ng/mL were found to have an increased risk of 2.01 times compared to those of 30 ng/mL and above. CONCLUS?ONS: From the point of view of the literature data, we think that the findings we obtained may support researches that vitamin D level is significantly associated with both COVID-19 and other infections and many serious autoimmune and malignant diseases. As a result, rehabilitation programs on vitamin D deficiency should be organized and the society should be raised.

Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses, and the relationships between viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury. METHODS: Tissue was acquired from eleven detailed post-mortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral spike protein detection. Histological evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomical sites, and the pulmonary immune response characterized by multiplex immunofluorescence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal Covid-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterised as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred along with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in Covid-19, implicating a significant component of immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathology as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathological mechanisms, and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses as well as promoting pathogen tolerance in Covid-19.

The community lives in structural poverty and has a complex burden of infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Between March and May 2020, we conducted interviews, group discussions, and surveys, with members of the support group and their caregivers, frontline healthcare workers, and religious and community leaders.

Some community members received government food packages during the lockdown period. This support ended after lockdown in April and while anti-poverty COVID policies have been unveiled they have yet to be implemented. We discuss the impact of these representational, relational and power dynamics on the community's access to COVID-19 and NCD support.

Even so, most surgeons prefer an open technique. The aim of this systematic review was to compare short- and long-term outcomes after laparoscopic and open groin hernia repair in children. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted in three databases, and all randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic and open groin hernia repair in children under 18 years were included. Outcomes were postoperative complications, intraoperative complications, operative time, length of hospital stay, time to recovery, and wound appearance. The outcomes were compared between open and laparoscopic repairs in meta-analyses. RESULTS We included ten studies with 1270 patients involving 1392 hernias. We found no differences in recurrence rate, testicular atrophy, hydrocele, hematoma, seroma, infection, pain, length of hospital stay, or time to full recovery. Laparoscopic repair was superior regarding wound appearance. Laparoscopic repair had shorter operative time than open repair for bilateral groin hernias. For unilateral groin hernias, extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair was faster than open repair, but open repair was faster than intraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. CONCLUSION Our results indicate similar outcome after laparoscopic and open techniques for groin hernia repair in children.

Although COVID-19 is characterized mainly by diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure, in some cases COVID-19 may acquire extra-respiratory features, including renal dysfunction that has existed earlier or developed de novo. The reasons for the extra-respiratory manifestations are biological properties of SARS-CoV-2 based on its multiple organ tropism. It has been shown that at least 50% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have proteinuria, hematuria, and signs of renal dysfunction, which in some cases reaches the degree of acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we present a review that discusses the clinical aspects and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage in COVID-19. It is believed that renal damage observed in this disease is the result of a complex mechanism induced directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 with the development of acute kidney injury. Two main pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney damage in COVID-19 are discussed. The first of them is the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the renal epithelium with the development of acute tubulonecrosis. The second mechanism is the cytokine storm syndrome that results from hyperactivation of the immune system with the development of acute renal and multiorgan infl ammatory damage accompanied by hypoxia, persistent hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade, and microcirculation disorders. From a clinical point of view, it should be noted that signs of kidney damage are associated with an increase in the severity of COVID-19 and a poor outcome of the disease, and the prognosis becomes the worst with the development of AKI (the risk of death may increase by 5.3 times). The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with ESRD is higher than in the general population. The most typical for these patients is a severe course of the disease, which determines the increased mortality in comparison with the general population, caused by a respiratory failure with hyperactive infl ammation, cytokine storm, hemodynamic, and multiple organ failures. ? 2021 JSC Vidal Rus.

The data in this article provides demographics, home medications, in-hospital events and COVID-19 treatments, multivariable generalized linear regression regression models using a log link with a Poisson distribution (MLP) to determine predictors of new-onset atrial arrhythmias and mortality in COVID-19 patients, computerized tomography chest scan findings, echocardiographic findings, and International Classification of DiseasesCTenth Revision codes. The clinical outcomes were compared to a propensity-matched cohort of influenza patients. For influenza, data is reported on baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, and in-hospital events.

Although World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended any effective treatments for COVID-19, there are some reports about use of antiviral drugs. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Arbidol (ARB) on COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Using an open-label randomized controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of ARB in patients with COVID-19 in a teaching hospital. One hundred eligible patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited in the study and assigned randomly to two groups of either hydroxychloroquine followed by KALETRA (Lopinavir/ritonavir) or hydroxychloroquine followed by ARB. The primary outcome was hospitalization duration and clinical improvement 7 days after admission. The criteria of improvement were relief of cough, dyspnea, and fever. Time to relief from fever was also assessed across the two groups. Without any dropouts, 100 patients were entered into the study for the final analysis at significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56.6 (17.8) years and 56.2 (14.8) years in ARB and KALETRA groups, respectively. Majority of patients were male across two groups (66 and 54%). The duration of hospitalization in ARB group was significantly less than KALETRA arm (7.2 versus 9.6 days; P = 0.02). Time to relief fever was almost similar across two groups (2.7 versus 3.1 days in ARB and KALETRA arms, respectively). Peripheral oxygen saturation rate was significantly different after 7 days of admission across two groups (94% versus 92% in ARB and KALETRA groups respectively) (P = 0.02). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, IHD, Na level, and oxygen saturation at the time of admission and type of therapy were the independent adjusted variables that determined the duration of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that Arbidol, compared to KALETRA, significantly contributes to clinical and laboratory improvements, including peripheral oxygen saturation, requiring ICU admissions, duration of hospitalization, chest CT involvements, WBC, and ESR.

We propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds of positive cases.

However, there are currently few publications that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT: The study consisted in a literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the current status of their approval, and the data available on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this search, the document has been designed taking into account current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in these patients as in other individuals.

The rapid development, scale-up, and deployment of viral and antibody detection methods since the beginning of the pandemic have greatly increased testing capacity. Desirable attributes of detection methods are low product costs, self-administered protocols, and the ability to be mailed in sealed envelopes for the safe analysis and subsequent logging to public health databases. Herein, such a platform is demonstrated with a screen-printed, inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator as a transducer and a toehold switch coupled with cell-free expression as the biological selective recognition element. In the presence of the N-gene from SARS-CoV-2, the toehold switch relaxes, protease enzyme is expressed, and it degrades a gelatin switch that ultimately shifts the resonant frequency of the planar resonant sensor. The gelatin switch resonator (GSR) can be analyzed through a sealed envelope allowing for assessment without the need for careful sample handling with personal protective equipment or the need for workup with other reagents. The toehold switch used in this sensor demonstrated selectivity to SARS-CoV-2 virus over three seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-1, with a limit of detection of 100 copies/L. The functionality of the platform and assessment in a sealed envelope with an automated scanner is shown with overnight shipment, and further improvements are discussed to increase signal stability and further simplify user protocols toward a mail-in platform.","output":"Toward Mail-in-Sensors for SARS-CoV-2 Detection: Interfacing Gel Switch Resonators with Cell-Free Toehold Switches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nos ltimos anos, o biomaterial de quitosana tem sido bastante utilizado, tendo o fio derivado deste, caractersticas de ser absorvvel por hidrlise, indutor de discreta resposta tecidual, bacteriosttico e monofilamentar.

Considering the repercussion of these unique social experiences in infant's health, this study aims to assess the early impact of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic in hospital admissions for acute bronchiolitis. METHODS: Data from hospitalizations of acute bronchiolitis in infants under one year were obtained from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health database (DATASUS) for the period between 2016 and 2020. These data were also analyzed by macro-regions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South and Midwest). To evaluate the effect of social distancing strategy on the incidence of acute bronchiolitis, the absolute and relative reduction was calculated by analyzing the yearly subsets of 2016vs2020, 2017vs2020, 2018vs2020, and 2019vs2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in all comparisons, ranging from -78% [IRR 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)] in 2016vs2020 at -85% [IRR 0.15 (0.13 to 0.16)] in 2019vs2020, for the data from Brazil. For analyzes by macro-regions, the reduction varied from -58% [IRR 0.41 (0.37 to 0.45)] in the Midwest in 2016vs2020 to -93% [IRR 0.07 (0.06 to 0.08)] in the South in 2019vs2020. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in hospitalization for acute bronchiolitis in children under one year old, in Brazil, of the order of more than 70% for most analysis. Our data suggest an important impact of social distance on reducing the transmission of viruses related to acute bronchiolitis. Such knowledge may guide strategies for prevention of viruses spread.","output":"Early Impact of Social Distancing in Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Hospitalizations for Acute Bronchiolitis in Infants in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In critical self-reflection from an African context on the pandemic, COVID-19 is first semantically re-baptized as Christianity-On-Verges: Inciting Discussion, with a subsequent discussion in broad outlines of the thematic foci of the most recent South African publications on the pandemic.

A growing body of evidence suggests that low expression of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) promotes the transmission of -synuclein (-Syn) interpolymers and the progression of PD. However, how GBA mutations affect the pathogenesis of PD via abnormal aggregation of -Syn is unclear, and no clinically valid PD-MCI genetic markers have been identified. Here, we first located a GBA eQTL, rs12411216, by analysing DHS, eQTL SNP, and transcription factor binding site data using the UCSC database. Subsequently, we found that rs12411216 was significantly associated with PD-MCI (P < 0.05) in 306 PD patients by genotyping. In exploring the relationship between rs12411216 and GBA expression, the SNP was found to be associated with GBA expression in 50 PD patients through qPCR verification. In a further CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing module, the SNP was identified to cause a decrease in GBA expression, weaken enzymatic activity and enhance the abnormal aggregation of -Syn in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we confirmed that the binding efficiency of transcription factor E2F4 was affected by the rs12411216 SNP. In conclusion, our results showed that rs12411216 regulated GBA expression, supporting its potential role as a PD-MCI genetic biomarker and highlighting novel mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease.","output":"Characterization of a pathogenic variant in GBA for Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities, governments, and legislators around the world have implemented temporary changes to the scopes of practice for various health disciplines Our aim was to identify opportunities for collaboration both within and across professional groups by using bibliometrics to compare scope-of-practice scholarship among and within disciplines We conducted a bibliometric analysis using quantitative analytical tools provided by Scopus and examined the growth in both the quality and quantity of scholarship across several disciplines We identified a total of 80 clusters of research, noting differences among the lines of inquiry relating to scope of practice in the various disciplines Although medicine has contributed the greatest volume of articles (2,921) to the corpus of work (4,619), physiotherapy and nursing have contributed proportionately, by percentage, the most research-based content (95 5% and 88 5%, respectively) The foci of interest in one discipline may help disciplines with a less comprehensive research base to advance their scholarship more rapidly Furthermore, this study has postulated a potential methodological opportunity to compare research output across disciplines or specific areas of study based on a linkage between Bradford's Law of scattering and Jenks's analysis of natural breaks","output":"Contrasting Views on Scope of Practice: A Bibliometric Analysis of Allied Health, Nursing, and Medical Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the LOVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

This study aims to assess the scalability of a multi-component integrated falls prevention service for community-dwelling older people and to examine the applicability of the Intervention Scalability Assessment Tool (ISAT). The ISAT consists of 10 domains for consideration when determining the scalability of an intervention, and each domain comprises a series of questions aimed at examining readiness for scale-up. METHODS: Multiple methods were used sequentially as recommended by the ISAT: a review of policy documents, results from a service evaluation and falls-related literature; one-to-one interviews (n = 11) with key stakeholders involved in management and oversight of the service; and a follow-up online questionnaire (n = 10) with stakeholders to rate scalability and provide further feedback on reasons for their scores. RESULTS: Three of the ISAT domains were rated highly by the participants. Analysis of the qualitative feedback and documents indicated that the issue of falls prevention among older people was of sufficient priority to warrant scale-up of the service and that the service aligned with national health policy priorities. Some participants also noted that benefits of the service could potentially outweigh costs through reduced hospital admissions and serious injuries such as hip fracture. The remaining domains received a moderate score from participants, however, indicating considerable barriers to scale-up. In the qualitative feedback, barriers identified included the perceived need for more healthcare staff to deliver components of the service, for additional infrastructure such as adequate room space, and for an integrated electronic patient management system linking primary and secondary care and to prevent duplication of services. CONCLUSIONS: Plans to scale up the service are currently under review given the practical barriers that need to be addressed. The ISAT provides a systematic and structured framework for examining the scalability of this multi-component falls prevention intervention, although the iterative nature of the process and detailed and technical nature of its questions require considerable time and knowledge of the service to complete.

Laboratory and radiologic studies provide critical information on disease severity, management options, and overall prognosis. Medical management is mostly supportive with antipyretics, hydration, oxygen supplementation, and other measures as dictated by clinical need.

This has been the driving force for MS to play a predominant role in lipidomics. However, elucidation of the detailed lipid structures, especially the location of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), remains challenging for MS-based lipid analysis workflows.

The PB reaction can be conducted online in ~30 s, which transforms a C=C into the oxetane ring structure.

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson's correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people's movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the \\"new normal standard of life\\" following health guidelines and social distancing.

We aimed to objectively measure differences in mood reports before and after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in rural older Veterans. Participants age > 62 were enrolled in the Collaborative Aging Research using Technology (CART) initiative, a NIH and VA HSRD funded multi-site study examining the feasibility of unobtrusive remote sensing and monitoring of physical, cognitive, and health-related activities. The VA CART site consists of Pacific Northwest Veteran volunteers and their cohabitants. Weekly online health forms including questions about blue mood and loneliness were collected January C July 2020. A COVID stay-at-home order was instituted March 13 2020. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with logit link was used to investigate differences in mood reports pre- and post- stay-at-home orders. 100 older volunteers completed 2441 health reports (mean age 71.2 years, 41% female, 19% single). Thirty-five percent were urban, 34% large rural, and 31% small rural using rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) scores urban: 1-3; large rural 4-6; small rural 7-10. After adjusting for covariates, incidence of blue mood and loneliness reports were significantly higher after stay-at-home orders (OR=4.4, p<0.0001 and OR=7.2, p<0.0001 respectively). Results varied by rurality with large rural volunteers showing the largest increases. Real-world monitoring of weekly health reports may identify those at greatest risk for depression and social isolation in older Veterans and their cohabitants and is of particular relevance in rural settings, where access to specialty care is limited.","output":"Increased Blue Mood and Loneliness during COVID-19 Pandemic in a Veteran Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical characteristics of critically ill COVID-19 patients co-infected with influenza. METHODS: In this study, we included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 form Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), with or without influenza, and compared their clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Among 93 patients, 44 died and 49 were discharged. Forty-four (47.3%) were infected with influenza virus A and 2 (2.2%) with influenza virus B. Twenty-two (50.0%) of the non-survivors and 24 (49.0%) of the survivors were infected with the influenza virus. Critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza were more prone to cardiac injury than those without influenza. For the laboratory indicators at admission, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of tumor necrosis factor-, D-dimer value, and proportion of elevated creatinine were higher in non-survivors with influenza than in those without influenza. CONCLUSION: The results showed a high proportion of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with influenza in Tongji Hospital, with no significant difference in the proportion of co-infection between survivors and non-survivors. The critically ill COVID-19 patients with influenza exhibited more severe inflammation and organ injury, indicating that co-infection with the influenza virus may induce an earlier and more frequently occurring cytokine storm.","output":"Clinical Characteristics of Critically Ill Patients Co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the Influenza Virus in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

Medical personnel are frontline workers who must have contact with individuals in quarantine and are thus at higher risk of infection. As a reference for future recruitment, this study investigated why some medical personnel volunteer to care for individuals in GQF. Methods: The researchers used purposive sampling to recruit participants from a GQF in northern Taiwan. Focus group interviews were administered. The consistency of the interview outline content was 91%. After the interviews, content analysis was performed to examine and summarize the data. The data were coded before comparison, categorization and summarization, producing various core categories. Results: A total of 12 participants voluntarily attended our interviews, compromising 4 men and 8 women, with an average age of 48.1 6.4 years and an average length of service in GQF of 82.1  77.1 days. Our study results revealed four aspects and six reasons that affect the voluntary participation of medical personnel in epidemic prevention tasks. The first aspect was meeting safety needs, and the reasons included sufficient personal protective equipment, complete standard operating procedures, and orientation training and in-service education and training. The second aspect was meeting the needs of love and belonging, and the reason included a good working atmosphere. The third aspect was meeting the need for self-esteem, and the reason included Taiwan's previous SARS epidemic prevention experience. Finally, the fourth aspect was meeting the need for selfrealization, and the reason was based on the humanistic concern. Conclusions: At the time of the coronavirus outbreak, various countries reported insufficient medical personnel or personnel unwilling to participate in epidemic prevention work. Our results revealed that if the environment met the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it can attract medical personnel to volunteer in GQF tasks. In formulating policies, the needs must be met at all levels, so that medical staff would be willing to participate in epidemic prevention work. ? 2021 Chinese Public Health Association of Taiwan.

Indeed, vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a potential preventative or therapeutic strategy. Recommendations for any intervention, particularly in the context of a potentially fatal pandemic infection, should be strictly based on clinically informed appraisal of the evidence base. In this narrative review, we examine current evidence relating to vitamin D and COVID-19 and consider the most appropriate practical recommendations. OBSERVATIONS: Although there are a growing number of studies investigating the links between vitamin D and COVID-19, they are mostly small and observational with high risk of bias, residual confounding, and reverse causality. Extrapolation of molecular actions of 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D to an effect of increased 25(OH)-vitamin D as a result of vitamin D supplementation is generally unfounded, as is the automatic conclusion of causal mechanisms from observational studies linking low 25(OH)-vitamin D to incident disease. Efficacy is ideally demonstrated in the context of adequately powered randomised intervention studies, although such approaches may not always be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: At present, evidence to support vitamin D supplementation for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 is inconclusive. In the absence of any further compelling data, adherence to existing national guidance on vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D deficiency, predicated principally on maintaining musculoskeletal health, appears appropriate.","output":"Vitamin D and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): rapid evidence review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Establishing intravenous access is essential but may be difficult to achieve for patients requiring isolation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of infrared vein visualizer on the peripheral intravenous catheter therapy in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A nonrandomized clinical trial was performed. One-hundred and twenty-two COVID-19 patients that required peripheral intravenous cannulation were divided into two groups with 60 in the control group and 62 in the intervention group. Conventional venipuncture method was applied to the control group while infrared vein imaging device was applied in the intervention group. The first attempt success rate, total procedure time and patients satisfaction score were compared between two groups using chi-square, t-test, and z-test (also known as Mann-Whitney U test) statistics. RESULTS: The first attempt success rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of control group (91.94% vs 76.67%, ?2=5.41, P=0.02). The procedure time was shorter in the intervention group (M=211.44, SD=68.58 seconds vs M=388.27, SD=88.97 seconds, t=12.27, P<0.001). Patients from the intervention group experienced higher degree of satisfaction (7.5 vs 6, z=-3.31, P<0.001).

On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection.

A key variable predicted by early warning systems is the final outbreak size. However, for directly transmitted diseases, the stochastic contact process by which outbreaks develop entails fundamental limits to the precision with which the final size can be predicted. METHODS AND FINDINGS: I studied how the expected final outbreak size and the coefficient of variation in the final size of outbreaks scale with control effectiveness and the rate of infectious contacts in the simple stochastic epidemic. As examples, I parameterized this model with data on observed ranges for the basic reproductive ratio (R (0)) of nine directly transmitted diseases. I also present results from a new model, the simple stochastic epidemic with delayed-onset intervention, in which an initially supercritical outbreak (R (0) > 1) is brought under control after a delay. CONCLUSION: The coefficient of variation of final outbreak size in the subcritical case (R (0) < 1) will be greater than one for any outbreak in which the removal rate is less than approximately 2.41 times the rate of infectious contacts, implying that for many transmissible diseases precise forecasts of the final outbreak size will be unattainable. In the delayed-onset model, the coefficient of variation (CV) was generally large (CV > 1) and increased with the delay between the start of the epidemic and intervention, and with the average outbreak size. These results suggest that early warning systems for infectious diseases should not focus exclusively on predicting outbreak size but should consider other characteristics of outbreaks such as the timing of disease emergence.","output":"Limits to Forecasting Precision for Outbreaks of Directly Transmitted Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on the relationship between the clinical and microbiological features of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and its computed tomography (CT) findings are limited.

METHODS: Patients with CAP who underwent a CT scan at presentation were retrospectively classified using CT findings into consolidation, GGO and bronchiolitis groups. These 3 groups were compared in terms of clinical parameters and microbiological data. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (2.4%) were allocated to the bronchiolitis group and 46 (2.8%) to the GGO group. The most common pathogen in the bronchiolitis group was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was significantly more frequently isolated in this group.

The PLACE-19 Study was carried out in a population-based sample of 2448 secondary school students sampled across the country (random quota sampling). Food preferences (including the preference for vegetables, fruit, meat/fish, dairy, snacks, and starches) of the adolescents were assessed using the validated Food Preference Questionnaire (FPQ) while their appetitive traits (hunger, food responsiveness, emotional overeating, enjoyment of food, satiety responsiveness, emotional undereating, food fussiness, slowness in eating) were assessed using the validated Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ). The k-means clustering was performed to identify the homogenous clusters of respondents based on their preferences, and linear regression was performed to determine the relationship between food preferences and appetitive traits with a model adjusted for sex and age. Based on their preferences, three homogenous clusters of respondents were defined: low-preferring respondents (low preference for all food categories), respondents preferring snacking foods (low preference for all food categories, except for fruit and snacks), and high-preferring respondents (high preference for all food categories). The low-preferring respondents showed the lowest values for all appetitive traits (p = 0.0008), as well as the lowest total score (p = 0.0001), except for food fussiness, for which they showed the highest value (p = 0.0008). All preference scores were positively associated with traits such as hunger, food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, and emotional under-eating, while negatively associated with food fussiness (all p < 0.05).

Moreover, thanks to the advances in scientific knowledge and higher availability, there has been increasing use of positive pressure mechanical ventilation which has its implications on the heart. Therefore, there is a growing need for Cardiac intensivists to quickly, noninvasively and repeatedly evaluate various hemodynamic conditions and the response to therapy. Transthoracic critical care echocardiography (CCE) currently represents an essential tool in CICU, as it is used to evaluate biventricular function and complications following acute coronary syndromes, identify the mechanisms of circulatory failure, acute valvular pathologies, tailoring and titrating intravenous treatment or mechanical circulatory support. This could be completed with trans-esophageal echocardiography (TOE), advanced echocardiography and lung ultrasound to provide a thorough evaluation and monitoring of CICU patients. However, CCE could sometimes be challenging as the acquisition of good-quality images is limited by mechanical ventilation, suboptimal patient position or recent surgery with drains on the chest. Moreover, there are some technical caveats that one should bear in mind while performing CCE in order to optimize its use and avoid misleading findings. The aim of this review is to highlight the key role of CCE, providing an updated overview of its main applications and possible pitfalls in order to facilitate its use in CICU for clinical decision-making.","output":"Echocardiography in the intensive care unit: An essential tool for diagnosis, monitoring and guiding clinical decision-making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory illness that has emerged as a devastating health problem worldwide. The disease outcome is heterogeneous, and severity is likely dependent on the immunity of infected individuals and comorbidities. Although symptoms of the disease are primarily associated with respiratory problems, additional infection or failure of other vital organs are being reported. Emerging reports suggest a quite common co-existence of gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms in addition to respiratory symptoms in many COVID-19 patients, and some patients show just the GI symptoms. The possible cause of the GI symptoms could be due to direct infection of the epithelial cells of the gut, which is supported by the fact that (1) The intestinal epithelium expresses a high level of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 protein that are required for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into the cells; (2) About half of the severe COVID-19 patients show viral RNA in their feces and various parts of the GI tract; and (3) SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect gut epithelial cells in vitro (gut epithelial cells and organoids) and in vivo (rhesus monkey). The GI tract seems to be a site of active innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 as clinically, stool samples of COVID-19 patients possess proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 8), calprotectin (neutrophils activity), and immunoglobulin A antibodies. In addition to direct immune activation by the virus, impairment of GI epithelium integrity can evoke immune response under the influence of systemic cytokines, hypoxia, and changes in gut microbiota (dysbiosis) due to infection of the respiratory system, which is confirmed by the observation that not all of the GI symptomatic patients are viral RNA positive. This review comprehensively summarizes the possible GI immunomodulation by SARS-CoV-2 that could lead to GI symptoms, their association with disease severity, and potential therapeutic interventions.","output":"COVID-19 and gut immunomodulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opticin is a class III member of the extracellular matrix small leucine-rich repeat protein/proteoglycan (SLRP) family found in vitreous humour and cartilage. It was first identified associated with the surface of vitreous collagen fibrils and several other SLRPs are also known to bind collagen fibrils and it some cases alter fibril morphology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the binding of opticin to the collagen II-containing fibrils found in vitreous and cartilage. Electron microscopic studies using gold labelling demonstrated that opticin binds vitreous and thin cartilage collagen fibrils specifically at a single site in the gap region of the collagen D-period corresponding to the e2 stain band; this is the first demonstration of the binding site of a class III SLRP on collagen fibrils. Opticin did not bind thick cartilage collagen fibrils from cartilage or tactoids formed in vitro from collagen II, but shows high specificity for thin, heterotypic collagen fibrils containing collagens II, and XI or V/XI. Vitreous collagen fibrils from opticin null and wild-type mice were compared and no difference in fibril morphology or diameter was observed. Similarly, in vitro fibrillogenesis experiments showed that opticin did not affect fibril formation. We propose that when opticin is bound to collagen fibrils, rather than influencing their morphology it instead hinders the binding of other molecules to the fibril surfaces and/or act as an intermediary bridge linking the collagen fibrils to other non-collagenous molecules.","output":"Analysis of opticin binding to collagen fibrils identifies a single binding site in the gap region and a high specificity towards thin heterotypic fibrils containing collagens II, and XI or V/XI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is perhaps inevitable that the academic study of learning disabilities is often undertaken by established scholars with little lived experience of the condition. So, what has it been like for someone from outside the academy, with a long career in the arts, who is also the father of a severely learning-disabled young man, to write a book-length history of learning disabilities in culture and society? How is it possible to reconcile such a biological reality with the many caveats about the social construction of the condition? How can we retain a belief in scientific analysis when the categorisation of learning-disabled people seems to have caused as many problems as it solves? Furthermore, how can such an account be attempted when so much of the written record is by people who are placed in positions of power over learning-disabled people and when the true voice of experience is so often silenced, or, like the author's son, silent? The attempt to answer these questions reveals a field rich with contradiction. Despite some advances, much of the social and cultural history of learning disabilities tells a tale of neglect, abandonment and abuse, with confused cultural attitudes too often shaping practice. When the telescope is reversed, however, severe learning disabilities provide us with a kind of Brechtian \\"alienation effect\\" which reveals the fault lines running through so many progressive movements and helps us to frame them historically, while also challenging assumptions about how those with severe learning disabilities are regarded and can best be given the support and freedom that they need.","output":"Writing a history of learning disabilities as Joey's dad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon- and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to a satisfactory result.

Based on an analysis of 10,395 research publications about SARS-CoV-2 that mention at least one human gene, we report here that the COVID-19 literature up to mid-October 2020 follows a similar pattern.

To date there has not been a comparison between open and laparoscopic operations using the OS-MRS. OBJECTIVE To determine whether there are differences in mortality risk between open and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) using the OS-MRS. SETTING Three university-affiliated hospitals. METHODS The 90-day mortality of 2467 consecutive patients who had primary open (1574) or laparoscopic (893) RYGB performed by one surgeon was determined. Univariate and multivariate analysis using 5 OS-MRS risk factors including body mass index (BMI) gender, age>45, presence of hypertension and preoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk was performed in each group. Each patient was placed in 1 of 3 OS-MRS risk classes based on the number of risks: A (0-1), B (2-3), and C (4-5). RESULTS Preoperative BMI and DVT risk factors were significantly greater in the open group (OG). Preoperative age was significantly greater in the laparoscopic group (LG). There were significantly more class B and C patients in LG. Ninety-day mortality rates for OG and LG patients were 1.0% and .9%, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was the most common cause of death. All deaths in LG occurred during first 4 years of that experience. Mortality rate by class was A = .1%; B = 1.5%; C = 2.3%. The difference in mortality between class B and C patients was not significant. Univariate analysis in the OG indicated that BMI, age, gender, and DVT risk were significant predictors of mortality. In the LG only BMI and DVT were significant predictors of death. Presence of hypertension was not a significant predictor in either group. Multivariate analysis excluding hypertension found that age was predictive of mortality in the OG while BMI (P = .057) and gender (P = .065) approached statistical significance. Conversely, only BMI was predictive of mortality in the LG with age approaching significance (P = .058). In multivariate analysis DVT risk was not predictive of mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS There are significant differences in the predictive value of the OS-MRS between open and laparoscopic RYGB. Although laparoscopic patients were significantly older versus the open patients, age was not predictive of mortality after laparoscopic RYGB. BMI trended toward increased mortality risk in both groups. Changes in technique and protocol likely contributed toward no mortality during the last 6 years of our laparoscopic experience.","output":"Differences in open versus laparoscopic gastric bypass mortality risk using the Obesity Surgery Mortality Risk Score (OS-MRS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In Spain, Home Care as a fundamental tool of Primary Health Care, has had uneven development both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it initially played a relevant role in the control and monitoring of infected people and their families. However, at no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.","output":"ATENCIN DOMICILIARIA Y COVID-19.

METHODS This retrospective study was undertaken in a tertiary care epilepsy center in India. Consecutive patients with EE who had received IVMP as adjunctive therapy for a minimum of 3 months and had at least one pre-and post-steroid EEG each, were identified and a structured questionnaire was used to collect information including outcomes at 3 months post-steroid course completion and beyond, as available. RESULTS Ninety-seven patients (M:F=71:26) fulfilling the inclusion criteria with a mean age at onset of seizures being 20.52  25.69 months were included. Commonest seizure types were myoclonic (66%); Lennaux-Gastaut and West Syndromes accounted for 57 % and 24 % patients respectively. The etiology was unknown in 52 %. All children were on a combination of standard anti-seizure drugs. The duration of IVMP pulse therapy was 7.72  6.25 months. One-fourth (26 %) patients experienced minor adverse events. Greater than 50 % seizure burden reduction was seen in 66 % patients at 3 months with seizure-freedom in 25 %. A total of 45 (46 %) patients became seizure-free in the cohort eventually with continuation of steroids beyond 3 months. Children with idiopathic EEs, normal neuroimaging, myoclonic jerks, and West syndrome showed the best response. The presence of burst-suppression and generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) predicted inadequate response. CONCLUSIONS Adjunct pulse doses of IVMP are safe, well-tolerated, and effective in reducing seizures and improving global outcomes in children with idiopathic EEs, West syndrome, normal neuroimaging, and myoclonic jerks. Seizure freedom might be delayed in a subset of these patients, hence duration of therapy beyond 3 months may be warranted.","output":"Role of pulse methylprednisolone in epileptic encephalopathy: A retrospective observational analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Nrf2-Keap1-ARE pathway is the principal regulator of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes. Its activation increases the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective proteins, protecting cells against infections. Nrf2 modulates virus-induced oxidative stress, ROS generation, and disease pathogenesis, which are vital in the viral life cycle. During respiratory viral infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an inflammatory process, and oxidative stress of the epithelium lining cells activate the transcription factor Nrf2, which protects cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Nrf2 reduces angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expression in respiratory epithelial cells. SARS-CoV2 has a high affinity for ACE2 that works as receptors for coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein, facilitating viral entry. Disease severity may also be modulated by pre-existing conditions, such as impaired immune response, obesity, and age, where decreased level of Nrf2 is a common feature. Consequently, Nrf2 activators may increase Nrf2 levels and enhance antiviral mediators expression, which could initiate an antiviral state, priming cells against viral infection. Therefore, this hypothesis paper describes the use of flavonoid supplements combined with vitamin D3 to activate Nrf2, which may be a potential target to prevent and/or decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, enhancing innate immunity, and downregulating ACE2 receptors.","output":"Flavonoids activation of the transcription factor NRF2 as a hypothesis approach for the prevention and modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has seriously endangered the health and lives of Chinese people. In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of PM remain unclear. Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for 24 hours to PM(2.5-1) (particle aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 2.5m) and subsequently for an additional 24 hours to lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR3), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR7/8) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM(2.5-1) produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR4 ligand than cells exposed to PM(2.5-1) or bacterial ligand alone. On the contrary, PM(2.5-1) exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR3 and TLR7/8. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G2-M phase arrest.

Some centers have reported very high rates of thrombosis despite anticoagulant prophylaxis. Methods: The electronic health record (EHR) of a New Orleans-based health system was searched for all patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were either admitted to hospital or treated and discharged from an emergency department between March 1 and May 1, 2020. From this cohort, patients with confirmed VTE (either during or after their hospital encounter) were identified by administrative query of the EHR. Results: Between March 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020, 6,153 patients with COVID-19 were identified; 2,748 of these patients were admitted, while 3,405 received care exclusively through the emergency department. Data on patient outcomes were determined up until and including May 21, 2020. In total, 637 patients required mechanical ventilation and 206 required renal replacement therapy. Within the hospitalized cohort, the overall mortality rate was 24.5% and VTE occurred in 86 patients (3.1%). In the 637 patients who required mechanical ventilation at some point during their hospital stay, 45 developed VTE (7.2%). After a median follow-up of 14.6 days, VTE had been diagnosed in 3 of the 2,075 admitted who were discharged alive (0.14%). Conclusions: Among 6,153 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized or treated in emergency departments, we did not find evidence of unusually high VTE risk. Pending further evidence from prospective, controlled trials, our findings support a traditional approach to primary VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.

One of its main characteristics is that the pool of infected people is not assumed to be homogeneously mixed, but rather as a passage into which individuals enter upon contagion, move within it in a plug-flow manner and leave at recovery, within a fixed time period. So, the present model differs conceptually in the way it describes the dynamics of infection. An infection unit is defined as the amount of COVID-19 virus that generates contagion, if it reaches a susceptible individual. This model separately considers various pools: symptomatic and asymptomatic infected patients; three different pools of recovered individuals; pools of assisted, hospitalized patients; the quarantined and, finally, those who died from COVID-19. The transmission of the disease from an infected person to others is described by an infection rate function, while an encounter frequency function modulates the frequency of effective encounters between the infected and the susceptible. The influence of the model parameters on the predicted results is presented. The effect of social restrictions and of quarantine policy on pandemic spread is shown. For model calibration, a set of experimental data is used. The model enables the calculation of the actual behaviour of the studied pools during pandemic spread.

METHODS: To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. RESULTS: Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590,000 and 60,000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple data sources and cross validation of a COVID-19 epidemic model, coupled with a medical resource logistic model, revealed the key factors that affect epidemic progressions and their outbreak patterns in different countries. These key factors are the type of emergency medical response to avoid runs on medical resources, especially improved detection rates, the ability to promote public health measures, and the synergistic effects of combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs, and staff.","output":"Effects of medical resource capacities and intensities of public mitigation measures on outcomes of COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vast majority of intracellular protein targets are refractory toward small-molecule therapeutic engagement, and additional therapeutic modalities are needed to overcome this deficiency. Here, the identification and characterization of a natural product, WDB002, reveals a therapeutic modality that dramatically expands the currently accepted limits of druggability. WDB002, in complex with the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), potently and selectively binds the human centrosomal protein 250 (CEP250), resulting in disruption of CEP250 function in cells. The recognition mode is unprecedented in that the targeted domain of CEP250 is a coiled coil and is topologically featureless, embodying both a structural motif and surface topology previously considered on the extreme limits of undruggability for an intracellular target. Structural studies reveal extensive proteinCWDB002 and proteinCprotein contacts, with the latter being distinct from those seen in FKBP12 ternary complexes formed by FK506 and rapamycin. Outward-facing structural changes in a bound small molecule can thus reprogram FKBP12 to engage diverse, otherwise undruggable targets. The flat-targeting modality demonstrated here has the potential to expand the druggable target range of small-molecule therapeutics. As CEP250 was recently found to be an interaction partner with the Nsp13 protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease, it is possible that WDB002 or an analog may exert useful antiviral activity through its ability to form high-affinity ternary complexes containing CEP250 and FKBP12.","output":"Genomic discovery of an evolutionarily programmed modality for small-molecule targeting of an intractable protein surface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Baclofen and morphine have shown efficacy against mechanical allodynia after infraorbital nerve chronic constriction injury (IoN-CCI). No drug effects have yet been reported on spontaneous trigeminal neuropathic pain. It has been proposed that the directed face grooming behavior that also develops following IoN-CCI offers a measure of spontaneous trigeminal neuropathic pain. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We examined the effects of a continuous 1-week infusion of 30 mg/day carbamazepine (the first-line drug treatment for trigeminal neuralgia), 1.06 mg/day baclofen, 4.18 mg/day clomipramine, and 5 mg/day morphine on spontaneous and mechanically evoked pain behavior (ie, directed face grooming and von Frey testing) in IoN-CCI rats. RESULTS Isolated face grooming was significantly reduced in rats receiving carbamazepine and baclofen but not in clomipramine- or morphine-treated rats. All drugs showed significant antiallodynic effects; carbamazepine showed the strongest effects, whereas clomipramine had only minor efficacy. CONCLUSION The tested drugs have differential effects in the IoN-CCI model, and different neuropathological mechanisms may underlie the different somatosensory symptoms in this model. A mechanism-based approach may be needed to treat (trigeminal) neuropathic pain.

The switch to distance learning resulted in a significant increase in the number of responses related to feeling ill or sick due to inadequate temperature (from 24% before a lockdown to 32% after the introduction of a lockdown). Students experienced temporary surges in their overall living costs due to the pandemic, especially during the first wave. The respondents who experienced inappropriate temperatures (inadequate heating) due to excessive costs felt ill or became sick more often than others. The study demonstrated that those who pay more for energy (defined as a surplus payment in excess of 10%) tended to be, on average, less energy-aware than others. The following indicators of energy poverty among the students were distinguished: high living costs, small degree of influence over the choice of living quarters, as well as concerns over energy efficiency and environment. The conclusions drawn from the conducted studies may be utilized to design public policies aimed at curtailing the phenomenon of energy poverty among students.

Better quantification of these conditions, specifically, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, is desired for future diagnostics, treatment modalities, and gaining a further understanding of PASC. This research has led to application of a novel autonomic activity tracking algorithm and GUI suite from previous work, see Figure 1, to study the physiological autonomic activity in six patients who had recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection a mean of six months prior but were still experiencing symptoms. By measuring skin sympathetic nervous activity (SKNA), heart rate variability, and the cutaneous electrogastrogram (EGG), all before and after a water meal challenge, the data was fed into a custom analysis pipeline, shown in Figure 1. Each of the PASC patients were compared to a mean response of 34 healthy controls, each undergoing a 20-minute baseline recording and another 20-minute recording after ingestion of an 8 oz water test meal. All six patients showed significantly abnormal heart rate variability on frequency domain analysis in predominantly the low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) bands, and less so in the high frequency (HF) band, suggesting sympathetic nerve dysfunction. Three patients showed a significant decrease in SKNA while two showed a significant increase. All patients showed an abnormal cutaneous EGG. As shown in Figure 2, the temporal responses of aSKNA, VLF, LF, HF, and EGG for the PASC patients revealed that on average they were statistically different (p<0.05) from the healthy controls' responses respectively during 98.4%, 78.4%, 86.76%, 47.9%, and 86.1% of the 40-minute time period in testing, 20 minutes of baseline and 20 minutes after ingestion. In conclusion, we are looking at the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems synced temporally for applications with classification and further stratification of PASC based on the temporal dynamics of their autonomic nervous system mediated coordination from digestion. This shows that SARS-CoV02 infection appears to have a significant effect on sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system function and may be responsible for the disturbances noted in PASC.

METHODS An online survey was completed by 335 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in 'video manipulation' techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video calls (ie, on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video use behaviors were associated with greater body image disturbance. RESULTS Over 1/3 of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, greater engagement in video manipulation behaviors, and increasing appearance concerns due to their time on video calls. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty treatments (eg, waxing) and aesthetic procedures (eg, non-surgical procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections).

We undertook a systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of a total of 55 articles on arterial and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and articles on previous pandemics with respect to thromboembolism and compared the similarities and differences between them. The presence of thrombosis in multiple organ systems points to thromboembolism being an integral component in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thromboembolism is likely to be the main player in the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19 in which the pulmonary system is most severely affected. We also hypothesize that D-dimer values could be used as an early marker for prognostication of disease as it has been seen to be raised even in the pre-symptomatic stage.

We aimed to evaluate whether migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic differed from pre-COVID-19, and explore their possible influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD: This prospective cohort study enrolled 187 migraine patients who came from the Department of Neurology of West China Hospital from October 2019 to December 2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 157 patients were included. We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics and epidemiological contact information and followed up on March 2020. Then Paired-Samples T test, logistic regression and interaction tests were used to analyze data. RESULT: We found that value of migraine attack frequency was 2.47  1.12 before and 3.54  1.79 during COVID-19 (P<0.0001). Then we divided patients into two group based on the difference of migraine attack frequency between COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 and employed logistic regression analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, divorced status (OR=6.53, P=0.0453), good sleep pre-COVID-19 and poor sleep during COVID-19 (OR=3.11, P=0.0432) had independent effect on migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic. And we found no interaction in the poor sleep during COVID-19 between various subgroups. CONCLUSION: Migraineurs may suffer from more frequent migraine attack during COVID-19 pandemic.

AIM Our goal was to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on Hungarian acute ischemic stroke care. METHOD We compared demographical and clinical characteristics, rate of intravenous and endovascular therapies and therapeutic time parameters of acute ischemic strokes admitted to a university stroke centre in a COVID-epidemic period (01/03/2020-30/04/2020) and an identical period of 2019. RESULTS 86 patients were admitted during the COVID-period and 97 in the control period. Demographical and clinical characteristics of these periods were well-balanced. In the COVID-period, the proportion of patients arriving beyond 24 hours after onset increased by 13% (p = 0.046), the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged (8%), the rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased from 26% to 16%, the mean onset-to-treatment time of thrombolysis increased by 20 minutes, while the mean door-to-treatment time increased by only 5 minutes. Behind the shift of arrival time categories, multivariable (year of examination, NIHSS, age) logistic regression shows that the year of examination might play a leading role (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION In the COVID-period, admissions for acute ischemic strokes decreased by 11% and the proportion of cases certainly untreatable by reperfusion therapies (arriving beyond 24 hours after onset) increased significantly. While the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged, the absolute rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased by 10% and the mean onset-to-treatment time showed a tendency to increase. In these changes, the COVID-epidemic itself and related out-of-hospital factors might play a leading role.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments. Retaining clinical equipoise regarding treatment will allow clinicians to enroll children in robust clinical trials to determine the optimal treatment for this novel important condition.","output":"Association Between Treatments and Short-Term Biochemical Improvements and Clinical Outcomes in Post-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Inflammatory Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the most common disease leading to blindness in extreme preterm infants. Current screening guidelines recommend frequent eye examinations. There is a dearth of trained ophthalmologists for these frequent screening procedures. The ANZNN neonatal network report (2013) found that only 6.4% of all screened infants had severe ROP and less than half received treatment. WINROP (online prediction model, Sweden) uses the postnatal weight gain (surrogate marker for low insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 and poor retinal vascular growth) to identify ROP requiring treatment and aims to reduce the number of examinations. Our objective was to validate the WINROP model in an Australian cohort of preterm infants. METHODS Birth weight, gestational age, and weekly weight measurements were retrieved retrospectively along with the final ROP outcomes and plotted on the online WINROP software. RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of WINROP were 85.7%, 59.0%, 6.98%, and 99.1% respectively for a cohort of 221 preterm infants (Median birth weight, 1040 g; Gestational age, 27.9 weeks). WINROP alarm was signaled in 42.6% of all infants. WINROP did not signal an alarm in one infant who needed treatment. This infant had intra ventricular hemorrhage grade 3-4 and temporary ventricular dilatation. CONCLUSIONS This is the first Australian study validating WINROP model. Our findings suggest that it lacked sensitivity to be used alone. However, adjusting the algorithm for the Australian population may improve the efficacy and reduce the number of examinations when used along with the current screening guidelines.","output":"Validation of WINROP (online prediction model) to identify severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in an Australian preterm population: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nephropathic subjects with impaired immune responses show dramatically high infection rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This work evaluated the ability to acquire and maintain protective antibodies over time in 26 hemodialysis patients and 21 kidney transplant recipients. The subjects were followed-up through quantitative determination of circulating SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in the 6-month period after clinical and laboratory recovery. A group of 143 healthcare workers with no underlying chronic pathologies or renal diseases recovered from COVID was also evaluated. In both dialysis and transplanted patients, antibody titers reached a zenith around the 3rd month, and then a decline occurred on average between the 270th and 300th day. Immunocompromised patients who lost antibodies around the 6th month were more common than non-renal subjects, although the difference was not significant (38.5% vs. 26.6%). Considering the decay of antibody levels below the positivity threshold (15 AU/mL) as failure, a progressive loss of immunisation was found in the overall population starting 6 months after recovery. A longer overall antibody persistence was observed in severe forms of COVID-19 (p = 0.0183), but within each group, given the small number of patients, the difference was not significant (dialysis: p = 0.0702; transplant: p = 0.1899). These data suggest that immunocompromised renal patients recovered from COVID-19 have weakened and heterogeneous humoral responses that tend to decay over time.

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19.

However, not all viruses affect patients in the same manner and extent. The pandemic of the SARS CoV-2 virus has brought interest to study the association of this novel virus on patients with mild-moderate and severe asthma in terms of susceptibility, severity and treatment. DATA SOURCES - STUDY SELECTION: We performed an extensive search of current literature in the databases PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar for original articles. We decided to include all types of articles, except for case studies, published until the end of February 2021 focusing on the effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system and the main treatment recommendations up to date for patients with bronchial asthma. RESULTS: Until now there is no clear evidence that asthmatics have a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations when infected, nor higher mortality rates than the general population. Nevertheless, our knowledge on molecular pathways behind asthma phenotypes in the past decades is growing, and it underlines the need to predict the unique response each patient may have to infection from the novel coronavirus. It is not clear yet if certain sub-populations of asthmatics are at higher risk than others. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of evidence for higher susceptibility and/or mortality in relation to COVID-19, all asthmatic patients, whether treated with inhaled bronchodilators/corticosteroids or even biologics, should maintain their controller therapy without making any alterations.","output":"Asthma in the era of SARS CoV-2 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) is the first and only nationally representative study on late-life cognition and dementia in India (n=4096). LASI-DAD obtained clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia for a subsample of 2528 respondents. OBJECTIVE: This study develops a machine learning model that uses data from the clinical consensus diagnosis in LASI-DAD to support the classification of dementia status. METHODS: Clinicians were presented with the extensive data collected from LASI-DAD, including sociodemographic information and health history of respondents, results from the screening tests of cognitive status, and information obtained from informant interviews. Based on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and using an online platform, clinicians individually evaluated each case and then reached a consensus diagnosis. A 2-step procedure was implemented to train several candidate machine learning models, which were evaluated using a separate test set for predictive accuracy measurement, including the area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and kappa statistic. The ultimate model was selected based on overall agreement as measured by kappa. We further examined the overall accuracy and agreement with the final consensus diagnoses between the selected machine learning model and individual clinicians who participated in the clinical consensus diagnostic process. Finally, we applied the selected model to a subgroup of LASI-DAD participants for whom the clinical consensus diagnosis was not obtained to predict their dementia status. RESULTS: Among the 2528 individuals who received clinical consensus diagnosis, 192 (6.7% after adjusting for sampling weight) were diagnosed with dementia. All candidate machine learning models achieved outstanding discriminative ability, as indicated by AUROC >.90, and had similar accuracy and specificity (both around 0.95). The support vector machine model outperformed other models with the highest sensitivity (0.81), F1 score (0.72), and kappa (.70, indicating substantial agreement) and the second highest precision (0.65). As a result, the support vector machine was selected as the ultimate model. Further examination revealed that overall accuracy and agreement were similar between the selected model and individual clinicians. Application of the prediction model on 1568 individuals without clinical consensus diagnosis classified 127 individuals as living with dementia. After applying sampling weight, we can estimate the prevalence of dementia in the population as 7.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The selected machine learning model has outstanding discriminative ability and substantial agreement with a clinical consensus diagnosis of dementia. The model can serve as a computer model of the clinical knowledge and experience encoded in the clinical consensus diagnostic process and has many potential applications, including predicting missed dementia diagnoses and serving as a clinical decision support tool or virtual rater to assist diagnosis of dementia.","output":"Learning From Clinical Consensus Diagnosis in India to Facilitate Automatic Classification of Dementia: Machine Learning Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fatty liver disease (FLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide.

METHODS: We developed an online cross-sectional survey, Habit Tracker (HabiT), completed by 1,344 adults (18 years). HabiT was released internationally with individuals from 80 countries participating; a majority residing in the United States and United Kingdom. We measured changes in OG (IGDS9-SF) and PV (CYPAT) behaviors before and during the COVID-19 quarantine period.

The estimated overall weighted CD prevalence was 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-5.9, I 2, 67.4%). The weighted serology-based CD prevalence in patients with TS (3.4%, 95% CI, 1.0-6.6) was similar to the weighted biopsy-based CD prevalence (4.8%; 95% CI, 3.4-6.5). The strength of association between TS and CD was estimated in only four studies (odds ratio 18.1, 95% CI, 1.82-180; odds ratio 4.34, 95% CI, 1.48-12.75; rate ratio 14, 95% CI, 1.48-12.75; rate ratio 42.5, 95% CI, 12.4-144.8). Given the lack of uniformity in the type of reported measures of association and study design, producing a weighted effect measure to evaluate the strength of association between TS and CD was unfeasible. Conclusion: Nearly 1 in every 22 patients with TS had CD. Regular screening for CD in patients with TS might facilitate early diagnosis and therapeutic management to prevent adverse effects of CD such as being underweight and osteoporosis.","output":"Prevalence of Celiac Disease in Patients With Turner Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In March 2020, Australian state and federal governments introduced physical distancing measures alongside widespread testing to combat COVID-19. These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behaviour of gay and bisexual men (GBM) in Australia. METHODS Between April 4 and April 29 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19, and whether they engaged in sexual behaviour with regular or casual partners or 'fuckbuddies' in the six months prior to becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'before COVID-19'), and following the date they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'since COVID-19'). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS Mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the six months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION GBM in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioural changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken prior to resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.","output":"Physical distancing due to COVID-19 disrupts sexual behaviours among gay and bisexual men in Australia: Implications for trends in HIV and other sexually transmissible infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinovirus and influenza virus infections of the upper airway lead to colds and the flu and can trigger exacerbations of lower airway diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets are still needed to differentiate between the cold and the flu, since the clinical course of influenza can be severe while that of rhinovirus is usually more mild. In our investigation of influenza and rhinovirus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, we used a systems approach to identify the temporally changing patterns of host gene expression from these viruses. After infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) with rhinovirus, influenza virus or co-infection with both viruses, we studied the time-course of host gene expression changes over three days.

We conducted a time-series analysis to evaluate the association of six common air pollutants with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children aged 0-14 years in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan and Xining), China during 2013-2018. We used generalized additive models incorporating penalized smoothing splines and random-effect meta-analysis to calculate city-specific and pooled estimates, respectively. The exposure-response relationship curves were fitted using the cubic spline regression. Subgroup analyses by gender, age, season and disease subtype were also performed. A total of 183,036 respiratory diseases hospitalizations were recorded during the study period, and 94.1% of the cases were acute respiratory infections. Overall, we observed that increased levels of air pollutants except O3, were significantly associated with increased hospital admissions for respiratory disease. Each 10 g/m3 increase in PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 at lag 07, PM10 at lag 03 and per 1 mg/m3 increase in CO at lag 01 corresponded to increments of 1.19%, 3.58%, 2.23%, 0.51% and 6.10% in total hospitalizations, respectively. Generally, exposure-response relationships of PM2.5 and SO2 in Guangzhou, SO2, NO2 and CO in Wuhan, as well as SO2 and NO2 in Xining with respiratory disease hospitalizations were also found. Moreover, the adverse effects of these pollutants apart from PM2.5 in certain cities remained significant even at exposure levels below the current Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) Grade II. Children aged 4-14 years appeared to be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5, SO2 and NO2. Furthermore, with the exception of O3, the associations were stronger in cold season than in warm season. Short-term exposure to PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and CO were associated, in dose-responsive manners, with increased risks of hospitalizations for childhood respiratory diseases, and adverse effects of air pollutants except PM2.5 held even at exposure levels below the current CAAQS Grade II in certain cities.","output":"Short term effects of air pollutants on hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children: A multi-city time-series study in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza vaccine effectiveness against influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) was assessed by test-negative design using historic datasets of the community-based Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN), spanning 2010-11 to 2016-17.

In the long run, rising inequality worldwide makes taxation of high-incomes indispensable for sustainable economic development. This paper empirically studies public attitudes on taxation related to income, preferences for solidarity vs. individual performance, and reliance on the state in the Czech Republic. In this Eastern European country, the dichotomies above bear even more importance due to the communist past. We apply the hierarchical regression analysis with smoothing spline transformations to a representative sample of public opinion data (N = 1104, aged 15C95 years, M  SD: 47.74  17.39;51.2% women, 18.50% with higher education). The results suggest that income was associated with the perception that taxes for the rich are inadequately high but was unrelated to perceptions of tax adequacy for average and poor groups of respondents. Higher solidarity and reliance on the state were associated with the desire to increase taxation of high-incomes and decrease taxation of poor income groups. Surprisingly, the reliance on the state was associated with a desire to decrease taxation of average-incomes and total taxation while increasing tax progressivity. Preferences for solidarity were associated with higher preferred overall taxation and more tax progressivity. The explanatory powers of preferences for solidarity and reliance on the state in explaining the variation in tax preferences are at least equivalent and, in some cases, twice as large as the explanatory power of the age, gender, education, and income altogether. The results above present new mechanisms that can contribute to sustainable endogenous economic development.","output":"The Effects of Solidarity, Income, and Reliance on the State on Personal Income Tax Preferences.

The core of the designed decision model is the forecasting model that attempts to ex-ante predict the cumulative flock mortality for the period between 8 and 28 d of age. Forecasts were generated with the parameters of the linear regression model where continuous values of daily mortalities served as a dependent variable. The decision variable is a binary (yes/no) choice variable, where yes means go ahead with treatment and no means do nothing. If the predicted cumulative mortality for the period between 8 and 28 d of age exceeds 9% of the total initial placement, the model generates a yes signal. If the predicted cumulative mortality for the same period is below 9% of the total initial placement, the model generates a no signal. The results indicate a reasonable accuracy of the prediction model where the number of correct prediction increases and the number of incorrect predictions falls very fast as the forecasting window shortens.

The EASy exam is a subcostal four-chamber view (SC4C), followed by inferior vena cava (IVC) and upper lung field views performed in quick succession. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of single-day EASy training on management prior to induction and intubation. METHODS: EASy training consists of a combination of a web-based curriculum, live lecture, and 10 exams performed under direct supervision. The EASy protocol was performed before emergency intubation on five critically ill patients. In this case series, we describe findings and management based on the EASy phenotypes (pattern recognition). RESULTS: Five resident-obtained EASy studies were performed in the ICU for emergency intubation. Two patients had COVID-19. Three had hyperdynamic ventricles with a small left ventricular (LV) cavity size with a < 1.5cm fully collapsible IVC consistent with hypovolemia (two of which had thickened LV walls indicating likely diastolic dysfunction). These three patients received a 10 mL/kg IV fluid bolus to counteract vasodilation and decreased venous return, and were started on phenylephrine. The fourth had normal contractility and diastolic cavity size with a normal-sized collapsible IVC. The fifth patient had biventricular dilation with reduced systolic function and a plethoric IVC. For this patient, no fluid bolus was given, and a vasopressor with inotropic properties (norepinephrine) was started. Etomidate was used for induction and intubation. The mean time for completion was 3 minutes (range 2 to 4 minutes). Three studies were deemed good quality and two were deemed adequate by an attending physician proficient in critical care ultrasound. Vitals were monitored for 15 minutes post-intubation, and all patients maintained hemodynamic stability with MAP  65 mmHg.

However, records show that this face-to-face program is underutilized and reaches only a minority of those that would benefit from it. The first-line OA management program has been transformed into a digital version, Joint Academy? (JA), to facilitate implementation, scaling, increased accessibility, and improved patient adherence. The smartphone application consists of video instructions distributed daily with individualized exercises for participants with knee or hip OA, as well as educational information on OA symptoms and self-management based on current international guidelines for the management of OA. Each participant is assigned to a physical therapist available through asynchronous chat and telephone who supervises the participant throughout the whole program. To improve chronically ill patients' health and quality of life, long-standing and continuous treatment is needed at an acceptable cost. Recent evidence suggests that JA costs 25% compared to the BOA program for three months of treatment. Providing patients with equal access to care necessitates availability in urban and rural areas alike. This can potentially be achieved by digital delivery, but it is yet unknown if digital delivery of first-line OA treatment, compared with face-to-face, improves equal access to care. The purpose of this study was to compare utilization of digital and face-to-face delivered OA treatment in the 21 different county councils of Sweden that are responsible for providing healthcare to the residents. Methods: Registered patient participation in the BOA program during 2019 and 2020 was retrieved from the BOA annual reports and live statistics from the BOA website (for 2020, unknown final data retrieval data). Data from digital program participation was retrieved from the JA database (for 2020 until Nov 18th). To be included, a patient needed to have registered for the first visit in the BOA registry or have enrolled in the program by answering the first questionnaire in the JA registry. Population density per county and county size were retrieved from Statistics Sweden. Results were calculated and presented as users per 100 000 residents. Mean and median values as well as standard deviations were calculated separately for registered participants/100 000 for BOA and JA programs, and for regions with more (n=12) or less (n=8) than 20 residents per km2. Results: In total 25652 patients from the BOA registry and 12240 patients from the JA database were included. The differences between individual county councils in the number of registered program participants per 100 000 residents varied far more for the face-to-face BOA program than for the digital JA program (Table 1). This is illustrated by the ratio between the highest and lowest participation numbers/100 000 being 13.6 for BOA and 2.6 for JA, and standard deviations of 162 and 27, respectively. The variability between county councils was greater for remote regions of the country with a population density below 20 per km2, than for more densely populated regions.

Thanks to the different existing techniques in natural language processing, it is possible to generate predictive models that automatically classify texts into different categories. However, a weakness has been detected concerning the language used to train such models. This work aimed to develop a predictive model based on BERT, capable of detecting racist and xenophobic messages in tweets written in Spanish. A comparison was made with different Deep Learning models. A total of five predictive models were developed, two based on BERT and three using other deep learning techniques, CNN, LSTM and a model combining CNN + LSTM techniques. After exhaustively analyzing the results obtained by the different models, it was found that the one that got the best metrics was BETO, a BERT-based model trained only with texts written in Spanish. The results of our study show that the BETO model achieves a precision of 85.22% compared to the 82.00% precision of the mBERT model. The rest of the models obtained between 79.34% and 80.48% precision.

Due to local standards, the surgical sponge colours can vary (e.g. white in US, green in Germany). The influence of sponge colour on accuracy of estimation has not been in the focus of research yet. MATERIAL AND METHODS A blood loss simulation study containing four \\"bleeding\\" scenarios each per sponge colour were created by using expired whole blood donation samples. The blood donations were applied to white and green surgical sponges after dilution with full electrolyte solution. Study participants had to estimate the absorbed blood loss in sponges in all scenarios. The difference to the reference blood loss was analysed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate other influence factors such as staff experience and sponge colour. RESULTS A total of 53 anaesthesists participated in the study. Visual estimation correlated moderately with reference blood loss in white (Spearman's rho: 0.521; p = 3.748*10-16) and green sponges (Spearman's rho: 0.452; p = 4.683*10-12). The median visually estimated blood loss was higher in white sponges (250ml IRQ 150-412.5ml) than in green sponges (150ml IQR 100-300ml), compared to reference blood loss (103ml IQR 86-162.8). For both colour types of sponges, major under- and overestimation was observed. The multivariate statistics demonstrates that fabric colours have a significant influence on estimation (p = 3.04*10-10), as well as clinician's qualification level (p = 2.20*10-10, p = 1.54*10-08) and amount of RBL to be estimated (p < 2*10-16). CONCLUSION The deviation of correct blood loss estimation was smaller with white surgical sponges compared to green sponges. In general, deviations were so severe for both types of sponges, that it appears to be advisable to refrain from visually estimating blood loss whenever possible and instead to use other techniques such as e.g. colorimetric estimation.","output":"Do we visually estimate intra-operative blood loss better with white or green sponges and is the deviation from the real blood loss clinically acceptable?

OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes of interest were incidence of COVID-19 per million population, case fatality ratio (CFR), deaths per million, and the effective reproduction number (R(t)). We also analysed the surveillance, testing, contact tracing and isolation indicators. RESULTS: Of the 192 450 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Chennai from 17 March to 31 October 2020, 114 889 (60%) were males.

Setting Academic long-term chronic care facility (Boston, MA) Participants Long-term care residents Methods Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were obtained via electronic medical records and Minimum Data Set. Staff residence was inferred by zip codes. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using nasopharyngeal swabs. Residents were followed until discharge from facility, death, or up to 21 days. Risk of COVID-19 infection were modeled by generalized estimating equation to estimate the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals of patient characteristics and staff community of residence. Results Overall 146 of 389 (37.5%) long-stay residents tested positive for COVID-19. At the time of positive test, 66 of 146 (45.5%) residents were asymptomatic. In the subsequent illness course the most common symptom was anorexia (70.8%), followed by delirium (57.6%). During follow-up 44 (30.1%) of residents with COVID-19 died. Mortality increased with frailty (16.7% in pre-frail, 22.2% in moderately frail, and 50.0% in frail; p<0.001). The proportion of residents infected with COVID-19 varied across the long-term care units (range: 0-90.5%). In adjusted models male sex (RR: 1.80, 95% CI, 1.07, 3.05), bowel incontinence (RR: 1.97, 95% CI 1.10, 3.52), and staff residence remained significant predictors of COVID-19. For every 10% increase in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive increased by 6% (95% CI, 1.04, 1.08). Conclusions and Implications Among long-term care residents diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Predictors of COVID-19 infection included male sex, bowel incontinence and staff residence in a community with a high burden of COVID-19. Universal testing of patients and staff in communities with high COVID-19 rates is essential to mitigating outbreaks.","output":"Risk Factors, Presentation, and Course of COVID-19 in a Large, Academic Long-term Care Facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Temporal resolution of cellular features associated with a severe COVID-19 disease trajectory is required for understanding skewed immune responses and finding outcome predictors.

Validation was performed in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 was characterized by an increase of proliferating, metabolically hyperactive plasmablasts. Coinciding with critical illness, we also identified an expansion of IFN-activated circulating megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis with features of hypoxic signalling. Megakaryocyte- and erythroid cell-derived co-expression modules were predictive of fatal disease outcome. The study demonstrates broad cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond classical immune cells and may serve as an entry point to develop biomarkers and targeted treatments of patients with COVID-19.","output":"Longitudinal multi-omics analyses identify responses of megakaryocytes, erythroid cells and plasmablasts as hallmarks of severe COVID-19 trajectories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevant personal protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic include face masks, possibly decreasing the risk of infection among the general population and healthcare workers (HCW) if utilized properly. The aim of the study was to assess whether different Polish HCW utilize face masks according to the 2020 World Health Organization guidance (WHO) criteria. This cross-sectional study included 1156 respondents who participated in an internet survey evaluating mask-related behaviors. All the WHO criteria were complied with by 1.4% of participants, regardless of medical profession, specialty or place of employment. HCW mostly adhered to criterion 1 (C1; strict covering of the face and mouth with the mask; 90.8%), C4 (washing/disinfecting the hands after touching/taking off the mask; 49%) and C3 (taking off the mask properly without touching the anterior surface; 43.4%), whereas C2 (avoidance of touching the mask with hands) was complied with least commonly (6.8%). HCW with mask-induced itch (31.6%) complied to C2 less often (odds ratio 0.53; p = 0.01).

As in most countries of the world, in Brazil, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been catastrophic. The increasing of deaths and the decrease of available beds in the hospitals, especially in 2021, have disturbed the health authorities. Several studies have reported the fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers from infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used to track the virus spread in a population via Wastewater-based Epidemiology (WBE). In this study, samples of untreated wastewater were collected weekly between June 9th, 2020 and March 17th, 2021 (41 weeks) at five sampling sites in the ABC Region, S?o Paulo, Brazil. This long-term monitoring was performed to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in the sewerage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers were detected throughout the period. The viral RNA concentration ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 log 10 genome copies.L ? 1 , with peaks in the last weeks of monitoring. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater samples and the epidemiological/clinical data, with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks. The COVID-19 prevalence for each sampling site was estimated using the viral load observed in wastewater and other parameters, via Monte-Carlo simulation. The mean predicted prevalence ranged 0.05 to 0.38%, slightly higher than reported (0.016  0.005%) in the ABC Region for the same period. These results highlight the viability of the WBE approach for COVID-19 infection monitoring in the largest urban agglomeration in South America. Environmental surveillance can be especially useful for health agencies and public decision-makers in predicting SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as well as in local tracing of infection clusters.","output":"Long-Term Monitoring of SARS-COV-2 RNA in Wastewater in Brazil: A More Responsive and Economical Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the latest issues of Cell Host & Microbe and Cell, three articles describe new mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain that escape neutralizing responses.

As part of a research programme to identify the optimal transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) threshold that translates into significantly improved QOL, we conducted a pilot randomized study of two transfusion algorithms (liberal versus restrictive) to determine the feasibility of a larger study. This trial was aligned with the REDDS study (ISRCTN26088319, Stanworth et al., BJH 2019) and followed the same pre-defined statistical analysis plan. Methods The study was undertaken at 3 cancer centers (NCT02099669). We included patients with MDS, CMML, low blast AML (20-30%) or myeloproliferative neoplasms who were TD (> 1 RBC/8 weeks x 16 weeks). Patients on disease modifying therapy for > 6 months were permitted only if they had remained stably RBC-TD with a life expectancy of > 3 months. Central randomization was to one of two RBC transfusion strategies over a 12-week period: 1. Restrictive strategy to maintain Hb between 85 and 105g/L. To achieve this, 2 RBC units were transfused when Hb < 85 g/L 2. Liberal strategy to maintain Hb between 110 and 120 g/L. To achieve this, 2 RBC units were transfused when Hb < 105 g/L and 1 unit for Hb 105-110 g/L. The first 4 weeks were considered a run-in period to achieve the target Hb. The primary outcomes of this feasibility study were 1. The percentage compliance of Hb being within or above the target range of the assigned transfusion threshold (after the 4 week run-in). Feasibility was set at 70%. 2. Achievement of at least a 15 g/L difference between the mean pre-transfusion Hb of the liberal and restrictive strategy groups. Secondary outcomes included changes and differences in QOL scores, rates of transfusion reactions and alloimmunizations, overall blood utilization and visit numbers and impact on serum ferritin. The primary analysis was intention to treat. The study was closed early due to COVID-19, with 28 patients randomized of planned 30. Results 30 patients were enrolled over 5 years and 28 patients randomized (n=15, liberal;n=13 restrictive). Median age was 74 (range 58-84), 26/28 had MDS or CMML and there were no significant imbalances in baseline disease and patient characteristics although patients in the restrictive group tended to have lower risk disease (IPSS-R very low + low 69% versus 53% liberal). Compared with the restrictive arm, liberal arm patients had more complete blood counts, were transfused more RBC units (only during the 4-week run-in) and were transfused at shorter intervals (Table 1). There were no differences in adverse events. Over the 12 weeks, the mean Hb value was 90  4 g/L (restrictive) versus 101  4 g/L (liberal), (p <0.0001, Figure 1). The pretransfusion difference was 11.8 g/L (95% CI 9.4-14.3) with mean pre-transfusion Hb values of 98.6 ( 10.6) g/L and 86.7 ( 8.6) in the liberal and restrictive arms respectively. Percentage compliance of pre-transfusion Hb falling within or above the target Hb range was 48% for restrictive patients but only 14% for liberal patients. Adherence with QOL completion (minimum of 4 serial) was 93%. While sample sizes are small and comparisons exploratory, the area under the curve for several serial quality of life scores was numerically higher and the curve more stable for the liberal arm (EQ5D (figure 2), EORTC cognitive and emotional functioning). Similarly, a higher % of patients in the liberal arm achieved pre-defined clinically meaningful increases in several symptom and function domains (emotional, social, fatigue, dyspnea, financial problems). Discussion Whilst our study results did not meet our feasibility endpoints, this small randomized trial in MDS patients demonstrated clinically important differences in mean Hb achievable with different transfusion thresholds. Poor rates of compliance with Hb targets were clearly identified for patients in the liberal arm, suggesting a need to understand the barriers to protocol adherence in this rm prior to embarking on larger trials. Compared with the REDDS trial, we did not document a significant excess of RBC transfusions needed (post run-in period) to maintain the higher Hb threshold. Similar to REDDS, we did observe some signals of improved QOL with a liberal transfusion strategy. A formal analysis of pooled results with REDDS study patients is planned.

We predict the spatiotemporal spread of reported COVID- 19 cases at the global level during the first few weeks of the current outbreak by analyzing openly available geolocated Twitter social media data. Human mobility patterns were estimated by analyzing geolocated 2013-2015 Twitter data from users who had: i) tweeted at least twice on consecutive days from Wuhan, China, between November 1, 2013, and January 28, 2014, and November 1, 2014, and January 28, 2015; and ii) left Wuhan following their second tweet during the time period under investigation. Publicly available COVID-19 case data were used to investigate the correlation among cases reported during the current outbreak, locations visited by the study cohort of Twitter users, and airports with scheduled flights from Wuhan. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) data were obtained to identify the capacity of countries receiving travellers from Wuhan to respond to COVID-19. Our study cohort comprised 161 users. Of these users, 133 (82.6%) posted tweets from 157 Chinese cities (1,344 tweets) during the 30 days after leaving Wuhan following their second tweet, with a median of 2 (IQR= 1-3) locations visited and a mean distance of 601 km (IQR= 295.2-834.7 km) traveled. Of our user cohort, 60 (37.2%) traveled abroad to 119 locations in 28 countries. Of the 82 COVID-19 cases reported outside China as of January 30, 2020, 54 cases had known geolocation coordinates and 74.1% (40 cases) were reported less than 15 km (median = 7.4 km, IQR= 2.9-285.5 km) from a location visited by at least one of our study cohort's users. Countries visited by the cohort's users and which have cases reported by January 30, 2020, had a median IDVI equal to 0.74. We show that social media data can be used to predict the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Based on our analyses, we anticipate cases to be reported in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia; additionally, countries with a moderate to low IDVI (i.e. &#8804;0.7) such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey should be on high alert and develop COVID- 19 response plans as soon as permitting.","output":"Use of Twitter social media activity as a proxy for human mobility to predict the spatiotemporal spread of COVID-19 at global scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The life cycle of Pleurogenoides wayanadensis Shinad & Prasadan, 2018, infecting the frogs Hoplobatrachus tigerinus and Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis, is elucidated in this study.

Here we investigated CD4+ T cells that are reactive against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthy donors. We detected spike-reactive CD4+ T cells not only in 83% of patients with COVID-19 but also in 35% of healthy donors. Spike-reactive CD4+ T cells in healthy donors were primarily active against C-terminal epitopes in the spike protein, which show a higher homology to spike glycoproteins of human endemic coronaviruses, compared with N-terminal epitopes. Spike-protein-reactive T cell lines generated from SARS-CoV-2-naive healthy donors responded similarly to the C-terminal region of the spike proteins of the human endemic coronaviruses 229E and OC43, as well as that of SARS-CoV-2. This results indicate that spike-protein cross-reactive T cells are present, which were probably generated during previous encounters with endemic coronaviruses.

We undertook in-depth qualitative interviews with ALS patients from a Veterans Administration hospital ALS multi-disciplinary clinic and explored their perspectives on issues of identity, privacy, enhancement, informed consent, and responsibility related to implantable BCI. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen (n = 16) individuals, and transcripts were analysed using a modified grounded theory approach. RESULTS Emergent themes included: (1) attitudes towards BCI were characterised by fear, hope, and hesitation about adoption of BCI technology; (2) analogies to other technologies were a useful tool in understanding and communicating opinions about ethical issues in BCI; (3) concerns about potentially socially stigmatising effects of BCI and the burden of adjustment to new therapeutic devices were important considerations to be weighed against the potential functional benefit of BCI use; (4) therapeutic decision-making in ALS often intimately involves loved ones; and (5) prospective decision-making about BCI was significantly affected by weighing the timing of the intervention with the progression of illness. CONCLUSION The interest in BCI and views on ethical issues raised by BCI is moderated by the experience of living with ALS. The findings from this study can help guide the development of implantable BCI technology for persons with ALS. Implications for rehabilitation Loved ones will play crucial roles in helping patients think through the possible benefits and burdens of getting a BCI device. Providers should consider how the ideal timing for getting an implantable BCI device will vary based on the priorities of persons with ALS and their disease stage. Concerns about social stigma, burden of adjustment, and the desire to maximise time left with loved ones may outweigh the potential functional benefits of BCI devices for some persons with ALS.","output":"\\"Re-identifying yourself\\": a qualitative study of veteran views on implantable BCI for mobility and communication in ALS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unmittelbar postnatal ist bei Frhgeborenen der rasche Beginn einer vollst?ndigen parenteralen Ern?hrung zur Fortsetzung des physiologischen intrauterinen umbilikalen N?hrstofftransports notwendig, da die Energiereserven gering sind, Katabolismus verhindert werden soll und die Entwicklung des Gehirns nicht beeintr?chtigt werden darf (Huppi 2008).

RESULTS: To answer the former question, we utilized 6 months of state employment level data from California, United States, as a method of gauging the economic health of agency-regulated industries. We implemented a machine learning model to predict weekly employment data and a t-test to indicate any significant changes in employment. We found that, following California's state-issued stay-at-home order and the agencys regulation suspension, oil and certain manufacturing industries had statistically significant lower employment values. To answer the latter question, we used 10 years of PM(2.5) levels in California, United States, as a metric for local air quality and treatmentCcontrol county pairs to isolate the impact of regulation rollbacks from the impacts of the state lockdown. Using the agencys data, we performed a t-test to determine whether treatmentCcontrol county pairs experienced a significant change in PM(2.5) levels. Even with the statewide lockdowna measure we hypothesized would correlate with decreased mobility and pollution levelsin place, counties with oil refineries experienced the same air pollution levels when compared to historical data averaged from the years 2009 to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the expectation that the suspension would improve the financial health of the oil and manufacturing industry, we can conclude that these industries are not witnessing economic growth with the suspension and state shutdown in place. Additionally, counties with oil refineries could be taking advantage of these rollbacks to continue emitting the same amount of PM(2.5), in spite of state lockdowns. For these reasons, we ask international policymakers to reconsider the suspension of enforcement regulations as these actions do not fulfill their initial expectations. We recommend the creation and maintenance of pollution control and prevention programs that develop emission baselines, mandate the construction of pollution databases, and update records of pollution emissions.

At a breathing flow rate of 30 L min-1, 17 out of 19 tested materials demonstrated collection efficiency below 50%; at 85 L min-1, only one material featured particle collection efficiency above 50%. Pressure drop values were mostly below 4 mm w.g. (observed in 89% of cases for the two flow rates), which provides comfortable breathing. Only for one fabric material (silk) tested at 85 L min-1 did the pressure drop reach 11 mm w.g. Based on these results, a three-layer facemask prototype was designed and fabricated comprised of the best performing materials. Additional tests were conducted to examine possible particle detachment/shedding from the materials used in the newly developed facemask, but no such phenomenon was observed. The prototype was evaluated on 10 human subjects using the standard OSHA-approved quantitative fit testing protocol. The mask protection level, determined as an adopted fit factor, was found to lie between that of the two commercial surgical/medical masks tested for comparison. A 10-cycle washing of the mask prototype lowered its collection efficiency across the particle size range; however, washing did not substantially affect mask breathability. The study revealed that although homemade masks offer a certain level of protection to a wearer, one should not expect them to provide the same respiratory protection as high-end commercial surgical/medical masks or-by any means-NIOSH-certified N95 filtering facepieces.","output":"Homemade facemasks: particle filtration, breathability, fit, and other performance characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reports on the first ICD-11 morbidity pilot for inpatient discharges in a public general hospital. We detail the pilot methodology, lessons learned in terms of facilitators and challenges, physician-reported opinion, and considerations for future implementation. The pilot included: engaging stakeholders; selecting the setting; building a common understanding of the discharge process; evaluating and preparing IT infrastructure; ICD-11 training; small-scale pre-pilot testing; implementing the pilot while providing on-site support and collecting data for analysis including a brief user-experience survey. Overall, physicians were satisfied with the experience. Facilitators for success included national health system influence, leadership commitment, a multidisciplinary team approach, physician-tailored training, using social media for training, and providing on-site support. Challenges included potential IT problems, and difficulties relating to training and engaging physicians. Issues to consider include DRG system requirements, and comparability of ICD-11 pilot results from different countries. In conclusion, ICD-11 can be successfully implemented for documenting diagnoses by physicians in a public hospital by installing the coding tool on the electronic hospital information system. Pilots can improve ICD-11 content by using the online proposal mechanism. Implementing ICD-11 requires effective change management, stakeholder-tailored communication, and innovative ideas for training to match the electronic nature of ICD-11 and its potential new users, physicians.","output":"ICD-11 Morbidity Pilot in Kuwait: Methodology and Lessons Learned for Future Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning January 2020, has already had an unprecedented impact on children, families, and schools around the world and in the U S The context and impact has varied considerably over time, including tremendous variation in schools providing education services in-person, via remote/distance learning, and various hybrid configurations involving both in-person and remote/distance learning configurations This special topic section of School Psychology Review aims to disseminate innovations and adaptations in research, training, and practice that help to inform and advance the field during the COVID-19 pandemic This introductory article offers a brief acknowledgement of the pervasive impact on communities around the world, provides a succinct synthesis of several recent research developments focused on key issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic and school psychology, as well as the pervasive impact on society, and then highlights the first three articles featured in this special topic section focused on adaptations and new directions for the field ? 2020 National Association of School Psychologists","output":"COVID-19 and School Psychology: Adaptations and New Directions for the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID\\\\19 is one of the most unpredictable global public health crises in recent times.

Some centers utilize a unique open ICU structure, where primary services longitudinally follow patients who become critically ill into the ICU with intensivist comanagement. The impact of open ICUs on patient care and education of trainees has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to characterize affordances and barriers to education and patient care, from the perspectives of hospitalists and intensivists teaching in the ICU. DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospitalist and intensivist faculty at a large academic medical center with an open ICU structure. We coded deidentified interview transcripts to inductively analyze the data for themes and subthemes. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited hospitalist and intensivist faculty members who attend on teaching services in the open ICU system. APPROACH: Given the complexity of multiple teachers and learners in the ICU environment, we selected shared mental models as our primary theoretical lens through which we analyzed and interpreted our data. KEY RESULTS: We identified three main themes regarding education in the open ICU system: (1) communication challenges, (2) educational barriers and affordances, and (3) structural barriers and affordances. Hospitalists and intensivists agreed on some barriers and facilitators to education, such as continuity of care, yet they disagreed on others. Specifically, hospitalists and intensivists had a shared mental model regarding barriers to patient care and education in the open ICU structure, but had divergent opinions regarding the affordances of the structure, such as continuity and availability of ICU expertise. CONCLUSIONS: The open ICU environment presents facilitators and barriers to trainee education and patient care. Our findings can be leveraged to improve communication, education, and patient care on both hospitalist and ICU teams.

This virus is closely related to coronaviruses infecting bats and Malayan pangolins, species suspected to be an intermediate host in the passage to humans. Several genomic mutations affecting viral proteins have been identified, contributing to the understanding of the recent animal-to-human transmission. However, the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to encode functional putative microRNAs (miRNAs) remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: We have used deep learning to discover 12 candidate stem-loop structures hidden in the viral protein-coding genome. Among the precursors, the expression of eight mature miRNAs-like sequences was confirmed in small RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 infected human cells. Predicted miRNAs are likely to target a subset of human genes of which 109 are transcriptionally deregulated upon infection. Remarkably, 28 of those genes potentially targeted by SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs are down-regulated in infected human cells. Interestingly, most of them have been related to respiratory diseases and viral infection, including several afflictions previously associated with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 pre-miRNA sequences with those from bat and pangolin coronaviruses suggests that single nucleotide mutations could have helped its progenitors jumping inter-species boundaries, allowing the gain of novel mature miRNAs targeting human mRNAs.

In this cross-sectional population-based study we used cumulative data on the first dose of vaccine received by 01-01-2022 at Middle Super Output Area level in England. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models and investigated if the geographical differences in vaccination uptake can be explained by a range of community-level characteristics covering socio-demographics, political view, COVID-19 health risk awareness and targeting of high risk groups and accessibility. Deprivation is the covariate most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (Odds Ratio 0.55, 95%CI 0.54C0.57; most versus least deprived areas).

Using normal human serum (NHS), heat-inactivated serum (HIS), human serum deficient of complement factor, respective reconstituted serum, assays like in vitro neutralization, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry-based tissue culture-based limited dose assay (TC-LDA) were carried out for assessing the activation of different complement pathways.

EGTA or EDTA pretreatment experiments indicated that CHPV neutralization proceeds through the alternative pathway of the complement activation. Our data showed a strong dependence on C3 for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. Disparity in CHPV neutralization levels between factor B-deficient and reconstituted sera could be attributed to amplification loop/tick-over mechanism. Assays using C3, C5, and C8 deficient sera indicated that complement-mediated CHPV neutralization and suppression of CHPV infectivity are primarily through C3 and C5, and not dependent on downstream complement factor C8.

Practice Nurses are well-positioned to provide comprehensive dementia information and support so that people living with dementia are better equipped to self-manage their health and live well with dementia. The purpose of this review was to systematically examine published literature to identify existing and potential roles of Practice Nurse's in the delivery of care to people affected by dementia and to describe the characteristics and effectiveness of nurse interventions in dementia models of care. METHODS: The PRISMA statement guided the systematic review of the quantitative and qualitative evidence for roles and characteristics of the Practice Nurse in the delivery of dementia care. A comprehensive literature search of seven electronic databases and Google scholar identified relevant original research published in English between January 2000 and January 2019. Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were extracted into the Covidence software for analysis. RESULTS: The heterogeneity of the included studies purpose, design and outcomes measures and the diversity in health systems and primary care nurses scope of practice made it difficult to synthesise the findings and draw conclusions. The heterogeneity did, however, provide important insights into the characteristics of roles undertaken by nurses working in the general practice setting, which were potentially beneficial to people living with dementia and their support person. These included patient accessibility to the Practice Nurse, early recognition and management of cognitive changes, care management and collaboration with the General Practitioner. Limitations of the provision of dementia care by Practice Nurses included a lack of definition of the role, inadequate dementia specific training, time constraints and poor communication with General Practitioners.

Here, a small-scale experiment was conducted to assess how nitrogen in the sediment-water interface (SWI) responds to HAB degradation and subsequent reoccurrence at different initial algal densities. The results showed that during the algae decomposition stage, the NH4 +-N flux of the SWI remained positive but decreased with the increase in algal density from 3.5  107 to 2.3  108 cells per L, indicating that the sediment was the source of NH4 +-N. In contrast, the deposit was a sink of NO3 --N. However, during the reoccurrence of HAB, the distribution of NH4 +-N and NO3 --N fluxes was completely converted. Nitrogen flux analysis throughout algae decomposition and reoccurrence indicated that although the sediment acted as a sink of nitrogen, the flux was dependent on the initial algal density. Our results confirmed that algae decomposition and reoccurrence would greatly affect the nitrogen cycle of the SWI, during which dissolved oxygen (DO) and initial algal density dominated.

By analogy with other viral proteins that induce cell fusion the MHV S protein would be expected to have a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that serves as a fusion peptide. Sequence analysis suggests that the S protein falls within the group of fusion proteins having internal rather than N-terminal fusion peptides. Based on the features of known viral fusion peptides, we identified two regions (PEP1 and PEP2) of MHV-A59 S2 as possible fusion peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis and anin vitrocell-to-cell fusion assay were used to evaluate the roles of PEP1 and PEP2, as well as a third previously identified putative fusion domain (PEP3) in membrane fusion. Substitution of bulky hydrophobic residues with charged residues within PEP1 affects the fusion activity of the S protein without affecting processing and surface expression. Similar substitutions within PEP2 result in a fusion-negative phenotype; however, these mutant S proteins also exhibit defects in protein processing and surface expression which likely explain the loss of the ability to induce fusion. Thus PEP1 remains a candidate fusion peptide, while PEP2 may play a significant role in the overall structure or oligomerization of the S protein. PEP3 is an unlikely putative fusion peptide since it is not conserved among coronaviruses and nonconservative amino acid substitutions in PEP3 have minimal effects on cell-to-cell fusion.","output":"Roles in Cell-to-Cell Fusion of Two Conserved Hydrophobic Regions in the Murine Coronavirus Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By weeks end the Democrat-led U S House of Representatives hopes to approve another massive coronavirus relief package For U S scientists, the good news is that the $3 trillion spending bill (H R 6800) unveiled last night contains billions of dollars in new research funding The bad news is that the bill is only a marker for negotiations with Senate Republicans and the White House on what more the federal government should do to help the country deal with the devastating economic and health effects of the pandemic","output":"House Democrats include research dollars in latest pandemic relief package"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recommendations in which the Mexican Society of Cardiology (SMC) in conjunction with the National Association of Cardiologists of Mexico (ANCAM) as well as different Mexican medical associations linked to cardiology are presented, after a comprehensive and consensual review and analysis of the topics related to cardiovascular diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients differed in ways that could reveal biases, e.g., age (8 vs. 80 years), kinship (stranger vs. cousin), gender (female vs. male), and villain/hero (shooter vs. policeman who stopped him).

In light of this and the COVID-19 pandemic we aimed to assess whether these patients could be safely assessed without direct contact between the clinician and patient. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of consecutive patients seen in our 'blurred disc clinic' between August 2018 and October 2019. We then presented anonymous information from their referral letter, their visual fields and optic nerve images to two consultant neuro-ophthalmologists blinded to the outcome of the face-to-face consultation. In the simulated virtual clinic, the two consultants were asked to choose an outcome for each patient from discharge, investigate or bring in for a face-to-face assessment. RESULTS: Out of 133 patients seen in the blurred disc clinic, six (4.5%) were found to have papilloedema. All six were identified by both neuro-ophthalmologists as needing a face-to-face clinic consultation from the simulated virtual clinic. One hundred and twenty (90%) patients were discharged from the face-to-face clinic at the first consultation. The two neuro-ophthalmologists chose to discharge 114 (95%) and 99 (83%) of these respectively from the simulated virtual clinic. The virtual clinic would have potentially missed serious pathology in only one patient who had normal optic discs but reported diplopia at the previous face-to-face consultation.

These studies have come from a range of locations, each with different underlying HIV prevalence and access to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Differences in healthcare quality, access and policies may also affect reported outcomes in PWH across different locations, making interpretation of results more challenging. Meanwhile, different components of ART have been proposed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or disease progression. SUMMARY: The current review considers 6 months of data across geographic regions with a range of healthcare quality and access and ART regimens to generate a wider view of COVID-19 outcomes in PWH. Taken together, these studies indicate that HIV infection may be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, but comorbidities appear to play a larger role than HIV-specific variables in outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH.

Disease progression is likely driven by a cytokine storm, either directly stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 or by increased systemic inflammation in which the gut might play an integral role. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the gut may cause increased intestinal permeability, alterations to the fecal microbiome, and increased inflammatory cytokines. Each effect may lead to increased systemic inflammation and the transport of cytokines and inflammatory antigens from the gut to the lung. Few interventions are being studied to treat people with mild disease and prevent the cytokine storm. Serumderived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) may prevent progression by (1) binding and neutralizing inflammatory antigens, (2) decreasing gut permeability, (3) interfering with ACE2 binding by viral proteins, and (4) improving the fecal microbiome.

Despite several studies, there is yet a dearth of data regarding the mechanisms of cardiac injury, clinical presentation, risk factors, and treatment of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at defining the clinical, electrocardiographic, and pathologic spectrum of cardiovascular disease (CVD), frequency of elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, and their frequency and relationship with severity of the disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients and to develop a triage risk stratification tool (TRST) that can serve as a guide for the timely recognition of the high-risk patients and mechanism-targeted therapy. We conducted an online search in databases of PubMed and Embase to identify relevant studies. Data selection was in concordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results were presented as pooled frequencies, odds ratio, standardized mean difference (SMD), and forest and funnel plots. RESULTS: We gathered a total of 54 studies and included 35 of them in our meta-analysis. Acute cardiac injury occurred in more than 25% of cases, mortality was 20 times higher, and admission to intensive care unit increased by 13.5 times. Hypertension was the most common pre-existing comorbidity with a frequency of 29.2%, followed by diabetes mellitus (13.5%). The deceased group of patients had higher cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, with statistically significant SMD, compared with survivors. Pediatric patients were predominantly mildly affected. However, less frequently, the presentation was very similar to Kawasaki disease or Kawasaki shock syndrome. This latter presentation hass been called as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide spectrum of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients, and hence a Triage Risk Stratification Tool can serve as a guide for the timely recognition of the high-risk patients and mechanism-targeted therapy.","output":"Cardiovascular disease in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10,898 patients and proposal of a triage risk stratification tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection first seen in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then affected the whole world by causing a pandemic.

Although the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been a great challenge for the diagnostic capacities, it also proved to be a unique source of experience. While previously PCR tests had overwhelmingly been used for targeted diagnostic and quantitative follow-up testing, screening and (initially) release tests became far more prevalent during the pandemic. It was well to be seen that the forced pace of bringing tests to market often gave way to not fully mature concepts. The PCR method is based on the detection of sequences, the proportions of which are likely to alter throughout the course of the disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that different target genes might be the best suitable for diagnostic, screening and release testing. Even with specific assays, an unprecedentedly high number of tests might result in the inflation of the positive predictive value, when the true prevalence of the infection remains very low among the tested individuals. Here we try to summarize some of the potentially most relevant diagnostic conclusions of the pandemic so far according to our own data and the literature.

Among the different fusion techniques, decision-level fusion has unique advantages to fuse the decisions of various classifiers and getting an effective outcome. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion method that combines three well-calibrated ensemble classifiers, namely, a random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) methods. It is used to predict the COVID-19 patient health for early monitoring and efficient treatment. A soft voting technique is used to generate the final decision result from the predictions of these calibrated classifiers. The method uses the COVID-19 patient's health information, travel demographic, and geographical data to predict the possible outcome of the COVID-19 case, recovered, or death. A different set of experiments is conducted on a public novel Corona Virus 2019 dataset using a different ratio of test sets. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion method achieved an accuracy of 97.24% and an F1-score of 0.97, which is higher than the current related work that has an accuracy of 94% and an F1-score 0.86, on 20% test set taken from the dataset.","output":"A Decision-Level Fusion Method for COVID-19 Patient Health Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, 290 Chinese native Yantai black pig piglets were investigated to identify gene polymorphisms, for haplotype reconstruction, and to determine the association between piglet diarrhea and swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class II DQA exons 2, 3, and 4 by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism and cloning sequencing.

Vaccination has proven to be the most effective technique, by far, for the treatment of COVID-19 and to combat the outbreak. Among all vaccine types, epitope-based peptide vaccines have received less attention and hold a large untapped potential for boosting vaccine safety and immunogenicity. Peptides used in such vaccine technology are chemically synthesized based on the amino acid sequences of antigenic proteins (T-cell epitopes) of the target pathogen. Using wet-lab experiments to identify antigenic proteins is very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. We hereby propose an ensemble machine learning (ML) model for the prediction of T-cell epitopes (also known as immune relevant determinants or antigenic determinants) against SARS-CoV-2, utilizing physicochemical properties of amino acids. To train the model, we retrieved the experimentally determined SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes from Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) repository. The model so developed achieved accuracy, AUC (Area under the ROC curve), Gini, specificity, sensitivity, F-score, and precision of 98.20%, 0.991, 0.994, 0.971, 0.982, 0.990, and 0.981, respectively, using a test set consisting of SARS-CoV-2 peptides (T-cell epitopes and non-epitopes) obtained from IEDB. The average accuracy of 97.98% was recorded in repeated 5-fold cross validation. Its comparison with 05 robust machine learning classifiers and existing T-cell epitope prediction techniques, such as NetMHC and CTLpred, suggest the proposed work as a better model. The predicted epitopes from the current model could possess a high probability to act as potential peptide vaccine candidates subjected to in vitro and in vivo scientific assessments.

Evaluate the relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis. AIM Youth at CHR for psychosis often demonstrate significant negative symptoms and poor functioning, though the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the two remains unknown. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in CHR samples. METHOD Electronic databases CINAHL, EBM, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched from inception. Studies were selected if they included any study that reported a relationship between negative symptoms and functioning in youth at clinical high risk (CHR). The correlation coefficient r was converted to Cohen's d, and all random-effects meta-analyses were performed using the transformed values. RESULTS Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 4574 individuals at CHR for psychosis. Negative symptom total scores were significantly associated with poorer global functioning (d, -1.40; 95% CI, -1.82 to -0.98; I = 79.4%; p < .001 [9 studies, n = 782]), social functioning (d, -1.10; 95% CI, -1.27 to -0.93; I = 10.40%; p < .001 [12 studies, n = 811]), and role functioning (d, -0.96; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.76; I = 41.1%; p < .001 [9 studies, n = 881]). In addition, negative symptoms were consistently associated with poor premorbid functioning. When examining negative symptom domains, avolition, anhedonia, and blunted affect were each significantly and independently associated with poorer social functioning and role functioning. In terms of prediction models, negative symptoms contributed to the prediction of lower functioning across multiple studies.

Other fields of research have developed approaches to solve this type of problem. Researchers measuring improvement in quality of life or clinical assessments have defined minimally important differences (MID) which are then used to define magnitudes when planning studies. Also, studies that measure cost effectiveness use benchmarks, such as cost/QALY, but do not provide benchmarks for cost differences. In a review of the literature, we found no publications identifying indicators of magnitude for costs. However, the literature describes three approaches used to identify minimally important outcome differences: (1) anchor-based, (2) distribution-based, and (3) a consensus-based Delphi methods. In this exploratory study, we used these three approaches to derive MID for two types of resource measures common in costing studies for: (1) hospital admissions (high cost); and (2) clinic visits (low cost). We used data from two (unpublished) studies to implement the MID estimation. Because the distributional characteristics of cost measures may require substantial samples, we performed power analyses on all our estimates to illustrate the effect that the definitions of small and large costs may be expected to have on power and sample size requirements for studies. The anchor-based method, while logical and simple to implement, may be of limited value in cases where it is difficult to identify appropriate anchors. We observed some commonalities and differences for the distribution and consensus-based approaches, which require further examination.

On 03/17/20, CMS expanded telehealth rules, allowing Medicare to cover telehealth visits like regular visits. This study aims to analyze the utilization of Evaluation & Management (E&M) telehealth options in community oncology pre and post pandemic. Methods: Deidentified patient visits data were obtained from iKnowMed electronic health records between 01/01/18 to 05/24/2021 from 20 US Oncology practices. A combination of patient MRN and date was used as an identifier to report number of visits for all measures. Patient visits with modifiers CGT, C95, and CGQ were classified as telehealth visits. Visit dates without modifiers were defined as non-telehealth (in-office) visits. E&M visits were defined based on standard CPT codes. Results: A total of 5,914,125 unique E&M patient visits were analyzed during the study period. Between Jan-2018 and Mar-2020 (pre-COVID-19), E&M visits rose from 30,000/week to 36,000/week (20%). Fewer than 0.01% of these visits were telehealth. By April 12, 2020, overall E&M visits had dropped 35%, but the telehealth visits had risen to 16%. Since then, the overall E&M visit count remained approximately 5% lower as compared to the pre-COVID-19 trend, and telehealth visits averaged approximately 6% thereafter. Corresponding to the 2nd wave, in Dec-2020 the telehealth proportion rose again to 10%. As of 05/23/2021, telehealth E&M visits represented approximately 5% of the total E&M visits within US Oncology practices.

However, many scientists disagree, and it is essential to understand that several factors and variables can cause a false-negative test. In this context, cycle threshold (Ct) values are being utilized to diagnose or predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. This practice has a significant clinical utility as Ct values can be correlated with the viral load. In addition, Ct values have a strong correlation with multiple haematological and biochemical markers. However, it is essential to consider that Ct values might be affected by pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytical variables such as collection technique, specimen type, sampling time, viral kinetics, transport and storage conditions, nucleic acid extraction, viral RNA load, primer designing, real-time PCR efficiency, and Ct value determination method. Therefore, understanding the interpretation of Ct values and other influential factors could play a crucial role in interpreting viral load and disease severity. In several clinical studies consisting of small or large sample sizes, several discrepancies exist regarding a significant positive correlation between the Ct value and disease severity in COVID-19. In this context, a revised review of the literature has been conducted to fill the knowledge gaps regarding the correlations between Ct values and severity/fatality rates of patients with COVID-19. Various databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched up to April 2021 by using keywords including RT-PCR or viral load, SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR, Ct value and viral load, Ct value or COVID-19. Research articles were extracted and selected independently by the authors and included in the present review based on their relevance to the study. The current narrative review explores the correlation of Ct values with mortality, disease progression, severity, and infectivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This assessment was divided into four sections: an institutional EHR readiness assessment, legal consultation, institutional review board application submission, and a test of healthcare data transmission over a blockchain infrastructure. RESULTS: All participating institutions reported the ability to electronically extract data from EHRs for research. Formal legal agreements were deemed unnecessary to the project but would be needed in future tests of real patient data exchange. Data transmission to the FDA blockchain met the success criteria of data connection from within the four institutions' firewalls, externally to the FDA blockchain via a SDB. DISCUSSION: The readiness survey indicated advanced analytic capability in hospital institutions and highlighted inconsistency in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format utilitzation across institutions, despite requirements of the 21st Century Cures Act. Further testing across more institutions and annual exercises leveraging the application of data exchange over a blockchain infrastructure are recommended actions for determining the feasibility of this approach during a public health emergency and broaden the understanding of technical requirements for multisite data extraction.

Radiologically, they present with varied findings which includes ground glass opacity, reticulations, honey combing, septal thickenings or the combination of these findings. Some specific combination could lead to the diagnosis of a particular ILD provided radiological findings match the clinical presentations. We present a patient who came with chronic cough and shortness of breath and CT chest showed anterior mediastinal mass with bilateral pulmonary nodules. Surgical lung biopsy revealed cellular NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia) and LIP (lymphoid interstitial pneumonia). Case: A 30-year-old female presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea for approximately 3 weeks that had worsened and was associated with decreased exercise tolerance. All routine laboratory workup was unremarkable. Inflammatory markers like CRP, ESR, LDH were slightly elevated. COVID-19 test was negative. A CT angiography of the thorax demonstrated an 8cm anterior right upper lobe pulmonary mass with numerous pulmonary nodules in bilateral lung fields. MRI of the brain, bone scan and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate any evidence of metastatic disease. A CT-guided core needle biopsy of the anterior lung mass was performed as well as several rheumatologic blood tests. Antinuclear antibody was positive with elevated RNP antibody 3.2 (reference &lt;1), elevated autoantibodies to SS-A/Ro 6.5 (reference &lt;1). The pathology of the core needle biopsy of the anterior lung mass was positive for thymoma. A video assisted thoracoscopic surgery of the lung was performed. The pathology of the pulmonary nodules was positive for overlapping features of cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia and LIP. The diagnoses of Sjogren's related interstitial lung disease and thymoma were made. She was treated with mycophenolate and prednisone. Discussion: NSIP is primarily idiopathic however it can be found in association with connective tissue disorders including Sjogren's disease, lupus, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis. CT findings for NSIP often show traction bronchiectasis with symmetric and bilateral ground-glass opacities with no honeycombing. This case above describes a patient with bilateral pulmonary nodules that were initially thought to be metastatic from her accompanying anterior chest wall mass. Although considered very rare, anterior chest wall masses that are associated with connective tissue diseases include thymoma, thymic cyst, teratoma, and thymic carcinoma.

Norovirus (NoV) and sapovirus (SaV) have been sporadically reported to cause chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. METHODS We undertook a retrospective study (2008-2009) to examine the clinical and epidemiologic significance of NoV and SaV infections in adult renal transplant recipients hospitalized for acute or chronic diarrhea. RESULTS Ninety-six renal transplant recipients were hospitalized for diarrhea at our institution during a 16-month period, 87 of whom were included in the study, including 46 patients with chronic diarrhea. Among 41 patients with unexplained diarrhea, 20 patients were screened for NoV/SaV, 16 of whom were positive. Fifteen of them (94%) had chronic diarrhea. When compared with bacterial and parasitic infections, NoV/SaV infections were associated with a greater weight loss at the time of admission, a 8.7-fold longer duration of symptoms and a more frequent need for mycophenolic acid dosage reduction. Eighty-one percent of patients hospitalized for NoV/SaV-associated diarrhea experienced acute renal failure. Five and one patients subsequently had biopsy-diagnosed active graft rejection and oxalate nephropathy, respectively. Ten of the 14 patients who underwent a longitudinal study of NoV/SaV stool's clearance exhibited a prolonged viral shedding period with a median time of 289 days (107-581 days).

However, information about the effect of cryopreservation on outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic donor grafts is limited. We evaluated outcomes of HCT recipients who received either fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 7397 patients were included in the analysis. Recipients of cryopreserved graft were divided into 3 cohorts based on graft source: HLA-matched related PBSC donors (n = 1051), matched unrelated PBSC donors (n = 678), and matched related or unrelated BM donors (n = 154). These patients were propensity score matched with 5514 patients who received fresh allografts. The primary endpoint was engraftment. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increased risk of delayed engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival with cryopreservation of BM grafts. In contrast, cryopreservation of related donor PBSC grafts was associated with decreased platelet recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.78; P < .001) and an increased risk of grade II-IV (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.48; P = .002) and grade III-IV (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.84; P < .001) acute graft-versus-host disease. Cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC grafts was associated with delayed engraftment of neutrophils (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and platelets (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.66; P < .001) as well as an increased risk of NRM (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.66; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58; P = .002) and decreased progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.58; P < .001). Reasons for cryopreservation were not routinely collected; however, in a subset of unrelated donor HCT recipients, the reason was typically a change in patient condition. Products cryopreserved for patient reasons were significantly associated with inferior OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; P = .029). We conclude that cryopreservation is associated with slower engraftment of PBSC grafts, which may be associated with inferior transplantation outcomes in some patient populations. However, the small numbers in the cryopreserved BM cohort and the lack of information on the reason for cryopreservation in all patients suggests that these data should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the context of the risks associated with unexpected loss of a graft during the pandemic.

Therefore, post-vaccination serological assessments are needed to evaluate the effect of the vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 antibody response.Methods: We designed a prospective multicenter cohort study enrolling pwMS who were scheduled for SARS-Cov-2 vaccination with mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech, Inc or mRNA-1273, Moderna Tx, Inc). A blood collection for the measure of SARS-CoV-2 antibody before the first vaccine dose and 4 weeks after the second dose was planned, with a centralized serological assessment (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics).Findings: 780 pwMS (76% BNT162b2 and 24% mRNA-1273) had pre- and 4-week post-vaccination blood assessments. 87 (112%) were untreated, 154 (197%) on ocrelizumab, 25 (32%) on rituximab, 85 (109%) on fingolimod, 25 (32%) on cladribine and 404 (517%) on other DMTs. 677 patients (868%) had detectable post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. At multivariate analysis, the antibody levels of patients on ocrelizumab (178-fold decrease, p<0001), fingolimod (26-fold decrease, p<0001) and rituximab (17-fold decrease, p<0001) were significantly reduced as compared to untreated patients. mRNA-1273 vaccine resulted in a systematically 35-fold higher antibody level than the BNT162b2 vaccine (p<0001).Interpretation: In pwMS, therapy with anti-CD20 and fingolimod led to a reduced humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Therefore, it has been recently proposed as a route of choice for glucocorticoids to control neuroinflammation processes in patients with severe Covid-19. However, appropriate delivery systems tailored to enhance their efficacy yet need to emerge. In this work we present the development of sprayable brain targeting powder delivery platform of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP). DSP-loaded microspheres, optimised employing Quality-by-Design approach, were blended with soluble inert carriers (mannitol or lactose monohydrate). Powder blends were characterized in terms of homogeneity, flow properties, sprayability, in vitro biocompatibility, permeability and mucoadhesion. Nasal deposition studies were performed using 3D printed nasal cavity model. Mannitol provided better powder blend flow properties compared to lactose. Microspheres blended with mannitol retained or enlarged their mucoadhesive properties and enhanced DSP permeability across epithelial model barrier. DSP dose fraction deposited in the olfactory region reached 17.0% revealing the potential of developed powder platform for targeted olfactory delivery. The observed impact of nasal cavity asymmetry highlighted the importance of individual approach when aiming olfactory region.","output":"A Dry Powder Platform for Nose-to-Brain Delivery of Dexamethasone: Formulation Development and Nasal Deposition Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although South Koreas response to COVID-19 has received international praise, the nations public health policy raises numerous privacy concerns, with a growing number of civil society groups joining the conversation Following changes to public health law in 2015 in response to the MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) crisis, South Koreas KCDC (Center for Disease Control) reconfigured its enforcement practice with measures tied to the movements of infected patients New laws allow for the use of information communications technology and personal data (cell phone, CCTV, credit card transactions) to track patients, thereby identifying the possible routes of transmission for disease Through mid-April 2020, this system received extensive praise, but more recently, with the Itaewon Cluster, centered in a popular nightclub district, citizens are starting to raise concerns Itaewon is associated with prostitution due to its legacy of proximity to an American military base, and by extension, the presence of foreigners in general, including LGBT clubs While contact tracing promises to preserve the anonymity of data, the significant rise in case numbers since May 2020 has resulted in calls for targeting these groupsforeigners, LGBT, English teacherssuggesting that xenophobia and social stigma continue to represent powerful forces","output":"Contact Tracing and COVID-19: The South Korean Context for Public Health Enforcement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a review of flame retardants used for glass/polyester laminates.

BACKGROUND: With the surge in COVID-19 cases requiring ICU care, non-ICU nurses maybe deployed into the ICUs. Having experienced through SARS, hospitals in Singapore instituted upskilling programs to secure general ward nurses' competency in providing critical care nursing. However, no studies have explored the perceptions of general ward nurses on deployment into the ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: The study was conducted at Singapore's epicentre of COVID-19 management. Five focus groups were conducted following purposive sampling of 30 general ward nurses identified for outbreak ICU deployment. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and data thematically analysed. This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Three salient themes arose, exemplifying the transition from clinical experts in the general wards to practising novices in the outbreak ICUs. Firstly, 'Into the deep end of the pool' described general ward nurses' feelings of anxiety and stress associated with higher exposure risk and expanded responsibilities to nurse critically ill patients. Secondly, 'Preparing for \\"war\\"' illustrated deployed nurses' need for clear communication and essential critical care nursing training. Lastly, 'Call of duty' affirmed the nurses' personal and professional commitment to embrace this transition into the ICUs, and their desire for greater psychosocial support. CONCLUSION: The study findings highlight that though general ward nurses perceived their impending ICU deployment positively, they require ongoing support to facilitate a smoother transition. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings provided an evidence base to improve the preparedness of general ward nurses deployed into the ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic within key areas of training, information dissemination and psychosocial resilience.","output":"'From Expert to Novice', Perceptions of General Ward Nurses on Deployment to Outbreak Intensive Care Units during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has emerged as a highly transmissible disease which has caused a disastrous impact worldwide by adversely affecting the global economy, health, and human lives. This sudden explosion and uncontrolled worldwide spread of COVID\\\\19 has revealed the limitations of existing healthcare systems regarding handling public health emergencies.

Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. METHODS: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1C4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1C4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.","output":"A review of the safety of favipiravir C a potential treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lung ultrasound (LUS) can be an important imaging tool for the diagnosis and assessment of lung involvement.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate internet search behaviors related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms-Google and Instagram-during the current global pandemic. METHODS: We have defined infodemic moniker as a term, query, hashtag, or phrase that generates or feeds fake news, misinterpretations, or discriminatory phenomena. Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, we explored internet search activities and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 6, 2020. We investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak volume with a 95% CI for the monikers. RESULTS: The top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were \\"coronavirus,\\" \\"corona,\\" \\"COVID,\\" \\"virus,\\" \\"corona virus,\\" and \\"COVID-19.\\" Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google.

Over the past 50 years, the electrolyte leakage method has emerged as a popular and practical method for quantifying the amount of damage inflicted on plant tissue by exposure to freezing temperatures. Numerous approaches for carrying out this method and analyzing the resultant data have emerged. These include multiple systems for standardizing and modeling raw electrolyte leakage data and multiple protocols for boiling or autoclaving samples in order to maximize leakage as a positive control. We compare four different routines for standardization of leakage data and assess a novel control methodimmersion in liquid nitrogen in lieu of traditional autoclavingand apply them to woody twigs collected from 12 maple (Acer) species in early spring. We compare leakage data from these samples using each of four previously published forms of data analysis and autoclaving vs. liquid nitrogen controls and validate each of these approaches against visual estimates of freezing damage and differential thermal analysis. RESULTS: Through presentation of our own data and re-analysis of previously published findings, we show that standardization of raw data against estimates of both minimum and maximum attainable freezing damage allows for reliable estimation of cold hardiness at the species level and across studies in diverse systems. Furthermore, use of our novel liquid nitrogen control produces data commensurate across studies and enhances the consistency and realism of the electrolyte leakage method, especially for very cold hardy samples. CONCLUSION: Future leakage studies that relativize data against minimum and maximum leakage and that employ our updated liquid nitrogen control will contribute generalizable, repeatable, and realistic data to the existing body of cold hardiness research in woody plants. Data from studies conducted using a liquid nitrogen (and not an autoclaving) control can still be compared to previously published data, especially when raw data are standardized using the best-performing approach among those we assessed. Electrolyte leakage of woody twigs emerges as a useful technique for quickly assessing the probability of tissue death in response to freezing in dormant plants. Differential thermal analysis may provide different and complementary information on cold hardiness.

It is both a result of natural ecological system development, and also an inevitable outcome of human ecological system development within a certain stage, with the objective of identifying the possible improvement space for unban ecological security evaluation from complex system perspective. Based on the brittle structure model and set pair theory, this paper firstly explored the main research methods of urban ecological security theory and its characteristics, then conducted a theory of complex system brittleness to analyze the urban ecological security brittle factors, brittle primitives, and brittle structure. Furthermore, it conducted a model of urban ecological system brittleness correlation entropy together with a set pair analysis method to discuss its brittleness. And finally, an ecological safety evaluation has been presented based on the empirical case in Chengdu City of China. The theoretical and empirical analysis shows that the brittle correlation entropy of natural subsystem in urban ecological security is the biggest one. The risks from natural subsystem collapse can easily trigger the brittleness of the entire urban system. The corresponding maximum brittle fluctuation entropy is from economic subsystem; it has a largest impact on the entropy change of urban ecosystem. The way of reducing the uncertainty of urban ecological risks is to lower difference degree coefficient in the system. Relevant decision makers should consider to reduce the increasing degree of entropy and eliminate the fluctuation of the brittle factors. Thus, the threats or risks of urban ecological system can be within the acceptable range and under control.

Importantly, we identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vaccinated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. DESIGN: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. MEASURES: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing; personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes on the molecular epidemiology of herpangina children during 2019-2020 in Tongzhou district, Beijing, China. METHOD: From January 2019 to December 2020, children diagnosed with herpangina were recruited by the staff from Tongzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Beijing. Viral RNA extraction from pharyngeal swabs was used for enterovirus (EV) detection and the complete VP1 gene was sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis was performed based on all VP1 sequences for EV genotypes. RESULT: A total of 1,331 herpangina children were identified during 2019-2020 with 1,121 in 2019 and 210 in 2020, respectively. The predominant epidemic peak of herpangina children was in summer and autumn of 2019, but not observed in 2020. Compared to the number of herpangina children reported in 2019, it decreased sharply in 2020. Among 129 samples tested in 2019, 61 (47.3%) children were detected with EV, while 22.5% (20/89) were positive in 2020. The positive rate for EV increased since June 2019, peaked at August 2019, and decreased continuously until February 2020. No cases were observed from February to July in 2020, and the positive rate of EV rebounded to previous level since August 2020. Four genotypes, including coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6, 9.3%), CV-A4 (7.8%), CV-A10 (2.3%) and CV-A16 (10.1%), were identified in 2019, and only three genotypes, including CV-A6 (9.0%), CV-A10 (6.7%) and CV-A16 (1.1%), were identified in 2020. The phylogenetic analysis showed that all CV-A6 strains from Tongzhou located in Group C, and the predominant strains mainly located in C2-C4 subgroups during 2016-2018 and changed into C1 subgroup during 2018-2020. CV-A16 strains mainly located in Group B, which consisting of strains widely distributed around the world. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant genotypes gradually shifted from CV-A16, CV-A4 and CV-A6 in 2019 to CV-A6 in 2020 under COVID-19 pandemic. Genotype-based surveillance will provide robust evidence and facilitate the development of public health measures.","output":"Molecular Epidemiology of Herpangina Children in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China, During 2019-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolution of Healthy People reflects growing awareness of health inequities over the life course.

The bound position of the terminal sialic acid (NeuAc) is the same in all five complexes and is identical to that reported previously from the study of mono- and trisaccharides. The two oligosaccharides with NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal linkages and GlcNAc at the third position have a folded conformation with the GlcNAc doubled back to contact the sialic acid.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-) release assays, such as the QuantiFERON-TB? Gold Plus test (QFT-Plus), are now widely implemented for the in vitro diagnosis of LTBI. To date, the detection and quantification of IFN- has been mostly performed with semi-automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), but several limitations currently exist. The study aims to evaluate the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer LIAISON? XL in comparison to ELISA for the performance of the QFT-Plus test. Between February and April 2020, 333 heparin blood samples from 323 adult patients were collected at a tertiary teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Overall, the CLIA analyzer LIAISON? XL performed well for the detection of IFN- compared to the ELISA method, demonstrating substantial agreement (, 0.872) and great correlation between assays (r, >0.950). CLIA produced significantly higher values of IFN- IU/mL than the ELISA (p=0.004 for TB1 tube, and p=0.010 for TB2 tube). Many discrepant cases (8/15, 53.3%) corresponded to indeterminate results with ELISA (NIL-corrected mitogen value <0.5 IU/mL), which analyzed with the CLIA analyzer LIAISON? XL reverted to interpretable results. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that CLIA may potentially present a greater sensitivity for the identification of LTBI, especially among immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, the analytical variability reported between both ELISA and CLIA methods, especially around the standardized 0.35 IU/mL positivity threshold, suggests the need to refine the interpretative algorithm.","output":"Evaluation of the Fully-Automated Chemiluminescence Analyzer LIAISON XL for the Performance of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Assay in a Low-Incidence Tuberculosis Area."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper discusses the technology gap in todays newer hires where younger employees are often believed to be more technologically astute than they really are Younger employees are consumers of technology, but they have limited skills in using technology to solve business problems Design/methodology/approach: This paper reflects a review of theory and research on technology training and practice Findings: Three recommendations are presented that could aid employers in bridging the gap between technology literacy perceptions and actual practice: build proficiency of business software, be the convener of learning in digitally focused training programs, and applying design thinking in business settings Originality/value: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have been forced to incorporate more technology applications in their operations This has exposed a paradoxical gap between perceived technology knowledge in their younger employees and actual skill sets This article describes practical suggestions for enhancing corporate training programs to address this challenge ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Technological illiteracy in an increasingly technological world: methods to help employees create with rather than simply consume technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Azithromycin (AZM) is a macrolide antibiotic used for the treatment of various bacterial infections. The drug is known to have low oral bioavailability (37%) which may be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight, low solubility, dissolution rate, and incomplete intestinal absorption. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid (L) and solid (S) self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDs) of AZM were developed and optimized. Eight different pseudo-ternary diagrams were constructed based on the drug solubility and the emulsification studies in various SEDDs excipients at different surfactant to co-surfactant (Smix) ratios.

As part of explorative tests on patients participating in a clinical trial we measured baseline cytokine levels Millipore technology to IL-6 amongst other cytokines on COVID-19 positive, hospitalized patients (n = 60). We report IL-6 that is mildly elevated, however, a small percentage of patients have very high levels of IL-6. Furthermore, excessive IL-6 plasma levels correlate with mortality. We explore the genetic landscape of IL-6 region in association to COVID-19 outcomes. We have conducted whole-genome sequencing on 60 participants. We explore the role of genetic regulatory variants affecting baseline IL-6 levels specifically in COVID-19 patients. We provide results of common known IL6 variant previously associated with pneumonia, rs1800795 as well as report novel variants detected in our study patients. IL6-174 G/C (rs1800795) is a gene polymorphism in the promoter of the IL-6 gene. It has been previously reported in relation to serum IL6 in Egyptian children with community-acquired pneumonia. Interestingly in our study the minor allele seems to correlate with mortality. It is a common variant with a global MAF of 0.68 (higher in males and large allelic differences between East Asian (1) and European (0.55)). Looking at mortality 2 of the 3 people having the minor hom, died, as shown on Table 1. The minor allele for this variant would then be a risk locus significantly associated with higher mortality and perhaps a biomarker of need of earlier intervention. We have also inspected WGS samples from our COVID-19 patients for the presence of LOF IL6 variants and we do not report any such variants in this study cohort. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of modifiers of serum IL6 level on a set of Covid-19 positive whole-genome sequencing samples. We have directly tested the association between variants in the IL6 and IL6R region and IL6 plasma levels. Linear regression corrected for PCs and covariates identified a strong significant signal within IL6R region, specifically rs7525477. The minor allele associated with higher IL6 levels is shown on Figure 1. Furthermore, the variant is a significant eQTL for expression of TDRD10 in the lung tissue, a gene associated previously associated with IL6R level.

These databases provide information about potential molecular mediators such as mRNA expression, protein expression, and DNA methylation levels, which can be interrogated to map genetic signals to specific genes based on identification of causal pathways between the genetic signal and the phenotype being studied. Functional evaluation of potential causative genes has been facilitated by characterization of the osteocyte signature, by broad phenotyping of knockout mice with deletions of over 7,000 genes, in which more detailed skeletal phenotyping is currently being undertaken, and by development of zebrafish as a highly efficient additional in vivo model for functional studies of the skeleton.

METHODS: Population-based surveillance was conducted in the western interior of British Columbia, Canada, between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2020. Chart reviews were conducted for clinical details and all cause case-fatality was established at 30-days follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 1854 incident BSI were identified among 1657 individuals aged 65 and older for an annual incidence of 533.9 per 100,000 population; the incidence for those aged 65-74, 75-84, and 85 years was 375.3, 678.9, and 1046.6 per 100,000 population, respectively. Males were at significantly increased risk as compared to females (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.44; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.32-1.59; p<0.0001). The crude annual incidence increased by 50% during the study. However, this was related to shift in population demographics with no increase evident following age- and sex-standardization. Older patients were more likely to have healthcare-associated infections and genitourinary sources and less likely to have bone/joint or soft tissue infections.

METHODS: Enrolled parents of adolescents aged 9-17 years who received the first HPV vaccine dose at 1 of the 4 academic-affiliated community health clinics in New York City were randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 2 parallel, unblinded arms: precision SMS text messages (which included stage-targeted educational information, next dose due date, and site-specific walk-in hours) or conventional SMS text messages without educational information. Randomization was stratified according to gender, age, and language. The primary outcome was series completion within 12 months. In post hoc analysis, enrollees were compared with concurrent nonenrollees and historical controls. RESULTS: Overall, 956 parents were enrolled in the study. The precision (475 families) and conventional (481 families) SMS text message arms had similarly high series completion rates (344/475, 72.4% vs 364/481, 75.7%). A total of 42 days after the first dose, two-thirds of families, not initially in the preparation stage, moved to preparation or vaccinated stage. Those in either SMS text message arm had significantly higher completion rates than nonenrollees (708/1503, 47.1% vs 679/1503, 45.17%; P<.001).

However, the role of S100A9 in lung injury in sepsis has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the role of S100A9 in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury murine model and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: LPS was utilized to induce sepsis and lung injury in C57BL/6 or NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-/- mice. To investigate the effects of S100A9 blockade, mice were treated with a specific inhibitor of S100A9. Subsequently, lung injury and inflammation were evaluated by histology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Furthermore, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR were carried out to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of S100A9. RESULTS: S100A9 was upregulated in the lung tissues of LPS-treated mice. However, inhibition of S100A9 alleviated LPS-induced lung injury. Additionally, S100A9 blockade also attenuated the inflammatory responses and apoptosis in the lungs of LPS-challenged mice. Furthermore, the increased expression of NLRP3 was also suppressed by S100A9 blockade, while S100A9 blockade had no effect on NLRP3-/- mice. In vitro, S100A9 downregulation mitigated LPS-induced inflammation. Interestingly, these effects were blunted by NLRP3 overexpression. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggested that inhibition of S100A9 could protect against LPS-induced lung injury via inhibiting the NLRP3 pathway. Therefore, S100A9 blockade could be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for lung injury in sepsis.","output":"S100A9 blockade prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury via suppressing the NLRP3 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Functional tests for the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) exhibit variable performance. OBJECTIVES We evaluated in a multicentre study whether 5B9, a monoclonal anti-PF4/heparin IgG mimicking human HIT antibodies, could be used as an internal quality control. METHODS 5B9 was sent to eleven laboratories in seven countries, and six initial concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 g/ml were tested by heparin-induced platelet activation assay (HIPA), serotonin release assay (SRA), platelet aggregation test (PAT), flow cytometry (FC) or heparin-induced multiple-electrode aggregometry (HIMEA). Each method was evaluated in three different laboratories, using experimental procedures identical to those usually applied for the diagnosis of HIT, by testing platelets from 10 different healthy donors. RESULTS the procedures used varied among the laboratories, particularly when platelet-rich plasma and whole blood were employed. Nevertheless, positive results were obtained with at least 100 g/ml of 5B9 for most donors tested by all centres (except one) performing HIPA, SRA, or HIMEA. FC and PAT results were more heterogeneous. FC results from one centre that used washed platelets pre-incubated with PF4 were positive with all donors at 50 g/mL 5B9, but at least 200 g/ml of 5B9 were required to activate cells with most donors tested using PAT. CONCLUSION this study confirms that HIT functional tests are not well standardized and exhibit variable sensitivity for the detection of platelet-activating antibodies. However, 5B9 is a potentially useful tool to standardize functional tests, to select responding platelet donors, and consequently to improve the performance of these assays and comparability between laboratories.","output":"Multicentre evaluation of 5B9, a monoclonal anti-PF4/heparin IgG mimicking human hit antibodies, as an internal quality control in hit functional assays: communication from the isth ssc subcommittee on platelet immunology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Trauma, natural and man-made catastrophic events can be predictors of postpartum psychological distress. In a public health response due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the Italian government imposed a lockdown from March 9 to May 3. This extraordinary situation may have been challenging for maternal psychological health. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in women giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associations with quarantine measures, obstetrical factors, and relational attachment style. Methods: Women who gave birth in a high-volume obstetric/gynaecological medical centre located in an epidemic area during the Covid-19 pandemic (March 8 to June 15) were asked to complete an online survey about their childbirth experience and the perceived effect of the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) were administered to assess levels of postpartum depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and relational style of attachment, respectively. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify associations between quarantine measures, childbirth experience, attachment style, and EPDS and IES-R scores. Results: The survey was completed by 163 women (response rate 60.8%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 44.2% (EPDS cut-off score 11) and the PTSS rate was 42.9% (IES-R cut-off score 24). Dismissive and fearful avoidant attachment styles were significantly associated with the risk of depression and PTSS, respectively. Perceived pain during birth was a risk factor for postpartum depression. Perceived support provided by healthcare staff was a protective factor against depression and PTSS. Another protective factor against PTSS was quiet on the ward due to the absence of hospital visitors. Conclusion: This study reports a high prevalence of postpartum depressive and PTSS in women who gave birth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Postnatal psychological distress seemed to be associated more with the prenatal experience and other individual factors than with the pandemic hospital restrictions. Early detection during pregnancy of an insecure attachment style is fundamental to provide targeted preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions.","output":"Psychosocial factors associated with postpartum psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"THC has been used as a promising treatment approach for neurological disorders, but the highly psychoactive effects have largely warned off many scientists from pursuing it further. We conducted an intranasal treatment using low-dose THC on 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice daily for 3 months to overcome any potential psychoactive response induced by the systemic delivery. Our results demonstrate that the THC nasal treatment at 0.002 and 0.02 mg/kg significantly slowed the memory decline compared to that in the vehicle-treated transgenic mouse control group. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the A?1-40 and 1-42 peptides decreased in the THC-treated groups. The Western blot data indicate that long-term low-dose THC intranasal administration promoted p-tau level reduction and mitochondrial function marker redistribution. The blood biochemical parameter data demonstrate some insignificant changes in cytokine, immunoglobulin, and immune cell profiles during intranasal THC treatment. Intranasal delivery is a non-invasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the brain, minimizing systemic exposure to avoid unwanted adverse effects.

Methods Since their start, the two Italian population-based surveillance systems PASSI (18-69yy) and PASSI d'Argento (65+) have investigated health-related lifestyles. The continuous monthly data collection allows observation of changes in the short, medium and long terms. We compared prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use, physical activity, PA, or inactivity, PI, before and after March 2020, to evaluate temporal trends with particular concern to changes due to the pandemic. Results Sedentariness has been growing among inactive adults but in pandemic time, we observed a 10% significant reduction compared to 2019, due to a significant increase of spare time PA from 42% (2019) to 45% (2020) and a reduction of spare time PI from 42% to 39%. Despite a stable trend, elderly increased significantly PI, from 40% (2019) to 43% (2020). PI goes from 46% to 52% among Southern residents and from 45% to 53% in poorly educated people. Since 2008, at-risk alcohol consumption gradually increased in adults because of binge-drinking and between meals modalities. In 2018, a tendency inversion started and finds confirmation during the pandemic: binge-drinking decreases significantly from dal 9.5% (2019) to 8.2% (2020), between meals from 9.4% to 8.6%. During the pandemic, elderly increase alcohol consumption significantly, from 39% (2019) to 45% (2020), attributable to changes in moderate use by women: 17% in 2019 vs. 25% in 2020 overall;from 20% to 30% in highly educated and from 15% to 21% in poorly educated.

These self-assembly systems may also be used in understanding the molecular and structural biology which can inspire the design and synthesis of increasingly complex biomaterials. Specifically, use of these building blocks to investigate protein folding and misfolding has been of particular value since it can provide tremendous insights into peptide aggregation related to a variety of protein misfolding diseases, or amyloid diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes). Herein, the self-assembly of TK9, a nine-residue peptide of the extra membrane C-terminal tail of the SARS corona virus envelope, and its variants were characterized through biophysical, spectroscopic, and simulated studies, and it was confirmed that the structure of these peptides influences their aggregation propensity, hence, mimicking amyloid proteins. TK9, which forms a beta-sheet rich fibril, contains a key sequence motif that may be critical for beta-sheet formation, thus making it an interesting system to study amyloid fibrillation. TK9 aggregates were further examined through simulations to evaluate the possible intra- and interpeptide interactions at the molecular level. These self-assembly peptides can also serve as amyloid inhibitors through hydrophobic and electrophilic recognition interactions. Our results show that TK9 inhibits the fibrillation of hIAPP, a 37 amino acid peptide implicated in the pathology of type-II diabetes. Thus, biophysical and NMR experimental results have revealed a molecular level understanding of peptide folding events, as well as the inhibition of amyloid-protein aggregation are reported.","output":"Self-assembly of a nine-residue amyloid-forming peptide fragment of SARS corona virus E-protein: mechanism of self aggregation and amyloid-inhibition of hIAPP."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most perinatal research relating to COVID-19 focuses on its negative impact on maternal and parental mental health. Currently, there are limited data on how to optimise positive health during the pandemic. We aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring how women have adapted to becoming a new parent during the pandemic and to identify elements of resilience and growth within their narratives. Mothers of infants under the age of 4 months were recruited as part of a wider UK mixed-methods study. Semi-structured interviews with 20 mothers elicited data about how COVID-19 had influenced their transition to parent a new infant, and if and how they adapted during the pandemic, what strategies they used, and if and how these had been effective. Directed qualitative content analysis was undertaken, and pre-existing theoretical frameworks of resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) were used to analyse and interpret the data set. The findings show evidence of a range of resilience and PTG concepts experienced during the pandemic in this cohort. Salient resilience themes included personal (active coping, reflective functioning, and meaning-making), relational (social support, partner relationships, and family relationships), and contextual (health and social connectedness) factors. There was also evidence of PTG in terms of the potential for new work-related and leisure opportunities, and women developing wider and more meaningful connections with others. Although further research is needed, and with individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, these findings emphasise the significance of social support and connectivity as vital to positive mental health.

In addition, it is unclear how well short-term measures of fitness predict long-term genotypic success for species with dormancy. Here, we address these issues using experimental field populations of the plant Oenothera biennis, which evolved over five generations in plots exposed to or protected from insect herbivory. While populations existed above ground, there was rapid evolution of defensive and life-history traits, but populations lost genetic diversity and crashed as succession proceeded. After >5 y of seed dormancy, we triggered germination from the seedbank and genotyped >3,000 colonizers. Resurrected populations showed restored genetic diversity that reduced earlier responses to selection and pushed population phenotypes toward the starting conditions of a decade earlier.

Gene mutations that disturb this turnover process may cause skin diseases. Human GASDERMIN A (GSDMA) is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and its overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness in genetic association studies. The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting. Since mitochondrial ROS has been shown to promote epidermal differentiation, we hypothesize that Gsdma3 regulates context-dependent response of keratinocytes to differentiation and cell death signals by impinging on mitochondria.

We used lacZ left-frameshift reporter constructs carrying the sequence U UUC xyz, where xyz was each of three triplets coding for three different amino acids; we slowed the ribosomes at each of these by limiting for the amino acid or for the aminoacyl-tRNA. In all cases, limitation stimulated leftward frameshifting. In all cases, the stimulation was greater in relA mutant cells than in their wild-type relA (+) counterparts. In the latter genotype, the increased frameshifting was constant from the start of the limitation regime. This was also true of the relA mutant strain during limitation for lysine-tRNA or for leucine; however, during limitation for isoleucine-tRNA (or for isoleucine) the mutant showed a gradual, progressive increase in frameshifting, suggesting an indirect effect. We suggest that gradual accumulation of undermodified tRNAs, which is characteristic of the relA response, is involved. However, the specific modification involved is unknown. It is not queosine: analysis of a tgt mutant that is completely defective in queosine modification showed no increase in leftward frameshifting on the reporter which showed the larger, gradual increase during the relA response to isoleucine-tRNA limitation.","output":"Influence of the relA gene on ribosome frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Event-driven primary endpoints are increasingly used in pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trials, substantially increasing required sample sizes and trial lengths. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advocates the use of prognostic enrichment of clinical trials by preselecting a patient population with increased likelihood of experiencing the trial's primary endpoint. OBJECTIVE: This study compares validated clinical scales of risk (COMPERA, the French score, and REVEAL 2.0) to identify patients that are likely to experience a clinical worsening event for trial enrichment. METHODS: Baseline data from three pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trials (AMBITION, SERAPHIN, and GRIPHON) were pooled and standardized. Receiver-operating curves were used to measure each algorithm's performance in predicting clinical worsening within the pooled placebo cohort. Power simulations were conducted to determine sample size and treatment time reductions for multiple enrichment strategies. A cost analysis was performed to illustrate potential financial savings by applying enrichment to GRIPHON. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All risk algorithms were compared using area under the receiver-operating curve and substantially outperformed prediction per New York Heart Association Functional Class. REVEAL 2.0's risk grouping provided the greatest time and sample size savings in AMBITION and GRIPHON for all enrichment strategies but lacked appropriate inputs (i.e., N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) to perform as well in SERAPHIN. Cost analysis applied to GRIPHON demonstrated the greatest financial benefit by enrolling patients with a REVEAL score &#8805;8.

Studies indicate that south-west monsoon season plays a role in the dynamics of contagious diseases, which tend to peak post-monsoon season. Recent studies show that vitamin D and its primary source Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation may play a protective role in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. However, the combined roles of the monsoon season and UVB radiation in COVID-19 in India remain still unclear. In this observational study, we empirically study the respective roles of monsoon season and UVB radiation, whilst further exploring, whether the monsoon season negatively impacts the protective role of UVB radiation in COVID-19 deaths in India. We use a log-linear Mundlak model to a panel dataset of 36 administrative regions in India from 14 March 2020-19 November 2020 (n = 6751). We use the cumulative COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable. We isolate the association of monsoon season and UVB radiation as measured by Ultraviolet Index (UVI) from other confounding time-constant and time-varying region-specific factors. After controlling for various confounding factors, we observe that a unit increase in UVI and the monsoon season are separately associated with 1.2 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points decline in growth rates of COVID-19 deaths in the long run. These associations translate into substantial relative changes. For example, a permanent unit increase of UVI is associated with a decrease of growth rates of COVID-19 deaths by 33% (= - 1.2 percentage points) However, the monsoon season, mitigates the protective role of UVI by 77% (0.92 percentage points). Our results indicate a protective role of UVB radiation in mitigating COVID-19 deaths in India. Furthermore, we find evidence that the monsoon season is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVB radiation.

METHODS Tongue picture was taken by digital camera and colors (red, green and blue) of tongue proper and coating were analyzed quantitatively with image processing software. RESULTS In the 69 patients of acute stage, the color of tongue proper was mostly light red (51 patients, 73.9%), with significant difference in comparing with other colors (P < 0.01). The color of tongue coating was mostly thin yellow (32 patients, 46.4%), and thin white was the second (29 patients, 42.0%). There was swollen tongue body in 5 patients (7.2%), teeth print on tongue margin in 12 cases (17.4%). In the 155 patients of recovery stage, the color of tongue proper was mostly dark pale (72 patients, 46.5%), the second light red (68 patients, 43.9%), color of tongue coating was mostly thin white (80 patients, 51.6%), which was significantly higher than other colors (P < 0.01), the second was yellow in tongue root region (31 patients, 20.0%). Swollen tongue body was found in 23 patients (14.8%) and teeth print on margin was found in 19 patients (12.3%). Most patients of ordinary state had light red tongue proper and thin white coating, patients of severe state mostly had dark pale tongue proper and yellow coating in root region, and the critical patients were mostly with dark pale proper and thick yellow coating. Patients with affected lung > or = 3 lobules mostly had pale dark proper and yellow coating on root, but those with involved lung < 3 lobules mostly had light red proper and thin white coating.

Limited data exist comparing single-port with conventional laparoscopy for right colectomy. Our aim is to compare single-port with laparoscopic colectomy with regard to safety and feasibility. We assert that this approach can be adopted in a safe and efficacious manner while using standard laparoscopic instrumentation. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data regarding 16 single-port and 27 conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed by a single surgeon between January 2008 and February 2009. Demographics, operative outcomes, and morbidity were included and analyzed using either Student t test or Fisher exact probability test. RESULTS Single-port and conventional laparoscopic groups were similar with regard to age, gender, body mass index, prior abdominal surgery, and co-morbidity. Seventy-five percent and 70% of the operations were performed for malignancy in the single-port and the conventional laparoscopy group, respectively (P = .69). Operative duration was 106 minutes in the single-port group vs 100 minutes in the conventional group (P = .64). Blood loss was 54 mL and 90 mL, respectively (P = .07). No conversions or additions of ports occurred. Hospital stay was 5.3 days in the single-port group vs 6 days in the conventional group (P = .53). Margins were negative in both groups. Mean lymph node number was 18 and 16 nodes (P = .92). There was one death in the conventional group (P = .44). Morbidity including wound infection was 18.8% and 14.9%, respectively (P = .73). CONCLUSIONS These findings support single-port right colectomy as a safe and efficacious approach to right colon resections in patients eligible for laparoscopy with minimal additional equipment or learning curve for experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons. The single port was undertaken without an increase in morbidity or mortality. There was no increase in operative time with use of the single-port approach.

A structural equation model was used to test the hypotheses. RESULTS: Exposure to domestic violence was significantly associated with PTG and PTSD via a 1-step indirect path of self-compassion (PTG:  = -0.023, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.007; PTSD:  = 0.008, 95%CI: 0.002, 0.014) and via a 2-step indirect path from self-compassion to resilience (PTG:  = -0.008, 95%CI: -0.018 to -0.002; PTSD:  = 0.013, 95%CI: 0.004-0.024).

The heterogeneity of PDAC makes it difficult to apply drug delivery systems (DDS) used in other cancer models, for example, the poorly developed vascular system makes anti-angiogenic therapy ineffective. Due to its various malignant pathological changes, drug delivery against PDAC is a matter of urgent concern. Based on this situation, various drug delivery strategies specially designed for PDAC have been generated. AREAS COVERED This review will briefly describe how delivery systems can be designed through nanotechnology and formulation science. Most research focused on penetrating the stromal barrier, exploiting and alleviating the hypoxic microenvironment, targeting immune cells, or designing vaccines, and combination therapies. This review will summarize the ways to reverse the malignant pathological features of PDAC and hopefully provide ideas for subsequent studies. EXPERT OPINION Drug delivery systems designed to achieve penetrating functions or to alleviate hypoxia and activate immunity have achieved good therapeutic results in animal models in several studies. In future studies, there is a need to deliver PDAC therapeutics in a more precise manner, or the use of drug carriers for multiple functions simultaneously, are potential therapeutic strategy.","output":"Recent advances in targeted drug delivery for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: A COVID-19 pandemic business continuity plan (BCP) was rapidly developed to protect the Victorian newborn screening (NBS) program.

The effect was assessed quantitatively by review of key performance indicator data and qualitatively from staff feedback. RESULTS: A four-stage BCP was implemented. Stage 1 split teams into two, which rotated weekly, onsite (laboratory) and offsite (home). At 20 weeks post-implementation the BCP only progressed to stage 1 and the overall turnaround time was maintained. Staff experience indicated benefits from the review of workflow but noted some social impact associated with the change.

One functions as a conserved male antiaphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in combination with auditory signals. Unexpectedly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically, and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection, and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinated manner.","output":"Mate discrimination among subspecies through a conserved olfactory pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract With the pervasive nature of chronic kidney disease, kidney transplantation is likely to continue to increase in the coming years.

These are described classically via timeline with early infections (first month), middle (1 to 6 months), and late (after 6 months). Kidney transplant patients may suffer from infections secondary to a vast array of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

We assessed feasibility, acceptability, and usability of RCPeer using mixed-methods. System Usability Scale (SUS) scores were 68 for peers and 66 for RCs, indicating good usability. Qualitative data suggests that RCPeer can support reentry tasks through RCs and peers sharing data, strengthen RC-peer relationships, and facilitate RCs meeting their goals.

The purpose of this study is twofold. This paper first analyzes the direct relationship between DC and organizational agility dimensions (i.e. customer, operational and partnering agilities). Second, this paper investigates the direct link between organizational agility dimensions and a firms organizational crisis preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of Moroccan firms administrated during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, a theoretically derived model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that DC are significantly related to the three types of agility and that only customer and operational agility affect organizational crisis preparedness.

There is conflicting evidence however on whether timely follow-up with a primary care provider reduces that risk. The objective of this study is to understand the perspectives of patients with COPD and CHF, and their caregivers, on the role of primary care provider follow-up after hospital discharge. METHODS: A qualitative study design with semi-structured interviews was conducted among patients or their family caregivers admitted with COPD or CHF who were enrolled in a randomized controlled study at three acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Participants were interviewed between December 2017 to January 2019, the majority discharged from hospital at least 30 days prior to their interview. Interviews were analyzed independently by three authors using a deductive directed content analysis, with the fourth author cross-comparing themes. RESULTS: Interviews with 16 participants (eight patients and eight caregivers) revealed four main themes. First, participants valued visiting their primary care provider after discharge to build upon their longitudinal relationship. Second, primary care providers played a key role in coordinating care. Third, there were mixed views on the ideal time for follow-up, with many participants expressing a desire to delay follow-up to stabilize following their acute hospitalization. Fourth, the link between the post-discharge visit and preventing hospital readmissions was unclear to participants, who often self-triaged based on their symptoms when deciding on the need for emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers valued in-person follow-up with their primary care provider following discharge from hospital because of the trust established through pre-existing longitudinal relationships. Our results suggest policy makers should focus on improving rates of primary care provider attachment and systems supporting informational continuity.

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canadas guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","output":"Digital Interventions to Support Population Mental Health in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sex differences in the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system have been widely reported.

Herein, a colorimetic serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in patients plasma was developed using short antigenic epitopes conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Four immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes, located on the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2, were characterized for their IgG binding affinity and used as highly specific biological motifs on the nanoparticle to recognize target antibodies. Specific bivalent binding between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and epitope-functionalized AuNPs trigger nanoparticle aggregation, which manifests as a distinct optical transition in the AuNPs plasmon characteristics within 30 min of antibody introduction. Co-immobilization of two epitopes improved the assay sensitivity relative to single-epitope AuNPs with a limit of detection of 3.2 nM, commensurate with IgG levels in convalescent COVID-19-infected patients. A passivation strategy was further pursued to preserve the sensing response in human plasma medium. When tested against 35 clinical plasma samples of varying illness severity, the optimized nanosensor assay can successfully identify SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. As the epitopes are conserved within the circulating COVID-19 variants, the proposed platform holds great potential to serve as a cost-effective and highly specific alternative to classical immunoassays employing recombinant viral proteins.

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

Previous work showed that optimizing secondary structure stability lengthens mRNA half-life, which, together with optimal codons, increases protein expression. Therefore, a principled mRNA design algorithm must optimize both structural stability and codon usage to improve mRNA efficiency. However, due to synonymous codons, the mRNA design space is prohibitively large, e.g., there are $\\\\sim\\\\!10^{632}$ mRNAs for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which poses insurmountable challenges to previous methods. Here we provide a surprisingly simple solution to this hard problem by reducing it to a classical problem in computational linguistics, where finding the optimal mRNA is akin to finding the most likely sentence among similar sounding alternatives. Our algorithm, named LinearDesign, takes only 11 minutes for the Spike protein, and can jointly optimize stability and codon usage. Experimentally, without chemical modification, our designs substantially improve mRNA half-life and protein expression in vitro, and dramatically increase antibody response by up to 23$\\\\times$ in vivo, compared to the codon-optimized benchmark.

Data regarding these excess deaths is sparse, but necessary in order to avoid them in future waves. We investigated what factors contributed to excess deaths of older patients during the initial 2020 lockdown beyond those attributable to confirmed COVID-19. We hypothesized that both physical diseases and mental disorders would contribute.Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study using data from the electronic clinical records from Cambridge and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment area population ~ 0.86 million). Eligible patients were aged 65 years or over at baseline with at least 14 days follow-up, excluding patients diagnosed with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We defined a cohort exposed to COVID-19 lockdown comprising patients recorded in CPFT between March 23, 2020 and May 19, 2020, and compared their mortality with an cohort recorded in CPFT between January 13, 2020 and 10 March, 2020, unexposed to lockdown. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between risk factors and death. Controlled covariates included social demographic factors, smoking status, mental comorbidities, and physical comorbidities.Findings: In the two cohorts, 3,073 subjects were exposed to lockdown and 4,372 subjects were unexposed;the cohorts were followed up for an average of 74 days and 78 days, respectively. After controlling for confounding by sociodemographic factors, smoking status, mental comorbidities, and physical comorbidities, dementia patients suffered an additional 53% risk of death (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.02-2.31), and patients with severe mental illness suffered an additional 123% risk of death (HR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.42-3.49). No significant additional death risks were identified from physical comorbidities.Interpretation: During lockdown people with dementia or severe mental illness had a higher risk of excess death. This study suggests that such patients require additional support during a societal response to this and similar epidemics/pandemics. These data could inform future health service responses and policymaking to help prevent avoidable excess death during future outbreaks of similar infectious diseases.Funding Statement: SCs, PBJs, and RNCs research was supported by the Medical Research Council (grant MC_PC_17213 to RNC).

During lockdown, follow-up consultations in the intervention group were done by video and/or phone. After 3 months of lockdown, all patients (intervention and SC group) consented to a telephone interview which aimed to characterize eating habits and lifestyle changes and evaluate stress and depression. Biochemical data when available, was compared between the peri-period of confinement. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients were screened.

Previous agenda-setting studies share two shortfalls: they only account for direct connections between academic institutions and firms, as well as potential bias based on researchers personal beliefs. This papers goal is to determine the key actors and contents of the prevailing health and biomedical sciences (HBMS) research agenda, overcoming these shortfalls. METHODS: We performed a bibliometric and lexical analysis of 95,415 scientific articles published between 1999 and 2018 in the highest impact factor journals within HBMS, using the Web of Science database and the CorText platform. HBMSs prevailing knowledge network of institutions was proxied with network maps where nodes represent affiliations and edges the most frequent co-authorships. The content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda was depicted through network maps of prevalent multi-terms found in titles, keywords, and abstracts. RESULTS: The HBMS research agendas of large private firms and leading academic institutions are intertwined. The prevailing HBMS agenda is mostly based on molecular biology (40% of the most frequent multi-terms), with an inclination towards cancer and cardiovascular research (15 and 8% of the most frequent multi-terms, respectively). Studies on pathogens and biological vectors related to recent epidemics are marginal (1% of the most frequent multi-terms). Content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda prioritizes research on pharmacological intervention over research on socio-environmental factors influencing disease onset or progression and overlooks, among others, the study of infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical corporations contribute to set HBMSs prevailing research agenda, which is mainly focused on a few diseases and research topics. A more balanced research agenda, together with epistemological approaches that consider socio-environmental factors associated with disease spreading, could contribute to being better prepared to prevent and treat more diverse pathologies and to improve overall health outcomes.","output":"Whose shoulders is health research standing on?

First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individua?s susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID-19. We studied 204 COVID-19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 insertion/deletion and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Severe COVID-19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1- genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95%CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95%CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID-19. In conclusion, an adverse outcome of COVID-19 was associated with male gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and the ACE1 genotype.

Thrombotic complications due to considerable inflammation, cytokine-mediated microvascular damage and pulmonary immunothrombosis formation seem to have emerged as an important issue in people infected with COVID-19. METHODS: This study reviewed consecutive symptomatic patients with proven COVID-19 infection admitted to Acibadem University Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey (15 March-25 May 2020). The primary outcome was any venous thromboembolic (VTE) complication. The secondary outcome was the incidence of subsegmental pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which represented immunothrombosis development. RESULTS: The mean age was 55.717.4 years (range, 29-84); 224 (63.6%) were men. Of those patients, 12 (3.4%) died, 273 (77.5%) were discharged alive and 67 (19.1%) were still hospitalised as of 25 May 2020. Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 58 patients with a cumulative rate of 16.4% during the study period. The surprising discovery was that DVT was not identified in 20 (86.9%) of the 23 patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism, which corroborated the pulmonary immunothrombosis theory. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of VTE events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Thus, repeated assessment and optimised treatment are necessary to reduce the occurrence of VTE and prevent fatal pulmonary embolism events. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism of this immunothrombosis development.","output":"Subsegmental Thrombus in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Immunothrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism?

Since the uptake of e-commerce and e-services has seen unprecedented serge in recent months due to the global COVID-19 pandemic era, the security of such transactions in optical communication has gained much importance. Optical fiber communication networks are vulnerable to several types of security threats, such as single point failure, wormhole attacks, and sybil attacks. Therefore, blockchain is a promising solution to protect confidential information against attacks and helps in achieving trusted network architecture by creating a distributed ledger platform. Recently, blockchain has received much attention because of its decentralized and distributed ledger technology. Hence, blockchain has also been employed to protect network against such attacks. However, blockchain technology's security relies on the platform of computational complexity, and because of the evolution of quantum computers, it will become insecure in the near future. Therefore, for enhancing blockchain security, research focus on combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with blockchain. This new technology is known as quantum-secured blockchain. The article describes the attacks in optical networks and provides a solution to protect network against security attacks by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It provides a brief overview of blockchain technology with its security loopholes and focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more robust against quantum-attacks.

METHODS: This epidemiological survey was conducted in Ribeir?o Preto, Brazil, a medium-sized city. Stratified sampling was performed, with data collected on demographics, health, LTCF protective measures, activities of daily living, and cognition. A serological test was carried out on all selected individuals. RESULTS: The mean resident and worker ages were 80.62 (SD, 9.66) and 37.41 (SD, 12.42) years, respectively. The serological test was positive in 13.33% of the residents, who had 2.91 (SD, 1.28) chronic diseases and used 5.65 (SD, 2.79) medications.

This study analyzed the viral genome sequencing data of 108 samples collected from patients infected with Omicron. First, we found that the enrichment efficiency of viral nucleic acids was reduced due to mutations in the region where the primers anneal to. Second, the Omicron variant possesses an excessive number of mutations compared to other variants circulating at the same time (62 vs. 45), especially in the Spike gene. Mutations in the Spike gene confer alterations in 32 amino acid residues, which was more than those observed in other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, a large number of nonsynonymous mutations occur in the codons for the amino acid residues located on the surface of the Spike protein, which could potentially affect the replication, infectivity, and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Third, there are 53 mutations between the Omicron variant and its closest sequences available in public databases. Many of those mutations were rarely observed in the public database and had a low mutation rate. In addition, the linkage disequilibrium between these mutations were low, with a limited number of mutations (6) concurrently observed in the same genome, suggesting that the Omicron variant would be in a different evolutionary branch from the currently prevalent variants.

Since different temperatures encountered in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (33C and 37C, respectively) have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several respiratory viruses, as well as host innate immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection using the primary human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated to higher titers when infections were performed at 33C rather than 37C. Although both viruses were highly sensitive to type I and type III interferon pretreatment, a detailed time-resolved transcriptome analysis revealed temperature-dependent interferon and pro-inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 that were inversely proportional to its replication efficiency at 33C or 37C.

We evaluated the clinical and psychological impact of this imposed isolation on the older population with T1D. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with older adults with T1D who were part of an ongoing study, which was paused from March - August 2020. The interviews were performed between May - August 2020, and were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using content analysis to derive theme.

Results: We have analyzed 12/35 interviews at this time;mean age 744 years, 50% female, 92% non-Hispanic white, mean duration of diabetes 3718 years, and A1C 7.30.7%. Three main themes have emerged. The challenges related to diabetes care included fear of hypoglycemia, interruption in supply chain related to diabetes technology (insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) supplies), use of telehealth, diabetes-related distress, and adapting to new routines in self-care (diet and exercise). Challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic included fear of getting Covid-19 infection, and a lack of reliable information on pandemic. The challenges related to psychological well-being included a feeling of isolation, loneliness, inability to spend time with family and friends, lack of in-person communication, and lack of recreational activity.

The fierce debate over the exercise of discretionary power by platforms to terminate users ' accounts and remove content has primarily focused on free speech ramifications and the constitutional restraints on top-down legal interventions. While suspension and removal decisions by platforms often trigger questions situated in public law, they also raise important challenges to private law. Cutting the livelihood of small businesses, independent creators and political activists, termination and removal decisions may carry irreparable financial and reputational harms. When moderating content, digital platforms exercise discretionary powers conferred under boilerplate contracts defining their Terms of Service. So far, platforms have successfully invoked contractual provisions as a shield against lawsuits of users claiming that unjustified suspension was a breach of contract. This Article argues that courts have often erroneously dismissed users' claims because they have misinterpreted the agreement between platforms and users as dyadic, namely involving two contracting parties. The interpretation of such contracts as establishing bilateral/vertical obligations only, undermines the true intention of the contracting parties and overlooks the plethora of rights and obligations created by such contracts to multiple stakeholders. The purpose of this Article is to highlight this blind spot in current contractual analysis and offer courts an interpretive framework for addressing contractual claims involving digital platforms. We argue that platforms' contracts should be interpreted as contractual networks. This analytical framework is based on a growing body of literature which focuses on interrelated contractual obligations among independent agents who share a common goal. Users in social media platforms, we argue, collaborate in creating the shared economic and social value generated by social media. By framing the contractual relationship between platforms and users as a contractual network, courts are called to consider this complexity and the extent to which removals or terminations meet the contractual expectations of the networks' members and advance their common goal. This approach to contract interpretation may facilitate a bottom-up check on content moderation via private ordering thus increasing platforms' accountability. Specifically, if users could effectively raise contractual claims against platforms and hold them accountablefor capricious, biased, or unfair removal decisions, they could pressure platforms to align content moderation policies with the shared interests of the community of users. To that end, contract law could empower users by offering a decentralized and diversified check over the platforms' content moderation practices. Holding platforms accountable for content moderation practices via private ordering could also facilitate more diversity and exploration, enabling the emergence of different models for moderating digital content and promoting a more pluralist public discourse.","output":"Social Media as Contractual Networks: A Bottom Up Check on Content Moderation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To observe the frequency, severity and susceptibility to develop the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome in confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19.

Methodology: After Ethical Committee approval in 164 patients of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who underwent the complication of ARDS were enrolled, admitted in department of Medicine and Intensive Care Unit at Lahore General Hospital, Lahore. After taking consent we studied different features in these patients like age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms, their radiological findings, SATS, PO2/FIO2 ratio, serum ferritin, CRP, LDH and d-dimer levels, and results were analyzed. Result: Out of 164 patients, 103 were COVID-19 positive. Mostly middle aged to old males developed the complications of ARDS. The most common symptoms observed were fever, cough and shortness of breath. Most common comorbidities present in the patients were diabetes and hypertension. HRCT was done in severe cases and 25 out of 35 patients had either unilateral or bilateral lung opacities. On chest X-ray 76% patients had bilateral lung infiltrates and 12% patients were having unilateral infiltrates. Inflammatory markers such as CRP, serum LDH, serum Ferritin, D-dimers were raised in most of the patients who developed moderate to severe ARDS. Conclusion: We concluded that the middle aged to old males with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension are more likely to undergo ARDS.

We discover that interventions that focus on protecting the most active individuals and most popular venues can significantly reduce the peak infection rate and the total number of infected people while retaining high levels of social activity overall. This trend is observed universally in multi-agent simulations using three mobility data sets of different scales, resolutions, and modalities (check-ins at seven different cities, WiFi connection events at a university, and GPS traces of electric bikes), and suggests that strategies that exploit the network effect in human mobility provide a better balance between disease control and normal social activities.","output":"Targeted Interventions Reduce the Spread of COVID-19: Simulation Study on Real Mobility Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Documentation of COVID-19 started happening around December 2019 from Wuhan, China, after which the world has been on a standstill with waves of COVID- 19 virus taking millions of lives worldwide.

Mutations on RBD have been observed in different countries and classified into nine types: A435S, D364Y, G476S, N354D/D364Y, R408I, V341I, V367F, V483A and W436R.

We then evaluated the impact of various mitigation strategies upon resuming activities. Results: The delay in achieving the elimination goals is on average similar to the number of years the treatment rounds are missed. Enhanced interventions implemented for as little as one year can allow catch-up on the progress lost, and if maintained throughout the programme can lead to acceleration of up to 3 years. Conclusions: In general, a short delay in the programme does not cause major delay in achieving the goals. Impact is strongest in high endemicity areas. Mitigation strategies such as biannual treatment or increased coverage are key to minimizing the impact of the disruption once the programme resumes; and lead to potential acceleration, should these enhanced strategies be maintained.","output":"Predicting the impact of disruptions in lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and possible mitigation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Untreated acquired auricular damage can be a psychological burden, especially for younger patients.

Here, we describe how to use porous polyethylene combined with an endoscopically harvested temporoparietal fascia flap and autologous skin grafts for the reconstruction of acquired partial auricle defects and present outcomes and patient benefit. Ten consecutive patients were asked to answer validated questionnaires [modified Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)] determining the effects of partial ear reconstruction on their health-related quality of life.

In the present study, we showed a suppression of PEDV infection in porcine jejunum intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) by an increase in autophagy. Autophagy was activated by rapamycin at a dose that does not affect cell viability and tight junction permeability. The induction of autophagy was examined by LC3I/LC3II conversion. To confirm the autophagic-flux (entire autophagy pathway), autophagolysosomes were examined by an immunofluorescence assay. Pre-treatment with rapamycin significantly restricted not only a 1 h infection but also a longer infection (24 h) with PEDV, while this effect disappeared when autophagy was blocked. Co-localization of PEDV and autophagosomes suggests that PEDV could be a target of autophagy. Moreover, alleviation of PEDV-induced cell death in IPEC-J2 cells pretreated with rapamycin demonstrates a protective effect of rapamycin against PEDV-induced epithelial cell death. Collectively, the present study suggests an early prevention against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells via autophagy that might be an effective strategy for the restriction of PEDV, and opens up the possibility of the use of rapamycin in vivo as an effective prophylactic and prevention treatment.","output":"Rapamycin-induced autophagy restricts porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infectivity in porcine intestinal epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Overexpression of TPD52-like family proteins in cancer has been linked to poor prognosis and an aggressive metastatic phenotype, which suggests cell migration may be altered under these conditions. Here, we show that TPD54 directly binds membrane and associates with INVs via a conserved positively charged motif in its C terminus. We describe how other TPD52-like proteins are also associated with INVs, and we document the Rab GTPase complement of all INVs.

All studies reporting upper-aerodigestive symptoms of COVID-19 infection were included. The meta-analysis was conducted following MOOSE guidelines which have evaluated the pooled prevalence of 14 symptoms and nine laboratory investigations. RESULTS Based on inclusion criteria, 67 publications consisting of 8302 patients were included. Among adults, the pooled proportion of hypertensive and diabetic patients was 18% and 7%. Cough [53% (0.46-0.61)], anosmia [38%(0.19-0.58)], loss/distortion of taste [31%(0.17-0.45)] and nasal obstruction [26%(0.12-0.39)] were the most common ear nose throat (ENT) symptom. Fever [69% (0.62-0.76)] and fatigue [31% (0.26-0.37)] were the commonest generalized symptoms. C-reactive protein(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) was raised in 56% (0.41-0.71) and 49%(0.21-0.77) respectively. Interestingly, lymphopenia [41% (0.30-0.53)] and leucopenia[22%(0.16-0.29)] were more common than lymphocytosis [33%(0.02-0.64)] and leucocytosis [12%(0.09-0.16)].

Belgium adopted broad inclusion criteria for the COVID-19 death notifications, also including possible cases, resulting in a robust correlation between COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. AIM: To document and assess the COVID-19 mortality surveillance in Belgium. METHODS: We described the content and data flows of the registration and we assessed the situation as of 21 June 2020, 103 days after the first death attributable to COVID-19 in Belgium. We calculated the participation rate, the notification delay, the percentage of error detected, and the results of additional investigations. RESULTS: The participation rate was 100% for hospitals and 83% for nursing homes. Of all deaths, 85% were recorded within 2 calendar days: 11% within the same day, 41% after 1 day and 33% after 2 days, with a quicker notification in hospitals than in LTCF.

In practice, a number of different transfusion protocols are in use across the developed world, with on-demand transfusion still being the paradigm in most of the developing world with limited resources. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS To investigate perceived differences in transfusion practice, a self-reported electronic survey was disseminated to eight US thalassemia treatment centers in February 2011. The survey was divided into sections ranging from laboratory and clinical practices to emerging transfusion-transmitted diseases. RESULTS The survey response rate was 100%. The total number of transfused patients was 411. One-hundred percent of institutions used leukoreduced blood. No centers routinely provided cytomegalovirus-seronegative red blood cells (RBCs). Half the centers provided irradiated RBCs; only one routinely provided washed RBCs, and none transfused RBCs of defined storage age. Seventy-five percent of centers routinely phenotyped thalassemia patients' RBC antigens; 50% prophylactically matched for Rh and K antigens. The frequency of antibody investigations varied widely, and 25% of centers routinely medicated patients before transfusion.

To show the evidence on psychological and social consequences of the use of NIPT, we conducted a scoping review. METHODS We systematically searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsychINFO (EBSCO)) for studies that investigated the psychological or social consequences of the use of NIPT by pregnant women or expecting parents. The search was limited to studies published between 2011 and August 8, 2018. We identified 2488 studies and, after removal of duplicates, screened 2007 titles and abstracts, and then assessed 99 articles in full text (both screenings were done independently in duplicate).

EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, &#945;-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","output":"A primary nasopharyngeal three-dimensional air-liquid interface cell culture model of the pseudostratified epithelium reveals differential donor- and cell type-specific susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus infectious disease (or COVID-19) almost spread widely around the world and causes a huge panic in the human population.

Two endogenous ligands of CLEC-2 have been identified, the transmembrane protein podoplanin, and iron-containing porphyrin hemin, which is formed following haemolysis from red blood cells. Other exogenous ligands such as rhodocytin have contributed to our understanding of the role of CLEC-2. OBJECTIVES To identify novel CLEC-2 small molecule ligands to aid therapeutic targeting of CLEC-2. METHODS ALPHA Screen technology has been used for development of a high throughput screening (HTS) assay recapitulating the podoplanin-CLEC-2 interaction. Light transmission aggregometry was used to evaluate platelet aggregation. Immunoprecipitation and western blot were used to evaluate direct phosphorylation of CLEC-2 and downstream protein phosphorylation. Autodock vina software was used to predict the molecular binding site of katacine and mass spectrometry to determine the polymeric nature of the ligand. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We developed a CLEC-2-podoplanin interaction assay in a HTS format and screened 5016 compounds from an EU-Open screen library. We identified katacine, a mixture of polymers of proanthocyanidins, as a novel ligand for CLEC-2 and showed that it induces platelet aggregation and CLEC-2 phosphorylation via Syk- and Src kinases. Platelet aggregation induced by katacine is inhibited by the anti-CLEC-2 monoclonal antibody fragment AYP1 F(ab)'2.

Thirty-five school aged children with at least three months of weightlifting experience were randomized to one of three training conditions: VF-PA, VF or the Control group (CONT). Subjects underwent test sessions one week before (T0) and one day after (T1) a six-session training period and a retention test session a week later (T2). During each test session, the Kinovea version 0.8.15 software measured the kinematic parameters of the snatch performance. Following distance learning sessions (T1), the VF-PA improved various kinematic parameters (i.e., barbell horizontal displacements, maximum height, looping and symmetry) compared with T0 (p < 0.5; Cohen's d = 0.58-1.1). Most of these improvements were maintained during the retention test (T2) (p<0.01, Cohen's d = 1.2-1.3) when compared withT0. However, the VF group improved only twoparameters (i.e., barbell symmetry and horizontal displacement) at T1 (p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.9), which were not maintained at T2.

We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\\\\f recent-onset COVID-19. METHODS: ACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany. Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days. Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score. Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUC(SOFA)), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353596. FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66C80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition. Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=042). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 000 (000C200) vs 100 (000C300); p=012). Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUC(SOFA) (000 [000C925] vs 350 [000C2350]; p=0040), mean SOFA score (000 [000C031] vs 012 [000C078]; p=0040), and 30-day SOFA score (000 [10C90th percentile, 000C120] vs 000 [000C2400]; p=0023). At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score 1) or were dead (p=0017). There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=087) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=096) between the discontinuation and continuation group. INTERPRETATION: Discontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery. The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.

These findings propose that treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma should be carefully targeted, and effectiveness of treatment may depend on the clinical and immunological status of COVID-19 patients as well as the quality of the antibodies in the convalescent plasma.","output":"Impact of convalescent plasma therapy on SARS CoV-2 antibody profile in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current health crisis caused by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated pathogens emphasize the urgent need for vaccine systems that can generate protective and long-lasting immune responses.

However, the vaccine candidate requires protection from degradation and precise delivery to the target cells. This can be achieved by employing different types of drug and vaccine delivery strategies, among which, nanotechnology-based systems seem to be more promising.

Until now not much is known about impact these different perfusion systems have on the brain. The objective of this study is to determine carnosinase and brain-type fatty binding protein (BFABP) activity as novel specific biomarkers for ischemic brain tissue damage and how their activity differs during and after MPC and CCPB as well as to compare the inflammatory response of both perfusion systems. In a prospective pilot study, 28 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly divided into an MPC group (n = 14) and a CCPB group (n = 14). Blood samples were taken before, during, and after operation until the fifth postoperative day. The brain biomarker carnosinase was determined by measuring the rate of histidine production from the substrate homocarnosine, whereas BFABP and interleukin-6 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). C-reactive protein (CRP) and endothelin-1 were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The mean serum carnosinase activity was significantly higher in MPC (0.57  0.34 nM histidine/mL/min) as compared with the CCPB group (0.36  0.13 nM histidine/mL/min) at the end of operation (P = 0.02). The BFABP did not show any difference between the two groups in the immediate postoperative period until the second postoperative day. From that time point onward, it showed a steep increase in the CCPB group (581.3  157.11 pg/mL) as compared with the concentrations in the MPC group (384.6  39 pg/mL) (P = 0.04). The inflammation markers interleukin-6 and CRP showed a similar pattern in both groups without significant difference. In contrast, the leukocyte count on operation day and endothelin-1 on the first postoperative day were significantly higher in the CCPB group (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, respectively). MPC showed a significant higher and stable serum carnosinase activity during extracorporeal circulation as compared with the CCPB due to less hemodilution and a better preserved oxygen capacity. As a consequence, the antioxidant stress during MPC is limited as compared with CCPB, which means less brain tissue damage reflected by a lower BFABP release. Except endothelin-1 and leukocyte count, the inflammatory response of the MPC and CCPB was equal.","output":"Effect of minimized perfusion circuit on brain injury markers carnosinase and brain-type fatty binding protein in coronary artery bypass grafting patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and broke out as a global pandemic in late 2019. The acidic pH environment of endosomes is believed to be essential for SARS-CoV-2 to be able to enter cells and begin replication. However, the clinical use of endosomal acidification inhibitors, typically chloroquine, has been controversial with this respect. METHODS: In this study, RT-qPCR method was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2N gene to evaluate viral replication. The CCK-8 assay was also used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. In situ hybridization was used to examine the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in lung tissues. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was also used to evaluate virus-associated pathological changes in lung tissues. RESULTS: In this study, analysis showed that endosomal acidification inhibitors, including chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and NH(4)CL, significantly reduced the viral yields of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6, Huh-7 and 293T-ACE2 cells. Chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 also improved the viability and proliferation of Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in the hACE2 transgenic mice model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 reduced viral replication in lung tissues and alleviated viral pneumonia with reduced inflammatory exudation and infiltration in peribronchiolar and perivascular tissues, as well as improved structures of alveolar septum and pulmonary alveoli. CONCLUSIONS: Our research investigated the antiviral effects of endosomal acidification inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in several infection models and provides an experimental basis for further mechanistic studies and drug development.","output":"Inhibitors of endosomal acidification suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and relieve viral pneumonia in hACE2 transgenic mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, presents with a broad constellation of both respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms, although it is primarily considered a respiratory disease. Gastrointestinal symptoms-including nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea-rank chief among these. When coupled with the presence of viral RNA in fecal samples, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms raises relevant questions regarding whether SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. Despite the well-documented prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the high rate of SARS-CoV-2 fecal RNA shedding, the biological, clinical, and epidemiological relevance of these findings is unclear. Furthermore, the isolation of replication-competent virus from fecal samples has not been reproducibly and rigorously demonstrated. Although SARS-CoV-2 shedding likely occurs in a high proportion of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms affect only a subset of individuals. Herein, we summarize what is known about gastrointestinal symptoms and fecal viral shedding in COVID-19, explore the role of the gut microbiome in other respiratory diseases, speculate on the role of the gut microbiota in COVID-19, and discuss potential future directions.

Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the 'inevitability' of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education's history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by 'technophilic' students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this 'overnight' response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really 'inevitable,' it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment's strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools.

The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variant D614G Favors an Open Conformational State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data are limited regarding risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and the significance of virologic documentation by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients.

SETTING: 5 hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. PATIENTS: Adults with COVID-19-related critical illness who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure or shock during the initial surge of the pandemic. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure for outcomes and care delivery trend analyses was longitudinal time during the pandemic. The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death at any time, receipt of mechanical ventilation (MV), and readmissions. RESULTS: Among 468 patients with COVID-19-related critical illness, 319 (68.2%) were treated with MV and 121 (25.9%) with vasopressors.

But for many people, spreadsheets - the quintessential table tool - remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and \\"get their hands on\\" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.","output":"Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has provided challenges for surgical residency programs demanding fluid decision making focused on providing care for our patients, maintaining an educational environment, and protecting the well-being of our residents.

This study evaluated the application of thoracoscopic techniques in more complex, unusual tracheal anomalies. METHODS From January 2002 to October 2008, 9 patients with more rare anatomic tracheal anomalies, between the thoracic inlet and the carina, were treated by thoracoscopy. Ages ranged from 5 months to 8 years and weights ranged from 5.4 to 8 years and from 5.9 to 42 kg. Pathology included 3 H-type TEFs, 2 recurrent TEFs following previous open repair of an esophageal atresia with fistula, resection of a giant tracheal pouch, and 3 tracheobronchi with associated abnormal lung parenchyma. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed thoracoscopically. Operative times ranged from 60 to 130 minutes. Procedures included division and closure of the 3 H-type fistulas and 2 recurrent fistulas, resection of the tracheal pouch, 2 upper lobectomies, and resection of an aberrant upper lobe segment by segmentectomy. There were no operative or postoperative complications. Chest tubes were left in for an average of 1 day, and hospital stay averaged 2.2 days. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopy provides an excellent technique for approaching tracheal pathology from the level of the thoracic inlet to the carina. A thoracoscopic approach avoids the morbidity of a major thoracotomy and virigule or a major neck exploration while providing greater exposure, especially in the upper thorax.","output":"Experience with thoracoscopic tracheal surgery in infants and children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 19(th)March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or measures. However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government restriction time series, to understand the best set of mitigating actions. Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model government restrictions in travelling, testing and enforcement of social distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwans lack of nationwide lockdown, i.e. earlier government actions could have contained the growth to a degree that a widespread lockdown would have been avoided, or at least delayed. The results, found with a purely data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.","output":"Optimisation of Non-Pharmaceutical Measures in COVID-19 Growth via Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Lymphatic filariasis is a serious public health issue. Recent studies showed that a single dosage of triple therapy (Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazepine, and Albendazole) is more effective than dual therapy (Ivermectin plus Albendazole or Diethylcarbamazepine plus Albendazole) for clearing microfilaria from the blood. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of triple therapy versus dual therapy in patients infected with microfilaria and communities endemic to lymphatic filariasis. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science until 24th June 2021. We included randomized control trials that compared triple to dual therapy given to patients with lymphatic filariasis or endemic communities. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021266724). RESULTS We included eight articles after the screening process. Triple therapy caused more clearance of microfilaria in the blood (RR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.02; P= 0.003), while dual therapy caused more clearance of the circulating filariae antigen in the blood (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.88; P= 0.0003), both 12 months after drug administration. The triple therapy had a similar adverse effect compared to the dual therapy group. CONCLUSION Based on the greater efficacy in the clearance of microfilaria and the safety of triple therapy, it constitutes a better strategy for the eradication programs of lymphatic filariasis in endemic regions.

X-ray crystallography revealed coordinated recognition by the heavy chain to conserved sites and the light chain to RBS, allowing for the mimicry of ACE2 binding mode. The minimum footprints in the hypervariable region of RBS contributed to the breadth of neutralization, and the activity was further enhanced by IgG3 switching. Eventually, the coordinated binding resulted in broad neutralization of SARS-CoV and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most prevalent form of ART. During IVF, a woman's eggs are extracted, fertilized in a laboratory setting, and then implanted in the uterus. Many IVF procedures use eggs or sperm that were stored using a process called cryopreservation. A recent survey reported that cryopreservation consultations increased exponentially during the coronavirus pandemic, rising as much as 60 percent. It is estimated that more than one million embryos are stored in cryopreservation facilities throughout the United States. As the use of cryopreservation increases, so too does the possibility that stored reproductive material will be lost or destroyed. Recently, over 4,000 cryopreserved human embryos inadvertently were destroyed at University Hospitals Fertility Clinic in Ohio, and 3,500 eggs and embryos were destroyed when a cryopreservation tank recently malfunctioned at a fertility clinic in California. When reproductive material is lost or destroyed, the aspiring parents; primary harm is emotional; it is non-pecuniary in nature. The emotional harm is particularly extreme in cases where the loss destroys a couple's only hope of becoming parents. Despite the severity of the emotional harm suffered due to the loss, aspiring parents often are left without a clear legal basis to recover emotional disturbance damages. Although emotional disturbance damages are rarely awarded for breach of contract, the article explains why such awards are justified based on the current trend in contract law, as exemplified by Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 353 and posits that clinics and ART professionals are aware at the time of contracting that emotional disturbance is particularly likely in the event of a breach. Scholars have noted that tort damages for emotional harm often are unavailable when reproductive material is lost or destroyed, because the emotional harm is not parasitic to a physical injury, nor can aspiring parents overcome the traditional barriers to NIED recovery because they neither were in the \\"zone of danger\\" nor were they bystanders at the time of loss. Therefore, for aspiring parents who reside in traditional barrier jurisdictions, breach of contract damages may represent their only hope to recover for emotional harm. This article posits that ART clinics and professionals have actual or constructive knowledge of plaintiffs' particular reason for storing reproductive material--namely, to achieve a later pregnancy--at the time of contracting, so as to support consequential damages for emotional disturbance. This knowledge of the contract's purpose, coupled with the nature of the transaction and the surrounding circumstances, put ART clinics and professionals on notice at the time of contracting that emotional disturbance is particularly likely to result from a breach. The article also posits that typical broad, sweeping exculpatory clauses contained in cryopreservation agreements that attempt to negate all liability for freezing and storage of reproductive material, including negligence liability, should not be enforced because such clauses render the agreement illusory and contravene public policy.","output":"Contract Remedies Need Not Undercompensate Aspiring Parents When Cryopreserved Reproductive Material Is Lost or Destroyed: Recovery of Consequential Damages for Emotional Disturbance When Breach of Contract Results in the Lost Opportunity to Become Pregnant with One's Own Biological Child."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we describe a smart and innovative system which provides prime contribution to our society in this pandemic situation.

METHODS: We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days). RESULTS: A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years - range 14-95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p < .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p < .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).

The sizeable disease burden in West Africa, numerous imported LF cases worldwide, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an agent of biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. There are no licensed LASV vaccines and the antiviral treatment is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective. AREAS COVERED LASV vaccine development is hampered by high cost of biocontainment requirement, the absence of appropriate small animal models, genetic diversity of LASV species, and by high HIV-1 prevalence in LASV endemic areas. Over the past 15 years several vaccine platforms have been developed. Natural history of LASV and pathogenesis of the disease provide strong justification for replication-competent (RC) vaccine as one of the most feasible approaches to control LF. Development of LASV vaccine candidates based on reassortant, recombinant, and alphavirus replicon technologies is covered in this review. Expert commentary: Two lead RC vaccine candidates, reassortant ML29 and recombinant VSV/LASV, have been successfully tested in non-human primates and have been recommended by international vaccine experts for rapid clinical development. Both platforms have powerful molecular tools to further secure safety, improve immunogenicity, and cross-protection. These platforms are well positioned to design multivalent vaccines to protect against all LASV strains citculatrd in West Africa.

Despite extensive biochemical studies, full understanding of plant Phy signalling has remained unclear due to the absence of relevant 3D models. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of Arabidopsis PhyB in the Pr state that reveals a topologically complex dimeric organization that is substantially distinct from its prokaryotic relatives. Instead of an anticipated parallel architecture, the C-terminal histidine-kinase-related domains (HKRDs) associate head-to-head, whereas the N-terminal photosensory regions associate head-to-tail to form a parallelogram-shaped platform with near two-fold symmetry. The platform is internally linked by the second of two internal Per/Arnt/Sim domains that binds to the photosensory module of the opposing protomer and a preceding 'modulator' loop that assembles tightly with the photosensory module of its own protomer. Both connections accelerate the thermal reversion of Pfr back to Pr, consistent with an inverse relationship between dimer assembly and Pfr stability. Lopsided contacts between the HKRDs and the platform create profound asymmetry to PhyB that might imbue distinct signalling potentials to the protomers. We propose that this unique structural dynamism creates an extensive photostate-sensitive surface for conformation-dependent interactions between plant Phy photoreceptors and their signalling partners.","output":"Plant phytochrome B is an asymmetric dimer with unique signalling potential."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Cerebral vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbi-mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The aim of this article is to discuss the current status of vasospasm therapy with emphasis on endovascular treatment. METHODS A comprehensive review of the literature obtained by a PubMed search. The most relevant articles related to medical, endovascular and alternative therapies were selected for discussion. RESULTS Current accepted medical options include the oral nimodipine and 'triple-H' therapy (hypertension, hypervolemia and hemodilution). Nimodipine remains the only modality proven to reduce the incidence of infarction. Although widely used, 'triple-H' therapy has not been demonstrated to significantly change overall outcome after cerebral vasospasm. Indeed, both induced hypervolemia and hemodilution may have deleterious effects, and more recent physiologic data favor normovolemia with induced hypertension or optimization of cardiac output. Endovascular options include percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and intra-arterial (IA) infusion of vasodilators. Multiple case reports and case series have been encountered in the literature using different drug regimens with diverse mechanisms of action. Compared with PTA, IA drug infusion has the advantages of distal penetration and a better safety profile. Its main disadvantages are the more frequent need for repeat treatments and its systemic hemodynamic repercussions. Alternative options using intraventricular/cisternal drug therapy and flow augmentation strategies have also shown possible benefits; however, their use is not yet as well established. CONCLUSION Blood pressure or cardiac output optimization should be the mainstay of hyperdynamic therapy. Endovascular treatment appears to have a positive impact on neurological outcome compared with the natural history of the disease. The role of intraventricular therapy and flow augmentation strategies in association with medical and endovascular treatment may, in the future, play a growing role in the management of patients with severe refractory vasospasm.","output":"Current options for the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm: a comprehensive review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototype human acute phase protein, may be causally involved in various human diseases.

The plant-based diet include whole grains (millet, sorghum), legumes (black-eye peas, dry beans, soybean), vegetables, potato, sweet potato, yams, squash, banana, pumpkin seeds, and moringa leaves, and lower consumption of meat. The plant-based diet results in a different gut microbiota than of most of the rest of the world. This has a significant impact on the survival rate of other populations. The \\"plant-based diet\\" results in lower rates of obesity, diabetes and dysbiosis, which could contribute to lower and less severe infections.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the state of transition between the normal aging process and cognitive changes of unformed dementia. Diagnosis and treatment of MCI are the keys to prevent dementia, and hypertension is one of the important influencing factors of MCI. Our preclinical experiment found that Yizhi Qingxin Decoction (YQD) could effectively reduce the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), improve their spatial learning and memory abilities in Morris water maze, and play a neuroprotective role. The objective is to estimate the safety and efficacy of YQD (capsules) in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly with MCI (deficiency of kidney essence syndrome) through this study. METHODS: According to the random number generated by the block random method, 100 participants will be randomly and equally divided into the treatment group (YQD) or the control group (Ginkgo biloba extract tablets). The conversion rate of dementia will be used as the main evaluating indicator by the CDR scale. The MoCA scale, MMSE scale, ADCS-MCI-ADL-24 scale, CGIC-KDS scale, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure will be used as the secondary evaluating indicator. Safety will be evaluated based on specific manifestations of adverse reactions and the incidence of adverse events.

Automatic segmentation of COVID-19 pneumonia lesions is critical for quantitative measurement for diagnosis and treatment management. For this task, deep learning is the state-of-the-art method while requires a large set of accurately annotated images for training, which is difficult to obtain due to limited access to experts and the time-consuming annotation process. To address this problem, we aim to train the segmentation network from imperfect annotations, where the training set consists of a small clean set of accurately annotated images by experts and a large noisy set of inaccurate annotations by non-experts. To avoid the labels with different qualities corrupting the segmentation model, we propose a new approach to train segmentation networks to deal with noisy labels. We introduce a dual-branch network to separately learn from the accurate and noisy annotations. To fully exploit the imperfect annotations as well as suppressing the noise, we design a Divergence-Aware Selective Training (DAST) strategy, where a divergence-aware noisiness score is used to identify severely noisy annotations and slightly noisy annotations. For severely noisy samples we use an unsupervised regularization through dual-branch consistency between predictions from the two branches. We also refine slightly noisy samples and use them as supplementary data for the clean branch to avoid overfitting. Experimental results show that our method achieves a higher performance than standard training process for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation when learning from imperfect labels, and our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art noise-tolerate methods significantly with various clean label percentages.","output":"Learning COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion Segmentation from Imperfect Annotations via Divergence-Aware Selective Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional approaches to antimicrobial drug development are poorly suited to combatting the emergence of novel pathogens.

We modeled total confirmed cases of COVID-19 as the dependent variable with meteorological factors, air pollutants, and their interactions as the independent variables. To account for potential migration effects, we included the migration scale index (MSI) from Wuhan to each of the 120 cities included in the model, using data from 15 Jan. to 18 Mar. 2020. As an important confounding factor, MSI was considered in a negative binomial regression analysis.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests leakage may not always be fraudulent or corrupt, with researchers suggesting medical practitioners may sometimes struggle to understand increasingly complex legal requirements around health financing and billing transactions, which may be improved through education. To explore this phenomenon further, we undertook a scoping review of the literature to identify the medical billing education needs of medical practitioners and whether those needs are being met. METHODS: Eligible records included English language materials published between 1 January 2000 and 4 May 2020. Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, LexisNexis and Heinonline. RESULTS: We identified 74 records as directly relevant to the search criteria. Despite undertaking a comprehensive, English language search, with no country restrictions, studies meeting the inclusion criteria were limited to three countries (Australia, Canada, US), indicating a need for further work internationally. The literature suggests the education needs of medical practitioners in relation to medical billing compliance are not being met and medical practitioners desire more education on this topic. Evidence suggests education may be effective in improving medical billing compliance and reducing waste in health systems. There is broad agreement amongst medical education stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions that medical billing should be viewed as a core competency of medical education, though there is an apparent inertia to include this competency in medical education curricula. Penalties for non-compliant medical billing are serious and medical practitioners are at risk of random audits and investigations for breaches of sometimes incomprehensible, and highly interpretive regulations they may never have been taught. CONCLUSION: Despite acknowledged significance of waste in health systems due to poor practitioner knowledge of billing practices, there has been very little research to date on education interventions to improve health system efficiency at a practitioner level.","output":"Educational needs of medical practitioners about medical billing: a scoping review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Ophthalmologists are inevitably exposed to tears and ocular discharge during ophthalmologic examinations and are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. METHODS: This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). RESULTS: The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0 cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25-0.5 m and 0.5-1.0 m, the count decreased at 50 cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0-2.5 m and &#8805; 2.5 m, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (r = 0.490, P = 0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (r = - 0.675, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols with < 1.0-m diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","output":"Quantitative Evaluation of Aerosol Generation from Non-contact Tonometry and its Correlation with Tear Film Characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many governments across the globe enacted mandatory stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ancient Greek word nostos, meaning homecoming or return, has a commensurate power and mystique. Irish philosopher-poet John Moriarty described it as a teeming word  a haunted word  a word to conjure with. The most celebrated and culturally enduring nostos is that of Homers Odysseus who spent ten years returning home after the fall of Troy. His journey back involved many obstacles, temptations, and fantastical adventures and even a katabasis, a rare descent by the living into the realm of the dead. All the while he was sustained and propelled by his memories of Ithaca (His native home deep imagd in his soul, as Popes translation has it). From Virgils Aeneid to James Joyces Ulysses, from MGMs The Wizard of Oz to the Coen Brothers O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and from Derek Walcotts Omeros to Margaret Atwoods Penelopiad, the Odyssean paradigm of nostos and nostalgia has been continually summoned and reimagined by writers and filmmakers. At the same time, Ithaca has proved to be an evocative and versatile abstraction. It is as much about possibility as it is about the past;it is a vision of Arcadia or a haunting, an object of longing, a repository of memory, a sleep and a forgetting. In essence it is about seeking what is absent. Imagining Ithaca explores the idea of nostos, and its attendant pain (algos), in an excitingly eclectic range of sources: from Rebecca Wests The Return of the Soldier and Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front, through the exilic memoirs of Nabokov and the time-travelling fantasies of Woody Allen, to Seamus Heaneys Virgilian descent into the London Underground and Michael Portillos Telemachan railway journey to Salamanca. This kaleidoscopic exploration spans the end of the Great War, when the world at large was experiencing the complexities of homecoming, to the era of Brexit and COVID-19 which has put the notion of nostalgia firmly under the microscope. ?

Its future and possibilities of achieving set objectives will significantly depend on the economic capacity of countries, their stability and economic development, and their financial security. The IMF acts to benefit its members' financial security, especially in crises, in various manners.

The research methods used herein primarily comprise the analysis of the IMF's documents and the 3SI and analyze statistical data. Findings: The 3SI countries do not have a strong position in the IMF, and stronger possibilities of influencing this institution's policy exist solely due to the countries' membership in the European Union. The IMF engaged financially in the region to a minimal extent since the countries' security was basically ensured. However, it was active by providing support in counseling, technical assistance, and participation in country authorities' reforms.

This study aims to analyze the identity of the text, the ideology of text creation, to the social practices behind the creation of texts on social restriction policies related to COVID-19 in Indonesia. This research uses Norman Fairclough's critical discourse analysis approach. Sources of online media research data containing terms in COVID-19 social restrictions which are considered as discourse texts. Then, informants as academics and the general public have special views related to the term COVID-19 discourse. The data analysis technique used includes the stages of reduction, presentation, and drawing conclusions. The data collection carried out included documentation studies and in-depth interviews in the form of texts in handling COVID-19 and verbally. This study found six texts or discourse terms in handling COVID-19 in Indonesia, namely (1) lockdown, (2) social distancing, (3) physical distancing, (4) regional quarantine, (5) large-scale social restrictions, and (6) civil emergency. The ideology of text creation contained in the practice of discourse includes aspects of text production and consumption. In the production aspect, the text is built as a discourse on preventing COVID-19. The discourse has attracted public resistance as part of the aspect of public consumption. Furthermore, the social practices that underlie the making of social restriction policy texts include economic considerations and political considerations. Economic considerations are how the government maintains its economic legacy, while political considerations are how the government maintains its political image.

We recognize that many decisions are made based on the practical limitations that transplant programs face, especially at the extremes. As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource-constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019: Utilizing an ethical framework for rationing absolutely scarce health-care resources in transplant allocation decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At our institution, 2 of the initial 7 pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 severe infection (28.6%; 95% CI, 8.2%C64.1%) developed cardiac dysfunction with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fractions of 40%C45% and hypokinesis.

We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help. Methods The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis. Results Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), P = 0.0006).

Sheet metal forming is a technology ensuring high strength and light weight of products. Replacing stainless steels with titanium further reduces instrument weight and additionally provides the required resistance to corrosive environments typical for surgeries. The low instrument weight is important to prevent fatigue of surgeons and allow them to maintain high operational accuracy during long term surgeries. The numerical analysis of the technological process was performed in order to adapt it to forming tool handles using titanium sheets instead of steel sheets. The numerical calculations were experimentally verified. It was found that, in the case of titanium handles, it is necessary to use a blank holder in the first forming operation to eliminate sheet wrinkling in the flange area. The shape and dimensional accuracy of the drawn part after trimming were high enough and the 4th forming operation became unnecessary. Moreover, the process modification included lubrication using rapeseed oil with the addition of boric acid, which effectively prevents the galling of titanium on the working surfaces of the steel tools and ensures a more uniform distribution of plastic strains in the drawn part.","output":"Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Titanium Sheet Forming for Medical Instrument Parts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide the details of the successful management of a patient with active Cushing's disease complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The patient was a 27-year-old Japanese female healthcare worker who was scheduled to undergo pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. She had been in close contact with an undiagnosed patient infected with COVID-19 and then developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite a lack of known risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infection, the patient's dyspnea worsened and her respiratory condition deteriorated, as indicated by the need for 7 L/min oxygen supply by mask to maintain her oxygen saturation at >90%. Medical treatment was initiated to control hypercortisolism by the 'block and replace' regimen using steroidogenesis inhibitors and hydrocortisone. The COVID-19 pneumonia improved with multi-modal treatment including antiviral therapy. One month later, after a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with appropriate protection against virus transmission to medical staff in the operating room and daily medical care nurses, trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed by our highly experienced pituitary surgeon. One month after the surgery, the patient's basal ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary free cortisol were all under the detection limit. Surgical remission was expected. Since hypercortisolism due to active Cushing's disease may worsen a COVID-19 infection, multi-disciplinary management that includes appropriate and prompt treatment strategies is mandatory in such cases.","output":"Successful management of a patient with active Cushing's disease complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Eurostat projections indicate that, by 2050, most of the European Union member states will see a fall in their population size, a drop in the share of young people, and a simultaneous rise in the share of elderly persons.

The goal of the study was to assess the stage of advancement and diversity of the ageing of population in the past and in the year 2050. Convergence models were designed for ten variables (indicators for structures by age, demographic dependency, median age) and a synthetic variable characterising the stage of advancement of the ageing of the structures. The occurrence of beta- and sigma-convergence of population structures in EU-27 in the years 2004C2020 and 2020C2050 were verified. The results indicate that absolute beta-convergence of the variables characterising the population structures in the EU countries happened in the past and will happen in around 2050. No unambiguous proof has been found for sigma-convergence, i.e., for any significant decrease over time in the diversity between the countries in terms of the studied variables that characterise the ageing process.

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)Can autoimmune demyelinating inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)Care predominantly treated with immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which can increase the risk of infection. Therefore, there is concern that these patients may be at increased risk of COVID-19. In response to growing concerns of neurologists and patients, this study aimed to determine the prevalence, severity, and possible complications of COVID-19 infection in patients with MS in Saudi Arabia (SA). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients residing in SA with MS who had a positive result for COVID-19 per reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test or viral gene sequencing, using respiratory or plasma samples. Comparison of COVID-19 severity groups was performed using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for numerical variables and Chi- squared test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Seventy patients with MS and COVID-19 (71% female) were included in this analysis. Of the 53 (75.7%) patients taking DMT at the time of COVID-19 infection, the most frequently used drugs were fingolimod (25%) and interferon-beta (25%). Nine (13%) patients had MS relapse and were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone in the four weeks before COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at the peak of COVID-19 infection were fever (46%), fatigue (37%), and headache (36%). The symptoms lasted for a mean duration of 8.7 days; all symptomatic patients recovered and no deaths were reported. COVID-19 severity was categorized in three groups: asymptomatic (n=12), mildCnot requiring hospitalization (n=48), and requiring hospitalization (n=10; two of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit). Between the three groups, comparison of age, body mass index (BMI), Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS), MS disease duration, and DMT use at the time of infection showed no significant differences. A higher percentage of patients who were admitted to hospital or ICU (40%; p=0.026) presented with an MS relapse within the prior four weeks compared with those who were asymptomatic or had a mild infection (both 8.3%). CONCLUSION: These findings present a reassuring picture regarding COVID-19 infection in patients with MS. However, patients with MS who have had a relapse in the preceding four weeks (requiring glucocorticoid treatment) may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19.","output":"Registry of patients with multiple sclerosis and COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amidst climate change, coastal cities in Africa will face serious water and sanitation problems owing to the predicted flooding of coastal land and saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers. For cities such as Mombasa, the problems will be further compounded by high prevalence of informal economies and settlements superimposed on western style governance systems. Yet, right from colonisation to the present day, the water supply and sewage systems have been characterised by a series of inequalities in access. This review paper, discusses the water and sanitation backlogs in the coastal city of Mombasa, tracing them from the colonial times to the post-colonial period. Against this background, we overview the current situation of the water and sanitation sector in the city and discuss possible sustainable interventions. We argue that any analysis of the water and sanitation challenges must consider the motive of the development of the infrastructure during the colonial times. We conclude that sustainable water and sanitation services are likely to remain a mirage unless the issues of funding, cost recovery, data availability and overall governance are fully addressed. A good understanding of both historical inadequacies and current investments would help in designing sustainable interventions going forward.","output":"Motion but no speed: Colonial to post-colonial status of water and sanitation service provision in Mombasa city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In October 2018, President Trump signed into law H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to tertiary and partner hospitals in Saitama, Japan. Twenty-six patients with COVID-19 were categorized into two groups, i.e., older (&#8805;75 years) and younger adults (&#8804;74 years). We evaluated the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory test results, treatments and outcomes of the patients. RESULTS: The majority of the older patients had comorbidities, such as dementia, cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Comorbidities were significantly more frequent in older patients than younger patients. No association was found between age and body temperature or the incidence of respiratory failure. White blood cell count was significantly lower in older patients (P = 0.018) and the decrease in lymphocytes was greater in younger patients (P = 0.009). Computed tomography (CT) of all patients showed non-segmental, peripherally dominant ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. In older patients, antiviral drugs, anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on a compassionate use basis. The difference in mortality between the older and the younger patients was not statistically significant.

Since then, the threat of H5N1 avian influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic have underscored the importance of considering infectious events within such a framework. Pediatric emergency departments (EDs) were disproportionately burdened by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and therefore serve as a robust context for evaluation of pandemic preparedness. The objective of this study was to explore pediatric ED leaders' experiences with preparedness, response, and postincident actions related to the H1N1 pandemic to inform future pandemic and all-hazards planning and policy for EDs. METHODS The authors selected a qualitative design, well suited for exploring complex, multifaceted organizational processes such as planning for and responding to a pandemic and learning from institutional experiences. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit medical directors or their designated physician respondents from pediatric emergency medicine training institutions representing a range of geographic regions across the United States, hospital types, and annual ED volumes; snowball sampling identified additional information-rich respondents. Recruitment began in May 2011 and continued until thematic saturation was reached in January 2012 (n = 20). Data were collected through in-depth individual phone interviews that were recorded and professionally transcribed. Using a standard interview guide, respondents were asked open-ended questions about pandemic planning, response, and institutional learning related to the H1N1 pandemic. Data analysis was performed by a multidisciplinary team using a grounded theory approach to generate themes inductively from respondents' expressed perspectives. The constant comparative method was used to identify emerging themes. RESULTS Five common themes characterized respondents' experiences with pandemic planning and response: 1) national pandemic influenza preparedness guidance has not fully penetrated to the level of pediatric emergency physician (EP) leaders, leading to variable states of preparedness; 2) pediatric EDs that maintained strong relationships with local public health and other health care entities found those relationships to be beneficial to pandemic response; 3) pediatric EP leaders reported difficulty reconciling public health guidance with the reality of ED practice; 4) although many anticipated obstacles did not materialize, in some cases pediatric EP leaders experienced unexpected institutional challenges; and 5) pediatric EP leaders described varied experiences with organizational learning following the H1N1 pandemic experience. CONCLUSIONS Despite a decade of investment in hospital preparedness, gaps in pediatric ED pandemic preparedness remain. This work suggests that raising awareness of pandemic planning standards and promoting strategies to overcome barriers to their adoption could enhance ED and hospital preparedness. Helping hospitals better prepare for pandemic events may lead to strengthened all-hazards preparedness.","output":"Pandemic planning and response in academic pediatric emergency departments during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is a fundamental tool in the public health measures taken to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests worldwide, the availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck and the need to increase testing throughput is rising. We aim to overcome these challenges by pooling samples together, and performing RNA extraction and RT-PCR in pools. METHODS: We tested the efficiency and sensitivity of pooling strategies for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We tested 184 samples both individually and in pools to estimate the effects of pooling. We further implemented Dorfman pooling with a pool size of eight samples in large-scale clinical tests. RESULTS: We demonstrated pooling strategies that increase testing throughput while maintaining high sensitivity. A comparison of 184 samples tested individually and in pools of eight samples showed that test results were not significantly affected. Implementing the eight-sample Dorfman pooling to test 26 576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we identified 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput.

Because immunization is an essential health service, modeling changes in SARS-CoV-2 infections among communities and health workers due to different vaccination activities was undertaken to understand the risks and to inform approaches to resume services. Methods: Agent-based modeling examined the impact of Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) delivery strategies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in communities and health workers for six countries capturing various demographic profiles and health system performance: Angola, Ecuador, Lao PDR, Nepal, Pakistan, and Ukraine. Results: Urban, fixed-post SIAs during periods of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence increased infections within the community by around 28 [range:0-79] per 1000 vaccinations. House-to-house SIAs in mixed urban and rural contexts may import infections into previously na?ve communities.

We describe the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and characteristics of COVID-19 cases and clusters before the characterisation of COVID-19 as a pandemic. METHODS: Cases of COVID-19 reported between Dec 31, 2019, and March 10, 2020 (ie, the prepandemic period), were identified daily from official websites, press releases, press conference transcripts, and social media feeds of national ministries of health or other government agencies. Case characteristics, travel history, and exposures to other cases were abstracted. Countries with at least one case were classified as affected. Early cases were defined as those among the first 100 cases reported from each country. Later cases were defined as those after the first 100 cases. We analysed reported travel to affected countries among the first case reported from each country outside mainland China, demographic and exposure characteristics among cases with age or sex information, and cluster frequencies and sizes by transmission settings. FINDINGS: Among the first case reported from each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries; 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran. Among 1200 cases with age or sex information, 874 (73%) were early cases. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35C63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Overall, 21 (2%) of 1200 cases were in health-care workers and none were in pregnant women. 101 clusters were identified, of which the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 26 cases per cluster [range 2C7]), followed by non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 43 cases per cluster [2C14]), and community gatherings (11 [11%]; mean 142 cases per cluster [4C36]). INTERPRETATION: Cases with travel links to China, Italy, or Iran accounted for almost two-thirds of the first reported COVID-19 cases from affected countries. Among cases with age information available, most were among adults aged 18 years and older. Although there were many clusters of household transmission among early cases, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be larger, supporting a possible role for physical distancing to slow the progression of SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) are a critical source of adipocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cell fate determination and differentiation. The objective of the present study was to identify and investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs on adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs. METHODS We used lncRNA arrays to identify the prominent differentially expressed lncRNAs before and after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and verified their biological function through antisense oligonucleotide knockdown or lentivirus overexpression. The adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs was assessed by oil red O staining as well as the mRNA and protein levels of adipogenic marker genes through qRT-PCR and western blot. Bioinformatic tool LncPro and immunofluorescence was performed to uncover the interaction between lnc13728 and ZBED3. WNT/-catenin signaling pathway was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS The lncRNA arrays showed that lnc13728 expression was significantly upregulated after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and was correlated positively with the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes in human adipose tissue. Lnc13728 knockdown in hADSCs suppressed the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes at both mRNA and protein level and weakened lipid droplet production. Accordingly, lnc13728 overexpression enhanced hADSC adipogenic differentiation. Beyond that, lnc13728 co-localized with ZBED3 in the cytoplasm and regulated its expression positively. Downregulating ZBED3 had a negative effect on adipogenic differentiation, while the expression of WNT/-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins was upregulated. CONCLUSIONS Lnc13728 promotes hADSC adipogenic differentiation possibly by positively regulating the expression of ZBED3 which plays a role in inhibiting the WNT/-catenin pathway.","output":"Lnc13728 facilitates human mesenchymal stem cell adipogenic differentiation via positive regulation of ZBED3 and downregulation of the WNT/-catenin pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online teaching is a reality and a necessity especially since the appearance of the COVID-19 outbreak In order to facilitate the proper conduct of this process, several steps are required: to have in place a secure infrastructure to store data and to handle the data flow, to manage the student and teacher information, and to facilitate the teacher-student communication so students have access to courses and teachers can properly evaluate the students This paper presents a distributed architecture for identity management of university students and teachers, while considering aspects pertaining to user privacy and security Also, a solution is proposed for easy integration with third-party solutions that facilitate online teaching and learning, i e , Microsoft Office 365, Google G Suite and the Moodle educational platform, and access to the university's Wi-Fi network with the same credentials The implementation of the solution at the \\"Gheorghe Asachi\\"Technical University of Iasi, Romania allowed classes to be carried out online and students to be evaluated also online ? 2020 IEEE","output":"An architecture of identity management and thirdparty integration for online teaching in a university"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Early reversal of hypoxia through ventilations is the most effective measure to reduce mortality for the drowned person In the COVID-19 era, there is a movement away from this intervention for out-of-hospital providers as resuscitation organisations update protocols and individuals become concerned about potential risk Aquatic rescuers face a dilemma and as a result, required updated guidance Methods: Three international organisations representing aquatic rescuers requested input from their membership and a working group was formed to draft the statement Elements were identified from the responses and for each, three features were discussed: recommendations for rescuers, interventions to improve safety, and data needed to inform practices Consensus was achieved through an iterative process whereby an updated statement was sent to the larger membership for feedback until no major revisions were identified Results: 56 individuals with expertise in drowning resuscitation research, policy and implementation contributed from 17 countries Eight elements were highlighted, which included development of a COVID-19 drowning resuscitation algorithm (Fig 1), and strategies for risk mitigation, protective equipment, education and research Data gaps identified included the rescuer's risk of becoming infected, efficacy of alternative ventilation techniques and ability of organisations to urgently implement new training programmes [Formula presented] The process highlighted global differences in rescuer knowledge, skill and access to equipment which were exacerbated by region-specific pandemic concerns Despite these, agreement was reached by generating recommendations with levels of risk that were aimed towards organisations instead of the individual rescuer Conclusion: We describe the first urgent, global consensus process by the drowning community Through this, a resuscitation algorithm for use by aquatic organisations has been developed describing adaptations in the COVID-19 era Although the viral threat may subside in the future, the consensus process has revealed important insights to improve the safety of rescuers who perform resuscitation in aquatic environments","output":"Resuscitation of the drowned person in the era of COVID-19 disease: Global consensus process for a novel approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases and timely initiation of appropriate treatment are critical determinants that promote optimal clinical outcomes and general public health.

METHODS: National survey data were obtained from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project, an ongoing cross-sectional weekly survey. The sample was provided by Lucid, a web-based market research platform. Three outcomes were evaluated: (1) COVID-19-related concerns, (2) precautionary behaviors, and (3) willingness to return to activity. Key independent variables included age, gender, race or ethnicity, education, household income, political party support, religion, news consumption, number of medication prescriptions, perceived COVID-19 status, and timing of peak COVID-19 infections by state. RESULTS: The data included 125,508 responses from web-based surveys conducted over 20 consecutive weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (comprising approximately 6250 adults per week), between March 19 and August 5, 2020, approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Institutional Review Board for analysis.

Evidence of how this health crisis affected common conditions like blood pressure (BP) control is uncertain. METHODS: We used longitudinal BP data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial to examine variations in home BP monitored via a smartphone-based application (app) in a total of 7394 elderly patients with hypertension aged 60 to 80 years stratified by their location in Wuhan (n=283) compared with other provinces of China (n=7111). Change in morning systolic BP (SBP) was analyzed for 5 30-day phases during the pandemic, including preepidemic (October 21 to November 20, 2019), incubation (November 21 to December 20, 2019), developing (December 21, 2019 to January 20, 2020), outbreak (January 21 to February 20, 2020), and plateau (February 21 to March 21, 2020). RESULTS: Compared with non-Wuhan areas of China, average morning SBP (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index) in Wuhan patients was significantly higher during the epidemic growth phases, which returned to normal at the plateau. Between-group differences in &#916;SBP were +2.5, +3.0, and +2.1 mm Hg at the incubation, developing, and outbreak phases of COVID-19 (P<0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed a similar trend in trajectory pattern of SBP in both the intensive and standard BP control groups of the trial. Patients in Wuhan also had an increased regimen change in antihypertensive drugs during the outbreak compared with non-Wuhan patients. Expectedly, Wuhan patients were more likely to check their BP via the app, while doctors were less likely to monitor the app for BP control during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a short-term increase in morning SBP among elderly patients with hypertension in Wuhan but not other parts of China.

As a result, the UK National Screening Committee does not recommend systematic population screening of dementia, although case-finding strategies are still applied for high-risk groups. METHODS: This study added additional evidence of the effectiveness of the National Dementia Strategy and increased numbers of diagnosis of dementia on the younger cohorts of the older people, using the intrinsic estimator age-period-cohort (APC) models and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing data. RESULTS: Age effects show that diagnosis increases in volume only among those aged 75 and above, suggesting that many of those aged below 75 might not be diagnosed in time. Period effects show that although there was an initial increase due to the new policy implementation, the trend stalled in later years, indicating that the increase might not have been even across the period when controlled for age and cohort. The study also shows that cohort effects indicate lower prevalence in younger cohorts controlled for age and period effects.

Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas.

Moreover, since general anesthesia is an aerosol-generating procedure, its use became controversial. This strongly restricted therapeutic strategies. Here, we report a series of undeferrable surgical cases treated with awake surgery under neuraxial anesthesia. Contextual benefits of this approach are deepened. Methods: During the first pandemic surge, thirteen patients (5 men and 8 women) with a mean age of 80 years, needing undelayable surgery due to abdominal emergencies, underwent awake open surgery at our Hospital. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 diagnosis. In all cases, regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain intensities have been monitored and regularly assessed. A distinct pathway has been set up to keep patients of uncertain COVID-19 diagnosis separated from all other patients. Postoperative course has been examined. Results: The mean operative time was 87 minutes (minimum 60 minutes; maximum 165 minutes). In one case, conversion to general anesthesia was necessary. Postoperative pain was always well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. No perioperative major complications (Clavien-Dindo &#8805;3) occurred. Early readmission after surgery never occurred.

METHODS: A single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included in this study. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and AI-assisted chest CT imaging variables identified on hospital admission were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to develop a model for predicting the AKI risk. The accuracy of the AKI prediction model was measured using the concordance index (C-index), and the internal validity of the model was assessed by bootstrap resampling. A multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for survival analysis in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four patients were included. The median (SD) age of the patients was 63.59  13.79 years, and 83 (47.7%) were men.u-NGAL, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and CT ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume were independent predictors of AKI, and all were selected in the nomogram. The prediction model was validated by internal bootstrapping resampling, showing results similar to those obtained from the original samples (i.e., 0.958; 95% CI 0.9097C0.9864). The C-index for predicting AKI was 0.955 (95% CI 0.916C0.995). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed that a high u-NGAL level, an increased GGO volume, and lymphopenia are strong predictors of a poor prognosis and a high risk of in-hospital death.

We can attain the locomotion procedure of the robot using the principle of Radio-frequency identification (RFID) that automatically identifies and tracks tags attached to the objects. The movement and finding the path to patient location is done through a line follower and with RFID tag. Line following method is used to identify the path with help of two infrared sensors. The robot will move towards the patient's room by following a non reflective line and use RFID cards to identify the patient's room number. Using the vending machine the medicine delivery is made possible to the patients. All the measured parameters will be stored to the cloud using the application of the Internet of Thinking (IoT). All the data will successfully be sent to the cloud through the Node MCU. If the read values varied from threshold then a message will be sent to doctors through GSM Module. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"MedRobo Medicine Delivering and Patient Parameter Monitoring Robot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Objective: To investigate sociodemographic factors associated with the willingness to take the pandemic influenza vaccine.

Results: Among 2,828 participants, 15.9% would not be willing to vaccinate in the future if the Brazilian Ministry of Health promoted a new vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged &gt; 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination.

STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA English language studies that investigated pre-arrest and intra-arrest prognostic factors and survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest. DATA EXTRACTION PROGRESS (prognosis research strategy group) recommendations and the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist were followed. Risk of bias was assessed by using the QUIPS tool (quality in prognosis studies). The primary analysis pooled associations only if they were adjusted for relevant confounders. The GRADE approach (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) was used to rate certainty in the evidence. RESULTS The primary analysis included 23 cohort studies. Of the pre-arrest factors, male sex (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.95, moderate certainty), age 60 or older (0.50, 0.40 to 0.62, low certainty), active malignancy (0.57, 0.45 to 0.71, high certainty), and history of chronic kidney disease (0.56, 0.40 to 0.78, high certainty) were associated with reduced odds of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Poly-ubiquitinated protein aggregates increase in the flight muscles as flies age, which are reduced in response to minocycline feeding. Minocycline feeding increases the expression of several autophagy genes and the activity of the autophagy/lysosomal pathway in Drosophila muscles. Interestingly, mutant flies lacking either FOXO or Hsp70 showed increased levels of poly-ubiquitinated protein aggregates with reduced autophagy/lysosomal activity, which was not reversed by minocycline feeding.

METHODS: We conducted a grounded theory based on the experience of 24 clinical psychologists who provided extensive support to the population during the pandemic in different Italian regions. Three online focus groups were conducted. The transcripts of the focus groups were analyzed through a process of open, axial, and selective coding. Data collection terminated once thematic saturation was reached. RESULTS: Repositioning emerged as the evolutionary task people were confronted with in the face of a New Reality. Repositioning meant dealing with and integrating unpleasant Emotional Experiences deriving from the lockdown and reopening (i.e., unsafety, emotional exhaustion, loneliness, uncertainty, loss, and disconnection) through different Coping Strategies. Repositioning was facilitated or hindered by contextual and individual Intervening Conditions and led to two Adjustment Outcomes: growth or block.

However, thresholds are not uniform across all analysis methods due to dependencies on patient demographics and computational algorithms. This study aimed to investigate optimal perfusion thresholds for quantifying infarct and penumbra volumes using two post-processing CTP algorithms: Vitrea Bayesian and singular value decomposition plus (SVD+). We utilized 107 AIS patients (67 non-intervention patients and 40 successful reperfusion of thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (2b/3) patients). Infarct volumes were predicted for both post-processing algorithms through contralateral hemisphere comparisons using absolute time-to-peak (TTP) and relative regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) thresholds ranging from +2.8 seconds to +9.3 seconds and -0.23 to -0.56 respectively. Optimal thresholds were determined by minimizing differences between predicted CTP and 24-hour fluid-attenuation inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging infarct. Optimal thresholds were tested on 60 validation patients (30 intervention and 30 non-intervention) and compared using RAPID CTP software. Among the 67 non-intervention and 40 intervention patients, the following optimal thresholds were determined: intervention Bayesian: TTP = +4.8 seconds, rCBV = -0.29; intervention SVD+: TTP = +5.8 seconds, rCBV = -0.29; non-intervention Bayesian: TTP = +5.3 seconds, rCBV = -0.32; non-intervention SVD+: TTP = +6.3 seconds, rCBV = -0.26. When comparing SVD+ and Bayesian post-processing algorithms, optimal thresholds for TTP were significantly different for intervention and non-intervention patients. rCBV optimal thresholds were equal for intervention patients and significantly different for non-intervention patients.

The medical management of PCF has included the use of octreotide without a well-defined understanding of its therapeutic mechanism. We hypothesized that octreotide induces alterations in the saliva proteome and that these alterations may provide insight into the mechanism of action underlying improved PCF healing. We undertook an exploratory pilot study in healthy controls that involved collecting saliva before and after a subcutaneous injection of octreotide and performing proteomic analysis to determine the effects of octreotide. Materials and Methods: Four healthy adult participants provided saliva samples before and after subcutaneous injection of octreotide. A mass-spectrometry based workflow optimized for the quantitative proteomic analysis of biofluids was then employed to analyze changes in salivary protein abundance after octreotide administration. Results: There were 3,076 human, 332 S. mitis, 102 G. haemolyans and 42 G. adiacens protein groups quantified in saliva samples. A paired statistical analysis was performed using the generalized linear model (glm) function in edgeR. There were and ~300 proteins that had a p<0.05 between the pre- and post-octreotide groups ~50 proteins with an FDR-corrected p<0.05 between pre- and post-groups. These results were visualized using a volcano plot after filtering on proteins quantified by 2 more or unique precursors. Both human and bacterial proteins were among the proteins altered by octreotide treatment. Notably, four isoforms of the human cystatins, belonging to a family of cysteine proteases, that had significantly lower abundance after treatment. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated octreotide-induced downregulation of cystatins. By downregulation of cystatins in the saliva, there is decreased inhibition of cysteine proteases such as Cathepsin S. This results in increased cysteine protease activity that has been linked to enhanced angiogenic response, cell proliferation and migration that have resulted in improved wound healing.

Within this context, this review found that, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the risk of hospitalization in children and adults increased, especially in patients with a history of complications such as acute chest syndrome. In addition, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic appears to have less repercussion among children with hemoglobinopathies compared to adults, similar to what is seen in the general population. In the H1N1 pandemic, patients with hemoglobinopathies behaved as a group more susceptible to complications, with increased morbidity and mortality.

In nasopharyngeal specimens, the sensitivity/specificity of the pool-testing approach, with 5 and 10 specimens per pool, were 77%/100% (n=105) and 74.1%/100% (n=260) by QIAstat, and 97.1%/100% (n=250) and 100%/99.5% (n=200) by Xpert, respectively. Pool-testing of saliva (10 specimens per pool;n=150) by Xpert resulted in 87.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity compared to individual tests. Pool size of 5 or 10 specimens did not significantly affect the difference of RT-qPCR cycle threshold (C T ) values from standard testing. RT-qPCR C T values obtained with pool testing by both QIAstat or Xpert were positively correlated with that of individual testing (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.85 to 0.99, p <0.05).

Data on patient demographic characteristics, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes was analyzed. A nomogram was constructed to predict the death probability of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and C-reactive protein obtained on admission were identified as predictors of mortality for COVID-19 patients by LASSO. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.921 and 0.975 for the derivation and validation cohort, respectively. An integrated score (named ANDC) with its corresponding death probability was derived. Using ANDC cut-off values of 59 and 101, COVID-19 patients were classified into three subgroups.

Previous studies have shown that Eap binds with nanomolar affinity to complement component C4b and prevents C4b binding the pro-protease, C2, thereby inhibiting formation of the pro-C3 convertase shared by the classical and lectin pathways (Woehl et al. in J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014). The C4b-binding and complement-inhibitory properties of Eap from S. aureus strain Mu50 lie within the two C terminal-most Eap domains (i.e. Eap34) (Woehl et al. J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014).

There is no evidence suggesting that wide margin excisions decrease intra-breast tumour recurrence. Various perioperative techniques are used for margin assessment. We aimed to compare three commonly used techniques, i.e., Ultrasound-guided surgery, palpation-guided surgery and cavity shaving for attaining negative margins and estimating the extent of healthy breast tissue resection. METHOD A prospective comparative study was performed on 90 patients who underwent breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer between August 2018 and June 2019. Tumour excision with a minimum of 1 cm margin was done either using ultrasound, palpation or cavity shaving. Histopathological evaluation was done to assess the margin status and excess amount of resected normal breast tissue. Calculated resection ratio (CRR) defining the excess amount of the resected breast tissue was achieved by dividing the total resection volume (TRV) by optimal resection volume (ORV). The time taken for excision was also recorded. RESULTS Histopathology of all 90 patients (30 in each group) revealed a negative resection margin in 93.3% of 30 patients in palpation-guided surgery group and 100% in both Ultrasound-guided surgery and cavity shaving groups. Two patients (6.7%) from the cavity shaving group had positive margins on initial lumpectomy but shave margins were negative. TRV was significantly less in the Ultrasound-guided surgery group compared to the palpation-guided surgery group and cavity shaving group (76.9 cm3, 94.7 cm3 and 126.3 cm3 respectively; p < 0.0051). CRR was 1.2 in ultrasound group compared to 1.9 in palpation group and 2.1 in cavity shave group which was also statistically significant (p < 0.0001).Excision time was significantly less (p < 0.001) in palpation-guided surgery group (13.8 min) compared to cavity shaving group (15.1 min) and Ultrasound-guided group (19.4 min).

It was thus anticipated that drugs modulating the RAS including an upregulation of ACE2 may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Since the use of RAS-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, represents the backbone of recommended antihypertensive therapy and intense debate about their use in the COVID-19 pandemic has developed. Currently, a direct role of hypertension, independent of age and other comorbidities, as a risk factor for the SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, particularly death, has not been established. Similarly, both current experimental and clinical studies do not support an unfavorable effect of RAS-blockers or other classes of first line blood pressure lowering drugs in COVID-19. Here, we review available data on the role of hypertension and its management on COVID-19. Conversely, some aspects as to how the COVID-19 affects hypertension management and impacts on future developments are also briefly discussed. COVID-19 has and continues to proof the critical importance of hypertension research to address questions that are important for global health.","output":"Hypertension, a Moving Target in COVID-19: Current Views and Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two dimensional molecular tagging velocimetry (2D-MTV) has been used to measure velocity fields of the flow in a micro mixer. Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of PIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol.","output":"Micro-flow analysis by molecular tagging velocimetry and planar Raman-scattering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the great crises of the COVID-19 coronavirus, virtually all new technologies protected by patent rights have been used in practice from diagnostics, therapeutic, medical equipment, and vaccine to prevention, tracking, and containment of COVID-19. However, the moral justification of patent rights is questioned when pharmaceutical patents conflict with public health. This paper proposes a revised approach of deciding on how to address the conflicts between business ethics and patent protections and then compares the different mechanisms of clearing patent thickets. Our findings highlight that patent pledges may not only contribute to achieving the maximized substantive justice of the public but also help patent pledgors fulfill procedural justice. The advantages of patent pledges have attracted many patent holders to make public statements during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, the disadvantages of a free license may make patent pledges not sustainable for a long time without the related supporting measures.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on admission rates to the delivery room and the feto-maternal unit, and to assess the effect on the nature of presenting obstetrical complaints to the emergency department. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study in one medical center. The population was women > 20 weeks pregnant who presented to the obstetrical emergency department with self-complaints during 29 days at the peak of the pandemic outbreak, and a matched group during the exact period in the previous year. We compared between the groups: clinical, obstetrical, and demographic data, including age, area of residence, gravidity, parity, previous cesarean deliveries, high-risk pregnancy follow-up, the last 30 days admissions to the obstetrical emergency department, gestational age, chief complaints, cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, admissions to the delivery room or feto-maternal unit, time from admissions to the delivery room to birth, if applicable, and acute obstetrical complications diagnosed at the emergency department. RESULTS: During the pandemic outbreak, 398 women met study inclusion criteria, compared to 544 women in the matched period of the previous year. During the COVID-19 period, women visited the obstetrical emergency department at a more advanced mean gestational age (37.6  3.7 vs. 36.7  4.6, p = .001). Higher proportions of women in the COVID-19 cohort presented in active labor, defined by cervical dilation of at least 5 cm on admission to the labor ward [37 (9.3%) vs 28 (5.1%), p = .013)] and with premature rupture of membranes [82 (20.6%) vs 60 (11.0%), p < .001)], and consequently with more admissions to the delivery room [198 (49.7%) vs 189 (34.7%), p < .001)]. We also recorded a significant increase in urgent obstetrical events in the emergency department during the recorded COVID-19 pandemic [23 (5.8%) vs 12 (2.2%)), p = .004]. However, the rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity did not change. During the outbreak the proportion of visits during the night was higher than during the matched period of the previous year: [138 (34.7%) vs 145 (26.6%)), p = .008]. In a multivariate logistic regression, the higher rates of admission to the delivery room during active labor and of urgent events during the pandemic outbreak compared to the matched period in the previous year remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 caused a behavioral change among women who presented to the obstetrical emergency department. This was characterized by delayed arrival to the obstetrical emergency department and the delivery room, which led to a significant increase in urgent and acute interventions. The change in behavior did not affect the rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity.","output":"Changes in the obstetrical emergency department profile during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is quickly spreading across China and globally.

As a result of this, the hydrophilic glutamic acid residue is replaced by hydrophobic valine residue, leading to the formation of hemoglobin tetramer HBS. This alteration in the beta-globin chain makes the red blood cells prone to sickling, especially in the presence of risk factors such as stress, hypoxia, and infection. These sickled red blood cells have the tendency to adhere to the endothelium and lead to vessel occlusion and distal tissue ischemia. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has impacted millions across the globe, putting individuals with co-morbidities at particularly high risk, and patients with sickle cell disease are no exception. We present the case of a 47-year-old African American male presenting to the emergency department with subjective fevers and a two-day history of pain in the arms, legs, and chest. A diagnosed case of sickle cell disease, the patient was on hydromorphone for pain management but ran out of his medications a few weeks before presentation. On examination, the patient was saturating well with mild tenderness upon palpation of the arms, legs, and chest. On complete blood count, the patient had a hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL and a white cell count of 13.1 x10(3)/mcL. The patient had a normal mean corpuscular volume with reticulocytosis, hypochromia, ovalocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromasia, and target cells. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. The chest X-ray did not reveal any significant findings. He was admitted to the medicine floor for the management of sickle cell crisis and was placed under airborne and droplet precautions. The patient was started on hydromorphone for pain management and intravenous fluid hydration. On the second day of admission, the patient reported increasing shortness of breath. He was saturating 90% on room air and 94% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. The white blood cell count increased to 18.42 x10(3)/mcL and the chest X-ray revealed reticular densities with patchy alveolar opacities in the left lung. Given the decline in respiratory status, the patient was started on remdesivir. Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient's pain and respiratory status improved, with the patient saturating 97% on room air. He was discharged home with instructions to follow isolation precautions for at least two weeks, folic acid, and adequate pain management.

Reducing human interaction is the most important health measure to avoid the spread of the infection. In this context, leveraging IoT and cloud-based technology help to remedy COVID-19 consequences by means of enabling individuals to manage their essential activities remotely with minimum engagement. However, sharing and gathering sensitive information over public insecure channel brings enormous security risks. To avoid these risks, we present a new practical lightweight multi-factor authentication and authorization scheme for real-time data access in IoT cloud-based environment, called LMAAS-IoT. Our scheme is suitable for, but not limited to, managing large scale systems such as health infrastructures. LMAAS-IoT is secure, efficient and strengthens user anonymity using dynamic index. Our design supports high scalability systems with efficient user registration process in which the legitimate user can access current as well as newly added system entities without further processes. We employed one-way cryptographic hash functions along with bitwise XOR operations. In addition, a fuzzy extractor algorithm is used at user side to verify users biometric information. LMAAS-IoT is analyzed for security with the help of the widely used Real-Or-Random (ROR) model;proof of correctness using BAN-logic;formal security verification using the broadly accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool as well as the informal security analysis.

We used random-effect or fixed-effect models to obtain pooled estimates. RESULTS: A total of 7 publications, including 665 patients (ALMT 296 and MS 369), were included. Age (WMD: 1.80 years, 95% CI 0.31C3.29), weight (WMD: ? 0.91 kg, 95% CI ? 5.57 to 3.75), sex distribution (OR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.74C1.35) and surgical type (patch or direct closure) (OR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.67C1.49) were comparable in the ALMT group and MS group. No significant differences in the success rate (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05C1.07) or severe complication rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 0.41C5.22) were found between the ALMT group and the MS group. In addition, the differences in the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (WMD 6.33; 95% CI ? 1.92 to 14.58 min, p = 0.13) and the operation time (WMD 5.23; 95% CI ? 12.49 to 22.96 min, p = 0.56) between the ALMT group and the MS group were not statistically significant. However, the ALMT group had a significantly longer aortic cross-clamp time (2.37 min more, 95% CI 1.07C3.67 min, p = 0.0003). The intubation time was 1.82 h shorter (95% CI ? 3.10 to ? 0.55 h; p = 0.005), the intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 0.24 days shorter (95% CI ? 0.44 to ? 0.04 days; p = 0.02), and the postoperative hospital stay was 2.45 days shorter (95% CI ? 3.01 to ? 1.88 days; p < 0.00001) in the ALMT group than in the MS group.

AUD affects nearly one-third of adults at some point during their lives, with an associated cost of approximately $249 billion annually in the U.S. alone. The effects of alcohol consumption are expected to increase significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with alcohol sales increased by approximately 54%, potentially exacerbating health concerns and risk-taking behaviors. Unfortunately, existing pharmacological and behavioral therapies for AUD have historically been associated with poor success rates, with approximately 40% of individuals relapsing within three years of treatment. Pre-clinical studies have shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to significant changes in synaptic function within the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), one of the brain regions associated with AUD and responsible for mediating goal-directed behavior. Specifically, chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with hyperactivity of dopamine receptor 1 (D1) medium spiny neurons (MSN) and hypoactivity of dopamine receptor 2 (D1) MSNs within the DMS. Optogenetic, chemogenetic, and transgenic approaches have demonstrated that reducing the D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalance decreases alcohol self-administration in rodent models of AUD. However, these approaches cannot be studied clinically at this time. Here, we present an electrical stimulation alternative that uses ultra-low (<=1Hz) frequency (ULF) spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to reduce DMS D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalances by stimulating D1-MSN afferents into the GPi and ACC glutamatergic projections to the DMS in a time-locked stimulation sequence. Our data suggest that GPi/ACC ULF-STDP selectively decreases DMS D1-MSN hyperactivity leading to reduced alcohol consumption without evoking undesired affective behaviors in a two-bottle choice mouse model of AUD.","output":"An ultra-low frequency spike timing dependent plasticity-based approach for treating alcohol use disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems around the world.

Compared with COVID-19, CAP was characterized by elevated baseline white cell count (WCC) [median 12.48 (IQR 8.2C15.3) versus 6.78 (IQR 5.2C9.5) 10(6) cells/mL, P < 0.0001], C-reactive protein (CRP) [median 133.5 (IQR 65C221) versus 86.0 (IQR 42C160) mg/L, P < 0.0001], and greater reduction in CRP 48C72 h into admission [median CRP ?33 (IQR ?112 to +3.5) versus +14 (IQR ?15.5 to +70.5) mg/L, P < 0.0001]. These observations were recapitulated in the independent validation cohort at BH (169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients). A multivariate logistic regression model incorporating WCC and CRP discriminated CAP from COVID-19 with AUC 0.88 (95% CI 0.83C0.94). Baseline WCC >8.2  10(6) cells/mL or falling CRP identified 94% of CAP cases, and excluded bacterial co-infection in 46% of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that in COVID-19, absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.","output":"Exclusion of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 using baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in shifts in college education and subsequently peer sexuality education for college students.

EAV particles contain seven structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein N, the unglycosylated envelope proteins M and E, and the N-glycosylated membrane proteins GP(2b) (previously named G(S)), GP(3), GP(4), and GP(5) (previously named G(L)). Proteins N, M, and GP(5) are major virion components, E occurs in virus particles in intermediate amounts, and GP(4), GP(3), and GP(2b) are minor structural proteins. The M and GP(5) proteins occur in virus particles as disulfide-linked heterodimers while the GP(4), GP(3), and GP(2b) proteins are incorporated into virions as a heterotrimeric complex. Here, we studied the effect on virus assembly of inactivating the structural protein genes one by one in the context of a (full-length) EAV cDNA clone. It appeared that the three major structural proteins are essential for particle formation, while the other four virion proteins are dispensable. When one of the GP(2b), GP(3), or GP(4) proteins was missing, the incorporation of the remaining two minor envelope glycoproteins was completely blocked while that of the E protein was greatly reduced. The absence of E entirely prevented the incorporation of the GP(2b), GP(3), and GP(4) proteins into viral particles. EAV particles lacking GP(2b), GP(3), GP(4), and E did not markedly differ from wild-type virions in buoyant density, major structural protein composition, electron microscopic appearance, and genomic RNA content. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the EAV particle in which the GP(2b)/GP(3)/GP(4) heterotrimers are positioned, in association with a defined number of E molecules, above the vertices of the putatively icosahedral nucleocapsid.","output":"Structural protein requirements in equine arteritis virus assembly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are taken as the first treatment option for hypertensive patients. The various global trials have suggested that ACEIs and ARBs may increase risk of lung cancer; however, the results are contradictory and there is no local study available. This study is conducted to compare the incidence of lung cancers in patients on ACEIs and ARBs. Methods: This retrospective study, conducted in a major cardiology unit of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, included patients diagnosed with hypertension, between 2005 and 2010, who were prescribed either ACEIs or ARBs. During the period of 2005 to 2010, 47,823 na?ve hypertensive patients were reported in the outpatient department of the cardiology unit. Of which, 22,241 were prescribed ACEI and 25,582 were prescribed ARBs. After sorting patient data based on our inclusion criteria, n = 14,891 participants were included in the ACEI group and n = 19,112 participants were included in the ARB group. Results: The incidence of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB group was n = 165 and n = 160, respectively. In this study, the overall incidence rates of lung cancer in the ACEI and ARB cohorts were 12.2 and 16.6 per 10,000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.64; p-value: 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, the incidence of lung cancer was relatively more among people using ACEIs than ARBs. Hence, patients undergoing long-term treatment with ACEIs need regular follow-up and proper scanning to avoid grave complications.","output":"Comparison Between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for Incidence of Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis.

This implies that astronauts would remain exposed for long time to a micro-gravity environment with limited medical support available. This has sparkled medical research to investigate how tissues may adapt to such conditions and how wound repair may be influenced. This mini-review is focused on the effects of microgravity and unloading conditions on the epidermis and its keratinocytes. Previous studies, originally aimed at improving the in vitro protocols to generate skin substitutes for plastic surgery purposes, showed that epidermal stem cells cultured in simulated microgravity underwent enhanced proliferation and viability and reduced terminal differentiation than under normal gravity. In the meantime, microgravity also triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition of keratinocytes, promoting a migratory behavior. The molecular mechanisms, only partially understood, involve mechano-trasduction signals and pathways whereby specific target genes are activated, i.e., those presiding to circadian rhythms, migration, and immune suppression, or inhibited, i.e., those involved in stress responses. However, despite the above in vitro studies suggest that microgravity would accelerate keratinocyte growth rate and migration, in vivo findings on animals in experimental set-ups to simulate low gravity rather suggest that prolonged mechanical unloading contributes to delayed and impaired epidermal repair. This is in keeping with the finding that microgravity interferes at multiple levels with the regulatory signals which coordinate the different cell types involved in the repair process, thereby negatively influencing skin wound healing.","output":"The Epidermis in Microgravity and Unloading Conditions and Their Effects on Wound Healing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned his Communist Party comrades to be prepared for unforeseen incidents (black swans) and uncontrollable rampages (gray rhinos) in the year to come","output":"What is cohort marketing and why is it needed now?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 marks one of the most challenging year in human history with unprecedented globalization challenges However, there is a silver lining in the midst of such challenges in that it invigorated intensive and unlimited academic cooperation at grass-roots level between the worlds two most ancient civilizations, India and China It was a year of 1st Indo-China Research Webinar Series featuring over 5000 participants, 16 technical sessions and 10 Special Guests Under normal circumstances, this clearly would not be possible After all, generally, it would have required at least a year of detailed planning coupled with significant funding The success of the series stood on the foundation of the past several years of scientific collaborations This chapter describes this scientific cooperation in terms of youth exchange (2-way) between outstanding universities from both countries In addition, the impact of such cooperation in terms of Joint International Research Awards has also been presented Still, what is presented here is still only the tip of iceberg of the impact of scientific cooperation between the youth of both countries in past few years Undoubtedly, a great deal still needs to be done to further deepen relations in people to people exchange at the scientific level between both countries, especially in seeking solutions to scientific issues of mutual interest, especially in the global existential challenges of climate change and the economic future of sustainable infrastructure development for humanity ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"India and China Scientific Collaborations at Grass-Root Level: A New Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one kind of non-coding RNA, play vital role in regulating several physiological and developmental processes.

Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The importance of the timing of quarantine measures before symptom onset to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks - illustrated by Hong Kong's intervention model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Desmodus rotundus is one of the hematophagous bat species that are responsible for significant losses to livestock and has important involvement on public health.

Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ) were administered. Non-parametric tests and structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the data. Findings: The prevalence of depression was 18.4%, anxiety 46.4% and stress 13.1%, with relatively good productivity. Gender, age, education level, job experiences, marital status, number of children and nature of the organization were associated with the employees' psychological health but not with their productivity, while the workspace availability influenced both outcomes.

OD data are very informative but many are not peer-reviewed, often inconclusive and may reveal variable and sometimes contradictory results. This is often due to incongruent data of subjective and objective OD testing. Mechanistic pathways of OD and taste dysfunction (TD) are slowly unveiling, not infrequently extrapolated from historical models of SARS and MERS and are still partly unclear.

Also, we evaluated various methods of subjective and objective olfactory testing and discussed challenges in management of patients with OD and rhinitis during the pandemic. SUMMARY Subjective evaluation of smell disturbances during COVID-19 pandemic likely underestimates true prevalence, severity, and recovery rates of OD when compared to objective testing. OD is predictive of COVID-19 infection, more so when associated with TD. Recognizing inherent limitations of both subjective and objective OD and TD testing enables us better to manage chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.

Conversely, B-cell-depleting therapy was the primary driver of re-hospitalization for COVID-19. In patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we observed high levels of viral entropy consistent with intrahost viral evolution, particularly in patients with impaired CD8+ T-cell immunity.

The ability of employees to deal with the successful combining of work, family responsibilities, and personal life is crucial for both employers and family members of employees. During the COVID-19 emergency situation, many people around the world were forced to work remotely. Initially, there were observed some certain expectations about the possibility of working from home as a positive factor that will promote workClife balance. However, over time, negative tendencies were also revealed, as employees were only one call or message away from the employer, and uncertainty and leisure time with family often created more stress. As many organizations and individuals were not ready for this sudden change, many mistakes were made, which further raised the issue of workClife balance.

They are more likely to continue living with obesity into adulthood and to develop obesity-related chronic health conditions at a younger age. Regulating the marketing of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods and beverages has been highlighted as a promising approach to obesity prevention. In 2019, Transport for London implemented restrictions on the advertisement of HFSS products across its network. This paper reports on a process evaluation of the design and implementation of this intervention. METHODS In 2019-2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 stakeholders. Interviews with those responsible for implementation (n = 13) explored stakeholder roles, barriers and facilitators to policy development/implementation and unintended consequences. Interviews with food industry stakeholders (n = 10) explored perceptions and acceptability of the policy, changes to business practice and impact on business. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS Practical challenges included limited time between policy announcement and implementation, translating the concept of 'junk food' into operational policy, the legal landscape, and reported uneven impacts across industry stakeholders. Political challenges included designing a policy the public views as appropriate, balancing health and financial impacts, and the perceived influence of political motivations. Consultation during policy development and close communication with industry reportedly facilitated implementation, as did the development of an exceptions process that provided a review pathway for HFSS products that might not contribute to children's HFSS consumption. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that restricting the outdoor advertisement of HFSS foods and beverages at scale is feasible within a complex policy and business landscape. We outline practical steps that may further facilitate the development and implementation of similar policies and we report on the importance of ensuring such policies are applied in a way that is perceived as reasonable by industry and the public.","output":"Restricting the advertising of high fat, salt and sugar foods on the Transport for London estate: Process and implementation study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on a sample of 63 listed European banks, this paper investigates the relationship of capital and asset quality, in terms of provisioning and coverage policies, with bank risk and performance during the period 2005Q1-2018Q4.

METHODS: Blood samples from adult patients with mild and severe COVID-19 and healthcare workers who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (2nd dose at 12-week intervals) and BNT162b2 vaccine (2nd dose at 3-week intervals) were collected and compared by immunoglobulin G immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 specific spike protein using an in-house-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients, including 12 and 41 with mild and severe COVID-19, respectively, were analyzed. In addition, a total of 73 healthcare workers, including 37 who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 36 who received BNT162b2, were enrolled. Antibody responses after the first and second doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine were similar to those in convalescent patients with mild COVID-19, but lower than those in convalescent patients with severe COVID-19, respectively. However, after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, the antibody response was comparable to that in convalescent patients with severe COVID-19.

This assumes that they acquire valuable socio-economic resources abroad which help them to create successful businesses upon return. However, we have scant knowledge of the impact of the geopolitical context on returnee entrepreneurs or their coping strategies. Latin American returnees in particular have received little attention and few studies focus on migrants with South-to-South return trajectories. Emphasising the role of territorial conflicts and the agency of individuals, I use a feminist geopolitical perspective to address these gaps. I contribute to migration, mobility, and development studies by studying whether Colombian migrants returning from Venezuela can reintegrate as successful entrepreneurs. Further, I offer the concept of transmobilities to study the cross-border nature of strategies of reintegration. The 30 returnees studied have a trajectory of repeated forced mobilities, ranging from internal displacement in Colombia, subsequent emigration to Venezuela, and final deportation to Colombia by Venezuelas government. I combine the qualitative methods of multi-sited ethnography, biographical interviews, mental maps, and participatory Minga workshops. The analysis shows that Colombian returnees face intense difficulties in reintegrating despite their strong motivation and entrepreneurial spirit. The geopolitical context of armed struggle, an absent Colombian state, and territorial conflicts between Colombia and Venezuela create an unfavourable environment for returnee entrepreneurs. Consequently, they develop transmobility strategies  including the movement of people, goods, and capital across national borders  at the risk of their own lives.

COVID-19 presents a high mortality rate, estimated at 3.4%. More than 1 out of 4 hospitalized COVID-19 patients require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory support, and a large proportion of these ICU-COVID-19 patients, between 17% and 46%, have died. In these patients COVID-19 infection causes an inflammatory response in the lungs that can progress to inflammation with cytokine storm, Acute Lung Injury (ALI), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), thromboembolic events, disseminated intravascular coagulation, organ failure, and death. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are potent immunomodulatory cells that recognize sites of injury, limit effector T cell reactions, and positively modulate regulatory cell populations. MSCs also stimulate local tissue regeneration via paracrine effects inducing angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and remodeling responses. MSCs can be derived in large number from the Umbilical Cord (UC). UC-MSCs, utilized in the allogeneic setting, have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for a number of disease conditions including inflammatory and immune-based diseases. UC-MSCs have been shown to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs and have been utilized to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in pilot, uncontrolled clinical trials, that reported promising results. UC-MSCs processed at our facility have been authorized by the FDA for clinical trials in patients with an Alzheimer's Disease, and in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that UC-MSC will also exert beneficial therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm and ARDS. We propose an early phase controlled, randomized clinical trial in COVID-19 patients with ALI/ARDS. Subjects in the treatment group will be treated with two doses of UC-MSC (l00  106 cells).

AACP President Anne Lin charged the RGAC with developing resources and programs for training faculty and graduate students in implementation science. The committee was further charged with developing a mechanism to pair pharmacy faculty and implementation experts on practice advancement projects. In its work, the committee focused on generating near-term opportunities for pharmacy practice faculty to pursue projects while developing programs that would support ongoing career development and future implementation practice and research by pharmacy faculty and trainees.To support training, the RGAC developed a competency framework for graduate education that builds on the six domains of graduate education in pharmaceutical sciences put forward by the 2016-2017 RGAC. The new, specialized framework identifies and organizes those competencies that should be cultivated to successfully pursue implementation research in pharmacy, with utility beyond graduate education. The identified competencies could act as the base for pharmacy-specific implementation science training materials suitable for faculty development. The committee proposes a faculty development program that leverages the framework and existing implementation science training resources offered by federal agencies and universities to provide facilitated learning opportunities and peer support for faculty who wish to pursue implementation research.The committee considered multiple approaches AACP could take to promote collaboration between pharmacy faculty and implementation experts. While recognizing the importance of individual development support for pharmacy faculty, the committee felt that a focus on supporting interdisciplinary teams that span practice and research and engage faculty, trainees and preceptors would have the greatest impact on enabling practice advancement projects in the near term while increasing capacity in the long-term. The committee envisions a program in which AACP creates opportunities for pharmacy faculty and implementation experts to come together with the purpose of matching researchers and projects. AACP support for these collaborations should begin prior to any such matching event, for example by helping pharmacy faculty articulate the scope and value of their proposed practice advancement projects, and extend beyond the initial match to include assisting nascent collaborations establish connections and secure institutional and external backing.The RGAC made specific recommendations to AACP about how the framework and proposed programs could be used to further develop pharmacy faculty and graduate students as researchers while advancing the goal of sustainable transformation of pharmacy practice. A key recommendation is that AACP cultivate an inclusive community of interest in implementation science in pharmacy that will promote adoption of the framework, act as facilitators and coaches for training programs and assist in planning and supporting collaborative research projects.","output":"Building Implementation Science Capacity in Academic Pharmacy: Report of the 2020-2021 AACP Research and Graduate Affairs Committee."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (HD) have limited work capacity. Many structural and functional alterations in skeletal muscles contribute to this disability. METHODS To evaluate the effects of exercise training on uraemic myopathy, seven HD patients (mean age 44.1+/-17.2 years) were studied. Open muscle biopsies were taken from their vastus lateralis muscle before and after a 6-month exercise rehabilitation programme and examined by routine light- and transmission electron-microscopy. Histochemical stainings of frozen sections were performed and morphometric analysis was also applied to estimate the proportion of each fibre type and the muscle fibre area. Spiroergometric and neurophysiological testing and peak extension forces of the lower limbs were measured before and after exercise training. RESULTS All patients showed impaired exercise capacity, which was associated with marked muscular atrophy (mean area 2548+/-463 microm2) and reduction in muscle strength and nerve conduction velocity. All types of fibres were atrophied, but type II were more affected. The ultrastructural study showed severe degenerative changes in skeletal muscle fibres, mitochondria, and capillaries. Exercise training had an impressive effect on muscular atrophy; in particular the proportion of type II fibres increased by 51% and mean muscle fibre area by 29%. Favourable changes were also seen on the structure and number of capillaries and mitochondria. These results were confirmed by a 48% increase in VO2 peak and a 29% in exercise time, as well as an improvement in the peak muscle strength of the lower limbs and in nerve conduction velocity. CONCLUSIONS Skeletal muscle atrophy in HD patients contribute to their poor exercise tolerance. The application of an exercise training rehabilitation programme improved muscle atrophy markedly, and therefore had beneficial effects in overall work performance.","output":"The effects of exercise training on muscle atrophy in haemodialysis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines have supported outpatient treatment of low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) since 2014, but adoption of this practice has been slow. Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is now as common as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, but data are sparse regarding outcomes for patients with low-risk PE treated with DOACs as outpatients. We conducted a systematic review of literature on outcomes of outpatient management for PE, including comparisons to inpatient treatment and differences by anticoagulant class. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and ICTRN for studies published from January 1980 through February 2019 using a predefined strategy developed with a medical librarian. We included English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective nonrandomized trials (NRTs) of adult patients diagnosed with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and discharged from the emergency department (ED) or within 48 hours. Our primary outcome included four major adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding) within 30 and 90 days. A preplanned subanalysis of high-quality studies assessed outcomes associated with different anticoagulation treatment classes. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 6,818 records, of which 12 studies (4 RCT, 8 NRT) with a total of 3191 patients were included in the review. All RCTs and six NRTs were determined to have low-moderate risk of bias and were classified as high quality. Outpatients in these studies (n=1814) had rates of 90-day major adverse outcomes below 1%, including all-cause mortality (0.7% [95% CI 0.4-1.2%]), PE-related mortality (0.06% [0.01-0.3%]), recurrent VTE (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]) and major bleeding (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]). Exploratory analysis revealed no association between anticoagulant treatment class and rates of major adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with low-risk PE treated as outpatients, few patients experienced major adverse outcomes such as mortality, recurrent VTE, or major bleeding within 90 days.","output":"Outpatient Treatment of Low-Risk Pulmonary Embolism in the Era of Direct Oral Anticoagulants: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reindeer husbandry is essential for the livelihood and culture of indigenous people in the Arctic.

However, even soluble proteins often fail to represent functional activity because of the involvement of non-functional, misfolded, soluble aggregates, which compromise recombinant protein quality. Therefore, screening of solubility and folding competence is crucial for improving the quality of recombinant proteins, especially for therapeutic applications. The issue is often highlighted especially in bacterial recombinant hosts, since bacterial cytoplasm does not provide an optimal environment for the folding of target proteins of mammalian origin. Antibody fragments, such as single-chain variable fragment (scFv), single-chain antibody (scAb), and fragment antigen binding (Fab), have been utilized for numerous applications such as diagnostics, research reagents, or therapeutics. Antibody fragments can be efficiently expressed in microorganisms so that they offer several advantages for diagnostic applications such as low cost and high yield. However, scFv and scAb fragments have generally lower stability to thermal stress than full-length antibodies, necessitating a judicious combination of designer antibodies, and bacterial hosts harnessed with robust chaperone function. In this review, we discuss efforts on not only the production of antibodies or antibody fragments in microorganisms but also scFv stabilization via (i) directed evolution of variants with increased stability using display systems, (ii) stabilization of the interface between variable regions of heavy (V(H)) and light (V(L)) chains through the introduction of a non-native covalent bond between the two chains, (iii) rational engineering of V(H)-V(L) pair, based on the structure, and (iv) computational approaches.

These molecules recruit T-cells and mast cells to the diseased site and orchestrate a complex interplay between cells that culminates in keratinocyte cell death, mucosal basement membrane destruction and long-term chronicity of the disease.

However, bleeding risk is also significant, causing difficulty in initiating and adjusting anticoagulation therapy in case of suspected thrombi. Cardiac masses can be challenging to be identified properly in the context of this disease. The use of bedside contrast echocardiography (CE) can be of a great value in this situation decreasing procedure-related risk and allowing proper diagnosis and management of a cardiac mass. Cases summary: We present two cases who were admitted with severe COVID-19 infection. Both cases had additional risk factors for hypercoagulability. Un-enhanced echocardiography was performed and revealed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with a suspected RV mass. The use of bedside CE could confirm a RV thrombus in the first case and exclude it in the second case. Hence, anticoagulation therapy could be adjusted accordingly in both patients. Discussion: Coronavirus disease 2019 infection is associated with peripheral thrombo-embolism and cardiac thrombi. Given the critical condition of many patients affected by COVID-19, imaging for thrombo-embolic events is often restricted.

This paper initially proposes a comprehensive workflow in which an integrated hierarchy-correlation model is used to thoroughly evaluate the influences of all relevant reservoir parameters on the ultimate oil recovery for water-flooding oil reservoirs. More specifically, the analytic hierarchy process, grey relation, and entropy weight are combined through the multiplicative weighting method to quantitatively describe the production parameters. Accordingly, novel multivariable linear and nonlinear correlations are developed to predict the production performance and validated through comparisons with numerical reservoir simulations. Seven factors, including five reservoir parameters, namely, permeability and its contrast, porosity, thickness, and saturation, and two production parameters, namely, the injection-production ratio and the operating pressure, have been identified as the most influential factors on recovery performances and thus are employed in the proposed correlations to predict the ultimate oil recovery factor. The results obtained by the proposed method are quite close to the real-time simulation data, while the accuracy is retained. The numerical results show that the recovery factors of water-flooding oil reservoirs are about 33.5-59.5%, and the corresponding linear and nonlinear correlation coefficients are 0.903 and 0.789, respectively. In comparison with the numerical simulation, the approximation error by the linear correlation is about 0.5%, which is lower than that of nonlinear correlation, for example, 12.3%.

In our CGNet, there are three components including feature extraction, graph-based feature reconstruction and classification. We first use the transfer learning technique to train the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for binary classification while the trained CNNs are used to produce features for the following two components. Then, by deploying graph-based feature reconstruction, we, therefore, combine features through the graph to reconstruct features. Finally, a shallow neural network named GNet, a one layer graph neural network, which takes the combined features as the input, classifies chest X-ray images into normal and pneumonia. Our model achieved the best accuracy at 0.9872, sensitivity at 1 and specificity at 0.9795 on a public pneumonia dataset that includes 5,856 chest X-ray images. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method on detection of pneumonia caused by COVID-19, we also tested the proposed method on a public COVID-19 CT dataset, where we achieved the highest performance at the accuracy of 0.99, specificity at 1 and sensitivity at 0.98, respectively.","output":"CGNet: A graph-knowledge embedded convolutional neural network for detection of pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies regarding interunit dispersion used Reynolds\\\\averaged NavierCStokes (RANS) models and thus obtained only mean dispersion routes and re\\\\entry ratios. Given that the envelope flow around a building is highly fluctuating, mean values could be insufficient to describe interunit dispersion. This study investigates the wind\\\\induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings using the large eddy simulation (LES) method. This is the first time interunit dispersion has been investigated transiently using a LES model. The quality of the selected LES model is seriously assured through both experimental validation and sensitivity analyses. Two aspects are paid special attention: (i) comparison of dispersion routes with those provided by previous RANS simulations and (ii) comparison of timescales with those of natural ventilation and the survival times of pathogens. The LES results reveal larger dispersion scopes than the RANS results. Such larger scopes could be caused by the fluctuating and stochastic nature of envelope flows, which, however, is canceled out by the inherent Reynolds\\\\averaged treatment of RANS models. The timescales of interunit dispersion are comparable with those of natural ventilation. They are much shorter than the survival time of most pathogens under ordinary physical environments, indicating that interunit dispersion is a valid route for disease transmission.","output":"Large eddy simulation of wind\\\\induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a previously healthy 41-year-old man right-handed man diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed multiple cortical ischemic infarcts Our patient developed mild neurologic deficits despite the total volume of cerebral ischemic lesions, presumably due to involvement of non-eloquent cortex, the integrity of the collateral circulation due to his youth and good health, and mild COVID-19 disease without any significant pulmonary involvement We discuss the coagulopathy and direct vascular effects, if any, of COVID-19 disease and compare it to other agents such as the filovirus, ad Ebola We also outline the recent intriguing findings of vasodilation of the pulmonary vessels and the potential shunting of micro-emboli into the brain, which may explain the formation of embolic ischemic infarcts in even mild disease Lastly, we discuss the neuropathology of COVID-19 in patients that who have succumbed to the disease and note the striking lack of direct involvement of the cerebral blood vessels","output":"COVID-19-Induced Ischemic Infarcts With Normal Coagulation Profile and Excellent Outcome: A Case Report With Highlights on the Thrombotic Diathesis, Recent Transcranial Doppler Findings, and Neuropathology Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis during the current pandemic, as well as to describe the main computed tomography (CT) findings in patients suffering from both diseases simultaneously.

These case examples show that in these disruptive times, the teachers were more actively building new practices supported by the community dynamics and systemic processes of the KBC. Consequently, the interactions between stakeholders shifted from disjointed relations in different hierarchical levels to a network community of people, ideas, and resources, and teachers continually advancing their knowledge-building practice in these challenging times. ? 2021, Canadian Network for Innovation in Education.

Overactivity of RAAS promotes both systemic and regional glomerular capillary hypertension, which could induce hemodynamic injury to the glomerulus, leading to kidney damage and renal fibrosis via profibrotic and proinflammatory pathway. Therefore, the use of RAAS inhibitors (i.e., ACEIs, ARBs, and MRAs) as the optional therapy has been demonstrated to prevent proteinuria, and kidney fibrosis and slow the decline of renal function effectively in the process of kidney disease during the last few decades. Recently, several new components of the RAAS have been discovered, including ACE2 and the corresponding ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis, which are also present in the kidney. Besides the classic RAAS inhibitors target the angiotensin-AT1-aldosterone axis, with the expanding knowledge about RAAS, a number of potential therapeutic targets in this system is emerging. Newer agents that are more specific are being developed.

Information regarding coronavirus infection in pregnancy is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to describe the clinical course of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Study Design: This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020, and April 20, 2020. Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours on chest imaging. Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative. The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge. Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery. The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms. Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported. Results: Of 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 (69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease. The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2. Gestational age was at a mean of 296 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 306 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms. Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir. All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.01). Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%. There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death. Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]). Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission. Conclusion: In pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]). Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality. Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.

Methods: EEGs performed in patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between 25/03/2020 and 06/05/2020 in the University Hospital of Bictre were independently reviewed by two experienced neurologists. We used the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's terminology for the description of abnormal patterns. EEGs were classified into five categories, from normal to critically altered. Interobserver reliability was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Medical records were reviewed to extract demographics, clinical, imaging and biological data. Results: Forty EEGs were reviewed in 36 COVID-19 patients, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) and 22 in medicine units. The main indications were confusion or fluctuating alertness for 23 (57.5%) and delayed awakening after stopping sedation in ICU in six (15%). EEGs were normal to mildly altered in 23 (57.5%) contrary to the 42.5% where EEG alterations were moderate in four (10%), severe in eight (20 %) and critical in five (12.5%). Generalized periodic discharges (GPDs), multifocal periodic discharges (MPDs) or rhythmic delta activity (RDA) were found in 13 recordings (32.5%). EEG alterations were not stereotyped or specific. They could be related to an underlying morbid status, except for three ICU patients with unexplained encephalopathic features.

Since the demand for laboratory reagents has increased, there has been a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. We, therefore, developed a fast and cost-effective viral genome isolation method that, combined with quantitative RT-PCR assay, detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples.

This pathway of hidden risks, which has not previously been discussed in the literature, stems from a public expectation that citizens will enjoy risk premiums and adequate old-age benefits, an expectation that evolves into political pressure. The outcomes of this risk path are realized in financial transfers, such as means-tested social security and minimum pension guarantees. Consequently, funded pension designs converge naturally into a new landscape paradigm of risk-sharing, with intergenerational and intragenerational components.

Often, these tumors are removed through large anatomical resections which sacrifice more liver parenchyma than needed. Tumor enucleation, which takes advantage of a digitoclasia-like technique along the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and liver parenchyma, poses challenges when performed laparoscopically. We propose a parenchymal sparing, minimally invasive, robotic-assisted technique to remove liver hemangiomas. PRESENTATION OF CASES Three male patients with symptomatic hemangiomas were treated in our center between 2015 and 2018. The lesions were located in segment II, III and segment IV-V respectively. Robotic-assisted hemangioma enucleation was accomplished successfully in all three patients. The procedures were performed with a parenchyma-sparing intent and a formal segmentectomy was not required. There were no conversions to open surgery. DISCUSSION The robotic platform provides a powerful tool in the enucleation of liver hemangiomas. The enhanced vision and the superior suturing ability allow to develop safely the plane between the tumor pseudo-capsule and the liver parenchyma, with outstanding selective control of all the vascular supply and drainage encountered during the dissection. Furthermore, precision of the hilar dissection allows selective lobar or sectorial arterial control which helps minimize intraoperative bleeding. CONCLUSION In our experience, robot-assisted enucleation of liver hemangiomas offers low morbidity, fast recovery, excellent cosmetic results, and it could become a therapeutic option when the location of the hemangioma allows this approach.","output":"Robot-assisted enucleation of gigantic liver hemangiomas: Case series of 3 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Spring/Summer 2020, most individuals living in the United States experienced several months of social distancing and stay-at-home orders because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs. EWs also perceived a slightly greater risk of contracting COVID-19. These findings, which we discuss in the context of persistent structural inequalities, systemic racism, and health inequities within the United States, highlight ways in which COVID-19 exacerbates existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities faced by EWs.","output":"Clinicians, cooks, and cashiers: Examining health equity and the COVID-19 risks to essential workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has officially been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. A comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in the fight against COVID-19 remains urgent and mandatory. Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the radiological role in the fight against COVID-19. This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19. The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes. A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion. Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.","output":"Radiological role in the detection, diagnosis and monitoring for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins is mediated by their interaction with adaptor proteins. Conversely, emerging evidence suggests adaptor protein recruitment to the plasma membrane may depend on binding to endocytic cargo. To test this idea we analyzed the yeast adaptor protein Sla1, which binds membrane proteins harboring the endocytic signal NPFxD via the Sla1 SHD1 domain. Consistently, SHD1 point mutations that disrupt NPFxD binding caused a proportional reduction of Sla1-GFP recruitment to endocytic sites. Furthermore, simultaneous SHD1 point mutation and deletion of the SR region linking Sla1 to coat proteins Pan1 and End3 resulted in total loss of Sla1-GFP recruitment to the plasma membrane. The data suggests multiple interactions are needed for recruitment to the membrane. Interestingly, a Sla1 fragment containing just the third SH3 domain - which binds ubiquitin - and SHD1, displayed broad surface localization suggesting plasma membrane recruitment is mediated by interaction with both NPFxD-containing and ubiquitinated plasma membrane proteins. Our results also imply that a Sla1 NPF motif adjacent to the SR region may regulate the Sla1-cargo interaction, mechanistically linking Sla1 cargo binding to endocytic site recruitment.","output":"Cargo-Mediated Recruitment of the Endocytic Adaptor Protein Sla1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of pregnant women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The measurements were taken at an air quality monitoring station called Belisario, which is in Quito, Ecuador; the data collection time period was 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2019, and the measurements were carried out using photometric O(3) analyzers. Here, the measurement results were used to build variables that represented hours, days, months, and years, and were then classified and categorized. The index of air quality (IAQ) of the city was used to make the classifications, and robust and nonrobust confidence intervals were used to make the categorizations. Furthermore, robust analysis methods were compared with classical methods, nonparametric methods, and bootstrap-based methods. The results showed that the analysis using robust methods is better than the analysis using nonrobust methods, which are not immune to the influence of extreme observations. Using all of the aforementioned methods, confidence intervals were used to both establish and quantify differences between categories of the groups of variables under study. In addition, the central tendency and variability of the O(3) concentration at Belisario station were exhaustively analyzed, concluding that said concentration was stable for years, highly variable for months and hours, and slightly changing between the days of the week.

DESIGN: Qualitative study. Data were collected in person or via phone using different methods: 38 semistructured interviews, 11 informal walk-through care pathways interviews, 5 focus groups (n=25), 5 codesign workshops (n=43). Data were thematically analysed using the framework approach, informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. SETTING: Stakeholders recruited across five UK major trauma networks. PARTICIPANTS: A variety of stakeholders were recruited (n=117) including trauma survivors, rehabilitation physicians, therapists, psychologists, trauma coordinators and general practitioners. We recruited 32 service users (trauma survivors or carers) and 85 service providers. RESULTS: There were several issues associated with implementing a trauma VR intervention including: culture within healthcare/employing organisations; extent to which healthcare systems were networked with other organisations; poor transition between different organisations; failure to recognise VR as a priority; external policies and funding. Some barriers were typical implementation issues (eg, funding, policies, openness to change). This study further highlighted the challenges associated with implementing a complex intervention like VR (eg, inadequate networking/communication, poor service provision, perceived VR priority). Our intervention was developed to overcome these barriers through adapting a therapist training package, and by providing early contact with patient/employer, a psychological component alongside occupational therapy, case coordination/central point of contact, and support crossing sector boundaries (eg, between health/employment/welfare). CONCLUSIONS: Findings informed the implementation of our VR intervention within the complex trauma pathway.

This has adversely impacted child development and wellbeing, particularly for children from priority populations (culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and rural/regional communities) who are at an already increased risk of health inequality. The increased mental health and psychosocial needs were compounded by the closure of in-person preventive and health promotion programs resulting in health organisations embracing technology and online services. Watch Me Grow- Electronic (WMG-E) C developmental surveillance platform- exemplifies one such service. WMG-E was developed to monitor child development and guide parents towards more detailed assessments when risk is identified. This Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to expand WMG-E as a digital navigation tool by also incorporating parents mental health and psychosocial needs. Children and families needing additional assessments and supports will be electronically directed to relevant resources in the care-as-usual group. In contrast, the intervention group will receive continuity of care, with additional in-person assessment and warm hand over by a service navigator to ensure their needs are met. METHODS: Using an RCT we will determine: (1) parental engagement with developmental surveillance; (2) access to services for those with mental health and social care needs; and (3) uptake of service recommendations. Three hundred parents/carers of children aged 6 months to 3 years (recruited from a culturally diverse, or rural/regional site) will be randomly allocated to the care-as-usual or intervention group. A mixed methods implementation evaluation will be completed, with semi-structured interviews to ascertain the acceptability, feasibility and impact of the WMG-E platform and service navigator. CONCLUSIONS: Using WMG-E is expected to: normalise and de-stigmatise mental health and psychosocial screening; increase parental engagement and service use; and result in the early identification and management of child developmental needs, parental mental health, and family psychosocial needs. If effective, digital solutions such as WMG-E to engage and empower parents alongside a service navigator for vulnerable families needing additional support, will have significant practice and policy implications in the pandemic/post pandemic period.

Using a simple random sampling method, self-report questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students from the Tianfu College of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE), who participated in this study. This resulted in 373 usable questionnaires. In all five dimensions of service quality, a gap was observed between students' perceptions and expectations, and are listed in ascending order as follows: tangible: -0.073, assurance: 0.015, empathy: 0.050, responsiveness: 0.052, and reliability: 0.056. The gap analysis between service quality perceptions and expectations showed that all scores for perceptions were higher than expected, except for the tangible dimension. Nevertheless, the negative gap is small and negligible. This finding indicates that the service quality of tangible dimension could be slightly improved. Specifically, the university must upgrade facilities and equipment to improve the fluency of the teaching network, and skills of teachers should be improved to advance their teaching methods, in order to support online teaching and learning, which could reduce the gap of service quality of tangible dimension between student perceptions and expectations. ? 2021 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

NOTES tumor enucleation may provide an alternative to laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of NOTES tumor creation and enucleation as a multidisciplinary approach. METHODS A linear-array endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) endoscope was used to inject a thermosensitive ABA triblock polymer mixed with methylene blue through the stomach wall and into the distal pancreas using a 22-gauge EUS needle. Due to its thermosensitive character, the polymer solidifies in response to body temperature, creating an artificial tumor. Seventeen swine underwent NOTES transgastric pancreatic tumor enucleation. Nine nonsurvival animals were sacrificed immediately after the NOTES procedure, with subsequent necropsy. Eight survival animals were observed for up to 16 days after the procedure, subsequently sacrificed, followed by necropsy. RESULTS The procedure was performed successfully in all 17 pigs studied, 9/9 nonsurvival (100%) and 8/8 survival (100%) animals, using a pure NOTES approach without any laparoscopic ports. Complications included two esophageal dissections (1 in nonsurvival group, 1 in survival group) caused by the introduction of the endoscopic overtube (2/17, 12%), unrelated to the actual surgical procedure. In the survival animals, there were two small splenic lacerations caused during retraction with the endoscopic forceps, for which hemostasis was achieved prior to closure of the gastrotomy (2/7, 29%). At necropsy of the animals, there was sufficient closure of 15/17 gastrotomy sites (88%). CONCLUSIONS The creation of artificial pancreatic tumors via EUS guidance is feasible.

METHODS Twenty consecutive patients scheduled for PTCD were included in the study. All patients were sedated during the procedure using midazolam and propofol. Aside from standard monitoring, additional capnographic monitoring was used and analyzed by an independent observer. RESULTS The mean ( SD) cumulative duration of apnea demonstrated by capnography was significantly longer than the mean cumulative duration of clinically detected apnea (207.5  348.8 s versus 8.2  17.9 s; P=0.015). The overall number of detected episodes of apnea was also significantly different (113 versus seven; P=0.012). There were 15 events of oxygen desaturation (decrease in oxygen saturation [SaO2]  5%), which were predicted in eight of 15 cases by capnography and in one of 15 cases by clinical observation.

These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities and potentially increase the risk of death. SUMMARY Individuals with malnutrition, sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity and older adults with abnormal body composition or malnutrition risk may require tailored medical nutrition therapy to improve short and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and alterations of body composition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To discuss the techniques and methods in resective operation of brain gliomas located in eloquent brain region under awake anesthesia state METHODS: 21 patients admitted into Department of Neurosurgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University were chosen as subject. Diagnosed with brain gliomas, they received operation with neuronavigation, intraoperative ultrasonography for locating the lesion and intraoperative direct electric stimulation for functional mapping of the eloquent brain region after receiving awake anesthesia. All patients were followed up from post-surgical 3 months to 18 months. RESULTS Applied with MRI scanning during post-surgical 60 - 90d, resection results shows that 5 cases (23.8%) received total resection of lesions, 10 cases (47.6%) received subtotal resection while 6 cases (28.6%) received partial resection. Post-surgical performance shows 8 cases (38.1%) of transitory postoperative aphasia, 5 cases(23.8%) of transitory postoperative dyskinesia and 1 case(4.8%) of permanent dyskinesia. Recovery was achieved in the patients except for the 1 case of permanent dyskinesia.

However, technological success is widely dependent on complete understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of tumor biology on one hand and nanobiointeractions associated with challenges of synthesis, translation, and commercialization on the other. The present study therefore deals with one such targeted approach aiming at synthesizing, characterizing, and understanding the efficacy of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles. The phase structure, morphology, and elemental composition of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity studies revealed that the IC(50) vales of molybdenum trioxide (MoO(3)) particles against skin cancer cells (melanoma and non-melanoma) were around 200C300 g. The nanoparticles were found to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis driven by the apoptotic genes such as BAX and Bcl(2). Molybdenum being a cofactor for the majority of metabolic enzymes could have triggered the selective internalization of the nanoparticles which in turn could have modified the granularity of the cytoplasm and subsequently lead to mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Further, the anti-angiogenic property of MoO(3) nanoparticles was corroborated using Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and aortic ring assay. Taken together , unraveling the role of MoO(3) nanoparticles in cancer and angiogenesis opens up venues for nano biological intervention of selective cancer cell targeting with minimal damage to the normal cells using natural trace elements that are generally known to influence various metabolic enzymes.","output":"Steering Efficacy of Nano Molybdenum Towards Cancer: Mechanism of Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While policy-makers in many jurisdictions are paying increasing attention to health workforce issues, human resources remain at best only partially aligned with population health needs. This paper explores the governance of human resources during the pandemic, looking at the Quebec health system as a revelatory case. We identify three issues related to health human resource (HHR) policies: working conditions, recognition at work and scope of practice. We empirically probe these issues based on an analysis of popular media, policy reports and participant observation by the lead authors in various forums and research projects. Using an integrated model of HHR, we identify major vulnerabilities in this domain. Persistent labour shortages, endemic deficiencies in working environments and inequity across occupational categories limit the ability to address critical HHR issues. We propose three ways to eliminate HHR vulnerabilities: reorganize work through participatory initiatives, implement joint policy making to rebalance power across the health workforce, and invest in the development of capacities at all system levels.","output":"Global health and innovation: A panoramic view on health human resources in the COVID-19 pandemic context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 and heart failure (HF) are common disorders and although they share some similar symptoms, they require different treatments. Accurate diagnosis of these disorders is crucial for disease management, including patient isolation to curb infection spread of COVID-19. In this work, we aim to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system that can accurately differentiate these three classes (normal, COVID-19 and HF) using cough sounds. A novel handcrafted model was used to classify COVID-19 vs. healthy (Case 1), HF vs. healthy (Case 2) and COVID-19 vs. HF vs. healthy (Case 3) automatically using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) patterns. The model was developed using the cough sounds collected from 241 COVID-19 patients, 244 HF patients, and 247 healthy subjects using a hand phone. To the best our knowledge, this is the first work to automatically classify healthy subjects, HF and COVID-19 patients using cough sounds signals. Our proposed model comprises a graph-based local feature generator (DNA pattern), an iterative maximum relevance minimum redundancy (ImRMR) iterative feature selector, with classification using the k-nearest neighbor classifier. Our proposed model attained an accuracy of 100.0%, 99.38%, and 99.49% for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively.

These complexities increase during the clinical phases, where drug safety and efficacy milestones are still underdeveloped. For example, for autologous therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, in which the treatment is developed from the patient's own cells, supply chain management plays an integral role in chemistry, manufacturing and control processes. Supply chain management requires proactive planning because of the strict cold chain requirements and time sensitivity of CGTs. This research examines strategies and responses to challenges experienced by industry stakeholders (e.g., sponsors and manufacturers) during the implementation phases of clinical supply chain management. This research further evaluates the adequacy of the current regulatory framework for distribution and supply chain management of CGTs in the US. METHODS: A survey methodology was used to query subject matter experts from the biopharmaceutical industry who were familiar with the clinical supply management of CGTs in the US. The survey instrument was developed using an implementation framework and disseminated electronically to mid- and senior-level subject matter experts who had experience with clinical trials, supply chain management and CGTs. RESULTS: A total of 128 respondents accessed the survey, and 105 respondents answered at least one question. Seventy-five respondents completed the survey. Results showed that a lack of harmonization in regulations across the supply chain, limited resources, challenges with vendor management, high costs and complexities in the supply chain due to product specificity and customization proved to be impediments for the industry. In addition, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had a significant impact on supply chain implementation. The results revealed that less than half of the respondents had business continuity plans in place. These challenges increased for smaller and mid-size organizations. Thirty percent of small and mid-size organizations were less prepared to scale up than larger companies. CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions from industry stakeholders were to adopt and enforce Good Distribution Practices in the US (81%), pre-plan distribution strategies with internal and external stakeholders along the supply chain and develop agile systems and robust processes end to end. Hurdles in scaling up and scaling out from the clinical to commercial phases for time- and temperature-sensitive CGT products make it difficult to predict the supply chain's long-term feasibility. Although there are initiatives to improve these impediments, such as improving industry partnerships and creating global CGT transportation standards, there are still regulatory knowledge gaps present for CGTs. Therefore, it is essential to establish a baseline and foundation for CGT supply chains extending beyond the loading dock.","output":"An industry survey of implementation strategies for clinical supply chain management of cell and gene therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A well-functioning alimentary canal is required for adequate nutrient absorption.

Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic. METHODS: We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms. We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines. We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments. Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.

In food terms, this fragmentation is evidenced by pressures on food heritage, by the homogenization of diets and food practices, the loss of traditions, recipes, techniques and traditional preparations, among others. An additional pressure on food heritage is the popularization of hygienist discourse and increasingly stringent safety standards. Likewise, food modernity and the COVID 19 pandemic have generated insecurity in consumers and food fears in relation to the food consumed that can restrict their consumption. This article addresses the effect of food fear on the consumption of typical foods and the consequent loss of food heritage, taking as an example the consumption of typical foods of Colombian gastronomy prepared with hydrated corn dough. Based on an expert consultation (N = 102;57 F, 45 M), it was evidenced that part of the consumers identify physical, chemical and microbiological risks in typical foods, and experience food fears that restrict their intake outside the home in spaces of cultural tradition such as stalls on the street and market places. There was also evidence of a limited reproduction of traditional recipes, even within homes, materializing a risk of loss of food heritage. Finally, it is concluded that this risk of loss of food heritage resides in the influence of modern nutritional habits on cultural values that are fragmented and disappear, such as the oral transmission of knowledge and culinary practices intergenerationally, family and community cohesion around food and the radical disappearance of recipes as well as their preparations.","output":"Food fears and risk of loss of food heritage: A little-explored effect of food modernity and times of pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arsenic intoxication affects male reproductive parameters of prepubertal rats.

Male pups on postnatal day (PND) 21 received filtered water (controls, n = 10) and 10 mg L-1 arsenite (n = 10) daily for 30 days. From PND52 to PND81, rats from both groups received filtered water. During this period, the males mated with non-exposed females between PND72 and PND75. Our results showed that sexually mature rats presented low sperm production, epididymal sperm count, motility, and quality after prepubertal arsenic exposure. These findings possibly contributed to the low fertility potential and high preimplantation loss. Epididymal sperm proteome detected 268 proteins, which 170 were found in animals from both control and arsenic groups, 27 proteins were detected only in control animals and 71 proteins only in arsenic-exposed rats. In these animals, SPATA 18 and other five proteins were upregulated, whereas keratin type II cytoskeletal 1 was downregulated (q < 0.1). The results of KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated an enrichment of pathways related to dopaminergic response, adrenergic signaling, protein degradation, and oocyte meiosis in arsenic-exposed animals. Moreover, 26 proteins were identified by phosphoproteomic with different phosphorylation pattern in animals from both groups, but SPATA18 was phosphorylated only in arsenic-exposed animals.

Mortality rates of solid organ transplant recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 range as widely as 5-67%. Some of these reports therefore seem to suggest that immunosuppressed patients have a similar mortality when compared to non-immunosuppressed patients. Also, there is limited data on the incidence of bacterial and fungal superinfections in these critically ill COVID-19 patients who are immunosuppressed. Our study aims to understand the impact of immunosuppression on the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to our intensive care units (ICUs). Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients with COVID-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to the ICUs of a quaternary care hospital between 03/01/2020 and 05/31/2020. Patients on chronic immunosuppressive medications were identified. Demographic and clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers at the time of ICU admission and clinical outcomes of these patients were compared and analyzed with patients who were not immunosuppressed. Means, medians and categorical variables were compared using t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. P-value of &lt;0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. Results:Of the 210 patients admitted to our ICUs with COVID-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, 23 (11%) were taking immunosuppressant medications before they were admitted to our unit. 11 patients had a history of organ transplantation (Liver: 4, Kidney: 4, Heart: 2 and Stem cell transplantation: 1). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographics, comorbidities, severity as indicated by inflammatory markers and outcomes such as death, acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis, and bacterial or fungal superinfection. Conclusion: Our study seems to imply that there is no significant difference in the severity and outcomes of the immunosuppressed patients who were admitted to our ICUs. Our study did show an increased incidence of mortality (52.17% vs. 44.02%) and an increased rate of positive sterile fluid cultures (34.78% vs. 25.13%) in these immunosuppressed patients but the difference was not statistically significant. It is possible that an increased sample size may have revealed statistically significant differences.

However, little is known regarding its characteristics in terms of systemic inflammation and organ injury, especially compared with classical bacterial sepsis. This article aims to learn the clinical characteristics and prognosis between COVID-19-associated sepsis and classic bacterial-induced sepsis. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, septic patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a government-designed therapy center in Shenzhen, China between Jan 14, 2020 and Mar 10, 2020, and septic patients induced by carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumonia (CrKP) admitted at the ICU of the Second Peoples Hospital of Shenzhen, China between Jan 1, 2014 and Oct 30, 2019, were enrolled. Demographic & clinical parameters including comorbidities, critical illness scores, treatment, and laboratory data, as well as prognosis were compared between the two groups. Risk factors for mortality and survival rate were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and survival curve. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with COVID-19 and 63 patients with CrKP were enrolled. A direct comparison between the two groups demonstrated more serious degrees of primary lung injury following 2019-nCoV infection (indicated by lower PaO(2)/FiO(2)) but milder systemic inflammatory response, lower sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and better functions of the organs like heart, liver, kidney, coagulation, and circulation. However, the acquired immunosuppression presented in COVID-19 patients was more severe, which presented as lower lymphocyte counts. Moreover, the proportion of COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroid therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was larger compared with CrKP patients who required less invasive mechanical ventilation. The incidence of hospitalized mortality and length of ICU stay and total hospital stay were also lower or shorter in viral sepsis. Similar results were obtained after being adjusted by age, gender, comorbidity and PaO2/FiO2. Lymphocytopenia and high acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACH II) scores were common risk factors for in-hospital death. While the death cases of COVID-19 sepsis mostly occurred at the later stages of patients hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Critical COVID-19 shares clinical characteristics with classical bacterial sepsis, but the degree of systemic inflammatory response, secondary organ damage and mortality rate are less severe. However, following 2019-nCoV infection, the level of immunosuppression may be increased and thus induce in more death at the later stage of patients hospital stay.","output":"Severe COVID-19-associated sepsis is different from classical sepsis induced by pulmonary infection with carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumonia (CrKP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination provides a powerful tool for mitigating and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

The second complexity is biological: though several COVID-19 vaccines offer substantial protection against infection and disease, breakthrough reinfection of vaccinees (and subsequent retransmission from these individuals) can occur, driven especially by new viral variants. Here, using a simple epidemiological model, we show that the combination of infection of remaining susceptible individuals and breakthrough infections of vaccinees can have significant effects in promoting infection of invading variants, even when vaccination rates are high and onward transmission from vaccinees relatively weak. Elaborations of the model show how heterogeneities in immunity and mixing between vaccinated and unvaccinated sub-populations modulate these effects, underlining the importance of quantifying these variables. Overall, our results indicate that high vaccination coverage still leaves no room for complacency if variants are circulating that can elude immunity, even if this happens at very low rates.","output":"Vaccine breakthrough and the invasion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The long-term COVID-19 effects are currently unknown. Whether and for how long symptoms extend beyond the acute phase of the disease is unresolved. Aim of this study was to determine the functional capacity of COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and describe its association with dyspnoea, the most frequent symptom after discharge from a tertiary care hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: All COVID-19 patients discharged from our tertiary care institution were enrolled in a prospective follow-up study which would assess clinical, instrumental and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 survivors at 3 months from hospital discharge (i.e. long-covid). To limit bias in dyspnoea quantification, patients hospitalized in residential care facilities with severe cognitive impairment/disability, ischaemic cardiopathy, and/or heart failure and severe respiratory disease (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were excluded. Clinical evaluation included: peripheral blood samples including inflammatory cytokines, pulmonary function testing (functional respiratory and 6 min-walking test), lung ultrasound, ECG recording, and a comprehensive echocardiographic exam. All patients with peripheral oxygen desaturation at 6 min-walking test (SpO(2) < 92%), dyspnoea and with a history of hospitalization in critical care settings were referred for CPET. Dyspnoea was classified with the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. From June 2020 to May 2021, 198 patients were enrolled; overall, 42% of patients presented with dyspnoea at 3 months from hospital discharge with no difference according to disease severity on hospital admission (P = 0.233). Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were similar between patients with and without dyspnoea. At CPET, 61% of patients complaining dyspnoea showed a %peak VO(2) lower than 85% of the predicted value, associated with a lower exercising tolerance and duration and with a globally reduced equivalent metabolic load (METS: 5.3  1.2 vs. 6.6  1.6, P = 0.003). Mean anaerobic threshold was lower for symptomatic patients (46 + 13 vs. 50 + 10, P = 0.03). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for age, number of comorbidities, and body mass index, only %peak VO(2) (HR: 0.973; 95% CI: 0.948C0.998) and male gender (HR: 0.548; 95% CI: 0.328C0.999) were associated with dyspnoea. CONCLUSIONS: At 3-months, almost 1-in-2 patients discharged for COVID-19 pneumonia presented with dyspnoea, irrespective of disease severity. Among patients undergoing CPET, only %peak VO(2) and gender were associated with symptoms suggesting a potential systemic inflammatory-mediated response and important gender related differences for the long-covid.","output":"782 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with COVID-19 at 3 months from hospital discharge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study uses time-series models to estimate preexposure prophylaxis prescription trends during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York State in 2020.","output":"Evaluation of Trends in Preexposure Prophylaxis Prescriptions During the First 6 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease has caused seven million infections worldwide, of which, 3.1 million individuals have recovered.

The colonization rate of HCWs or the hospital setting that contributes most to MRSA colonization is less clear. In this study, we studied new resident physicians (PGY-1), as a model for HCWs, to measure their colonization rate and hypothesized that the incidence of colonization would increase during their first year. Methodology We prospectively enrolled PGY-1 residents of multiple specialties at three academic medical centers. After obtaining informed consent, PGY-1 residents were tested for MRSA in June 2019 before starting any clinical rotations and then retested every three to four months thereafter. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic forced us to end the study early. If MRSA-positive, residents were treated with 2% mupirocin and retested for a cure. For comparison, upper-level residents (PGY-2-5) were also enrolled to obtain a baseline prevalence of colonization. Results We enrolled 80 PGY-1 and 81 PGY-2-5 residents in the study. The baseline prevalence of MRSA colonization was 4.94% (4/81) in PGY-2-5 residents and 2.50% (2/80) for new PGY-1 residents; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.68). The cumulative yearly incidence of developing MRSA colonization in PGY-1 residents was 4.51%. MRSA colonization was successfully treated in 75% of cases. Conclusions PGY-1 residents had a lower MRSA colonization rate compared to PGY-2-5 residents, although this was not statistically significant. PGY-1 residents had a small incidence of developing MRSA colonization while working in the hospital.

OBJECTIVES To determine if preceding visceral arteriography with computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage increases hemorrhage identification and localization and to determine if CTA was superior to nuclear scintigraphy when used as a pre-angiogram test. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis was conducted of prospectively acquired data from an interventional radiology database and of individual electronic medical records from an academic tertiary medical center. On January 1, 2009, a new, evidence-based, institutional protocol that formally incorporated CTA to manage acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage was launched after multidisciplinary consultation. All records of patients who underwent visceral angiography (VA) for acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012, were evaluated. EXPOSURES Imaging, procedural, and operative details were abstracted from the medical records of all patients who underwent VA for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visceral angiography results and efficacy were compared in patients before and after protocol implementation and compared based on which imaging method was used prior to angiography. RESULTS A total of 161 angiographic procedures were performed during the study period (78 before and 83 after protocol implementation). Use of CTA increased from 3.8% to 56.6%, and use of nuclear scintigraphy decreased from 83.3% to 50.6% following protocol implementation (P < .001). Preceding angiography with CTA resulted in similar angiography contrast administration (mean [SD] amount for CTA prior to VA, 135 [63] vs 160 [77] mL; P = .18) and fluoroscopy time (mean [SD], 26.3 [16.8] vs 32.2 [34.9] minutes; P = .34). Although nuclear scintigraphy and CTA had similar sensitivity and specificity, localization of hemorrhage site by CTA was more precise and consistent with angiography findings. As a pre-angiography test, compared with nuclear scintigraphy, CTA reduced overall the number of imaging studies required (mean [SD] number per patient admission, 2.1 [0.3] vs 2.5 [0.8]; P = .005) and resulted in administration of more overall contrast (mean [SD], 220 [80] vs 130 [70] mL; P < .001) without worsening renal function. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Preceding VA with a diagnostic study improves positive localization of the site of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage compared with VA alone. Increasing the use of CTA for pre-angiography imaging may reduce overall imaging studies while appearing to increase positive yield at VA. Computed tomographic angiography can be used as part of a lower intestinal hemorrhage management algorithm and does not appear to worsen renal function despite the additional contrast load.","output":"Arteriography for Lower Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage: Role of Preceding Abdominal Computed Tomographic Angiogram in Diagnosis and Localization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) constitute a large and diverse subfamily of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They are found in many mammals and birds and have great importance for the health of humans and farm animals.

One of the first things during inflammation is the response by acute phase proteins coupled with coagulation. The angiotensinogen (a substrate for hypertension) is one such acute phase protein and goes on to explain an association of covid-19 with that of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2, a metallopeptidase). Therefore, it is advisable to administer, and test the efficacy of specific blocker(s) of angiotensinogen such as siRNAs or antibodies to covid-19 subjects. Covid-19 activates neutrophils, macrophages, but decreases T-helper cells activity.

METHODS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of 857 renal biopsies collected at The Canberra Hospital. Samples with predominant C3 staining were reviewed by a renal histopathologist. Of 31 biopsies with predominant C3 staining, 10 fulfilled histological criteria for C3 glomerulonephritis, while the remaining 21 cases were used as C3 Controls. RESULTS: Aside from a higher incidence of C3 glomerulonephritis in Torres Strait islanders (40% vs 5% C3 Controls, p = 0.04), presentation demographics were similar between the two groups. Median creatinine at diagnosis was higher in patients with C3 glomerulonephritis (253 umol/L IQR 103-333 vs 127 umol/L C3 Controls, IQR 105-182, p = 0.01). Prior to reclassification, a majority of C3 glomerulonephritis cases were diagnosed as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (60% vs 5% (C3 Controls) p < 0.01).

Among the main detection approaches, the one based on crowd signals from DMND users has stood out by obtaining promising results. In essence, in order to classify a piece of news as fake or not fake, such approach explores the collective sense by combining opinions (signals, i.e., votes about the classification of some news) of a high number of users (crowd), considering the reputations of these users regarding their capacity of identifying Fake News. Although promising, the Crowd Signals approach has a significant limitation: it depends on the explicit user opinion (which is not always available) about the classification of the analyzed news. Such unavailability may be caused by the absence of a functionality in the DMND that collects user opinion about the news, or by the simple option of the users in not giving their opinion. Facing this limitation, the present work raises the hypothesis that it is possible to build models of Fake News detection with a performance comparable to the Crowd Signals based approach, avoiding the dependence on the explicit opinion of DMND users. To validate this hypothesis, the present work proposes HCS, an approach based on crowd signals that considers implicit user opinions instead of the explicit ones. The implicit opinions are inferred from the behavior of users concerning the dissemination of the news analyzed. Inspired in Meta-Learning, the HCS can also use the explicit opinions from machines (news classification models) to complement the implicit user opinions by means of hybrid Crowds. Experiments carried out in five datasets presented significant evidence that confirms the raised hypothesis. Even without considering DMND users explicit opinions, HCS was able to achieve results comparable to the ones produced by the Crowd Signals approach. Besides that, the results also revealed a performance improvement of HCS when the implicit opinions of the users were combined with the explicit opinions of machines.","output":"Fake News Detection Based on Explicit and Implicit Signals of a Hybrid Crowd: An Approach Inspired in Meta-Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic diseases pose many challenges to health care providers and the health care system from a human capital, logistic, and financial perspective.

Clustering at the facility-level was addressed using hierarchical models. RESULTS: The cohort included 6,117 residents with advanced illness (mean age (SD) = 82.8 (8.4) years, 65% female). Among long-stay residents (n = 3,902), 9.3% (SE, 2.2; 95% CI 5.0C13.6) and 4.2% (SE, 1.1; 95% CI 2.1C6.3) acquired a new DNH order in the treatment and control arms, respectively (average marginal effect, (AME) 5.0; SE, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.3C9.8). Among short-stay residents with advanced illness (n = 2,215), 8.0% (SE, 1.6; 95% CI 4.6C11.3) and 3.5% (SE 1.0; 95% CI 1.5C5.5) acquired a new DNH order in the treatment and control arms, respectively (AME 4.4; SE, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.5C8.3).

It has been observed that patients with severe COVID-19 develop a dysbiotic microbiota of the gut. This impact may be long-lasting, resulting in a greater possibility of a future diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) or aggravating the condition in those already afflicted. Given that CRC is the third most common and third deadliest type of cancer, we must understand how infection with SARS-CoV-2 will impact CRC biology and treatment strategies. ABSTRACT: The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in December 2019 led to a worldwide pandemic with over 170 million confirmed infections and over 3.5 million deaths (as of May 2021). Early studies have shown higher mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients than individuals without cancer. Herein, we review the evidence that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and has been linked to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Investigations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes changes to the gut microbiota, including an overall decline in microbial diversity, enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteremia, and depletion of beneficial commensals, such as the butyrate-producing bacteria. Further, these changes lead to increased colonic inflammation, which leads to gut barrier disruption, expression of genes governing CRC tumorigenesis, and tumor immunosuppression, thus further exacerbating CRC progression. Additionally, a long-lasting impact of SARS-CoV-2 on gut dysbiosis might result in a greater possibility of new CRC diagnosis or aggravating the condition in those already afflicted. Herein, we review the evidence relating to the current understanding of how infection with SARS-CoV-2 impacts the gut microbiota and the effects this will have on CRC carcinogenesis and progression.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Induced Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis: Implications for Colorectal Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower respiratory tract infections comprise a wide range of pathologies and causative pathogens that require differentiating in order to administer the most appropriate treatment.

Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.","output":"Age-dependent assessment of genes involved in cellular senescence, telomere and mitochondrial pathways in human lung tissue of smokers, COPD and IPF: Associations with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is generating a high number of deaths worldwide.

Eleven bibliographic databases were systematically searched for papers and reports published from 1999 to 2019 that described future of work scenarios or identified future work-related hazards. To compile a comprehensive collection of views of the future, supplemental and ad hoc searches were also performed. After screening all search records against a set of predetermined criteria, the review yielded 36 references (17 peer-reviewed, 4 gray, and 15 supplemental) containing scenarios. In these, the future of work was described along multiple conceptual axes (e.g. labor market changes, societal values, and manual versus cognitive work). Technology was identified as the primary driver of the future of work in most scenarios, and there were divergent views in the literature as to whether technology will create more or fewer jobs than it displaces. Workforce demographics, globalization, climate change, economic conditions, and urbanization were also mentioned as influential factors. Other important themes included human enhancement, social isolation, loneliness, worker monitoring, advanced manufacturing, hazardous exposures, sustainability, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Pandemics have not been widely considered in the future of work literature, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic illustrates that was short-sighted. Pandemics may accelerate future of work trends and merit critical consideration in scenario development. Many scenarios described new or exacerbated psychosocial hazards of work, whereas comparatively fewer discussed physical, chemical, or biological hazards. Various preventive recommendations were identified. In particular, reducing stress associated with precarious work and its requirements of continual skill preparation and training was acknowledged as critical for protecting and promoting the health and well-being of the future workforce.

SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time.

A latent class analysis revealed that nearly half (49.4%) of surveyed children and youth reported patterns in changes in their emotional state that may contribute to lower SWB. Results from binomial logistic regression suggest that socio-demographic characteristics and size of the municipality were not associated with low pandemic-time SWB. Instead, other potentially modifiable factors such as having access to friends, indoor and outdoor spaces/places to play and exercise, and healthy movement behaviours during the pandemic, were correlated with a lower likelihood of reporting low SWB.

Fractal analysis of medical imaging has a potential to quantify this structural heterogeneity in the tumor AIMS: The purpose of this study is to quantify this structural abnormality in the tumor applying fractal analysis to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) image and to evaluate its biomarker value for predicting survival of surgically treated gastric cancer patients. METHODS A total of 108 gastric cancer patients (77 men and 31 women; mean age: 69.1 years), who received curative surgery without any neoadjuvant therapy, were retrospectively investigated. Portal-phase CE-CT images were analyzed with use of a plug-in tool for ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA), and the fractal dimension (FD) in the tumor was calculated using a differential box-counting method to quantify structural heterogeneity in the tumor. Tumor FD was compared with clinicopathologic features and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS High FD value of the tumor significantly associated with high T stage and high pathological stage (P = 0.009, 0.007, respectively). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with higher FD tumors (FD > 0.9746) showed a significantly worse DSS (P = 0.009, log rank). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor FD, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors for DSS. In subset analysis of lymph-node positive gastric cancers, only tumor FD was an independent prognostic factor for DSS.

Important contributions are in terms of assessing the effect of the temporary short selling ban on restricted health-care stocks;the effect of COVID-19 cases and crude oil price volatility onto health-care stocks;and whether COVID-19 resulted in a change in the risk and average stock price of health-care stocks. Design/methodology/approach The methodology involves impulse responses to capture the shock of the short selling ban onto health-care stocks, and Markov switching regimes to capture the effect of COVID-19 onto the risk and prices in the health-care industry. Daily data from 9 November 2018 till 23 December 2020 is used. Findings Findings suggest there were significant changes in average prices in health-care technology and health-care services stocks before, during and after the short selling ban. Shocks to the number of COVID-19 cases and crude oil price volatility impacted health-care stocks but lasted only for a few days. While daily changes in the number of COVID-19 cases impacted some health-care stocks in the presence of a two-state Markov regime, insignificant coefficients and relatively low duration suggest that the short selling policy did not significantly change the average price and risk in health-care stocks to explain a two-state regime in the health-care industry. Research limitations/implications Insignificant coefficients in a two-state Markov regime reinforce that short-selling policies have a short-lasting effect onto health-care equity prices. The findings are limited by the duration of the short selling policy, the pandemic event and the health-care industry.

Two patients with circumferential fusiform aneurysm, one being an aneurysm of the segments P2 and P3 of the posterior cerebral artery, diagnosed after a headache, and the other a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the lower basilar artery, diagnosed following ischemia of the brain stem. Endovascular treatment was performed by means of a vascular reconstruction technique that used at different surgical times: overlapping; a telescoped self-expandable stent, LEO+; and a flow-diverter device, SILK. Angiographic control was carried out at 6 and 12 months, to evaluate arterial patency, flow maintenance in the arterial branches and perforating vessels, and thrombosis of the aneurysm. The combined use at different surgical times of the self-expandable stent and flow-diverter device was technically successful in both patients. There were no complications during the procedure, nor in the long-term follow-up with full arterial vascular reconstruction, maintenance of cerebral perfusion and complete aneurysm occlusion at the 6- and 12-month angiographic follow-up.

Methods: In this retrospective study, data from a referral trauma center were reviewed from February 21, 2020, to April 10, 2020. All patients admitted to the hospital for whom a chest CT scan was performed for any reason during the study period were included. Trained physicians screened all CT scans for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Next, blinded radiologists selected CT scans with findings highly suggestive of COVID-19 involvement. The clinical course and outcome and the results of PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recorded and assessed. Results: A total of 4200 chest CT scans were reviewed. After multiple rounds of exclusion, 24 patients with highly-suggestive findings were reviewed. Only three patients developed COVID-19 symptoms during the course of admission. PCR results were positive in 22 patients (92.6%). Conclusion: We recommend chest CT scans in trauma patients at a high risk of COVID-19 infection, as well as those requiring extensive surgical interventions. Also, a thorough review of the available CT scans before invasive procedures, preferably with the help of an expert radiologist, is highly recommended, even when the results of the COVID-19 laboratory tests are negative.","output":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in multiple trauma patients: incidence and implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media is one of the largest sources of propagating information, however, it is also a home ground for rumors and misinformation.

Recent evidence suggests that an increased burden of senescent cells (SCs) in the adipose tissue of obese/diabetic animal models might underlie such pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, the role of macrophages as candidate SCs, their phenotype, the distribution of SCs among fat depots, and clinical relevance are debated. The senescence marker ?-galactosidase and the macrophage marker CD68 were scored in visceral (vWAT) and subcutaneous (scWAT) adipose tissue from obese patients (n=17) undergoing bariatric surgery and control patients (n=4) subjected to cholecystectomy. A correlation was made between the number of SCs and BMI, serum insulin, and the insulin resistance (IR) index HOMA. The monocyte cell line (THP-1) was cultured in vitro in high glucose milieu (60 mM D-glucose) and subsequently co-cultured with human adipocytes (hMADS) to investigate the reciprocal inflammatory activation. In obese patients, a significantly higher number of SCs was observed in vWAT compared to scWAT; about 70% of these cells expressed the macrophage marker CD68; and the number of SCs in vWAT, but not in scWAT, positively correlated with BMI, HOMA-IR, and insulin. THP-1 cultured in vitro in high glucose milieu acquired a senescent-like phenotype (HgSMs), characterized by a polarization toward a mixed M1/M2-like secretory phenotype. Co-culturing HgSMs with hMADS elicited pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in both cell types, and defective insulin signaling in hMADS. In morbid obesity, expansion of visceral adipose depots involves an increased burden of macrophages with senescent-like phenotype that may promote a pro-inflammatory profile and impair insulin signaling in adipocytes, supporting a framework where senescent macrophages fuel obesity-induced systemic inflammation and possibly contribute to the development of IR.","output":"Senescent macrophages in the human adipose tissue as a source of inflammaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a pathological pattern defined by the characteristic presence of buds of granulation tissue within the lumen of distal pulmonary airspaces consisting of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts intermixed with loose connective matrix. This pattern is the hallmark of a clinical pathological entity, namely cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) when no cause or etiologic context is found. The process of intraalveolar organization results from a sequence of alveolar injury, alveolar deposition of fibrin, and colonization of fibrin with proliferating fibroblasts. A tremendous challenge for research is represented by the analysis of features that differentiate the reversible process of OP from that of fibroblastic foci driving irreversible fibrosis in usual interstitial pneumonia because they may determine the different outcomes of COP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), respectively. Three main imaging patterns of COP have been described: (1) multiple patchy alveolar opacities (typical pattern), (2) solitary focal nodule or mass (focal pattern), and (3) diffuse infiltrative opacities, although several other uncommon patterns have been reported, especially the reversed halo sign (atoll sign). Definitive diagnosis is based on (1) a suggestive clinical radiological presentation, (2) the demonstration of the characteristic pathological pattern at lung histopathology, and (3) exclusion of possible causes. Transbronchial biopsies or a transthoracic biopsy may also contribute to the pathological diagnosis. Rapid clinical and imaging improvement is obtained with corticosteroid therapy. Because of the risk of misdiagnosing alternative conditions that may mimic OP, only typical cases may be managed without histopathological confirmation, and patients should be followed with particular attention paid to any clue of alternate diagnosis, especially in case of incomplete response to treatment.

People supporting stronger punishment are more likely to consider the government's reaction to the pandemic as insufficient. However, after the establishment of tougher sanctions for risky behaviors, we observe a sudden flip in support for government. Higher amounts of the desired fines become associated with a higher probability of considering the government's policy response as too extreme, lower trust in government, and lower confidence in the truthfulness of the officially provided information.

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. Methods Health care workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n=12,990) was performed using semi quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to previously reported pseudovirus neutralising antibody measurements. Findings A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r=0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti S1 measurements correlated with near contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r=0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks of follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling suggested faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). Interpretation Mild SARS CoV 2 infection is associated with heterogenous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition.

Primary health care (PHC) is uniquely positioned to provide the holistic and continual care recommended for this group of patients, including support for self-management. The aim of this study was to explore professionals, patients, and family caregivers perspectives on how PHC professionals should support self-management in patients with multimorbidity. This study also includes experiences of using telemedicine to support self-management. METHODS: A mixed qualitative method was used to explore regular self-management support and telemedicine as a tool to support self-management. A total of 42 participants (20 physicians, 3 registered nurses, 12 patients, and 7 family caregivers) were interviewed using focus group interviews (PHC professionals), pair interviews (patients and family caregivers), and individual interviews (registered nurses, patients, and family caregivers). The study was performed in urban areas in central Sweden and rural areas in southern Sweden between April 2018 and October 2019. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The main theme that emerged was Standing on common ground enables individualized support. To achieve such support, professionals needed to understand their own views on who bears the primary responsibility for patients self-management, as well as patients self-management abilities, needs, and perspectives. Personal continuity and trustful relationships facilitated this understanding. The findings also indicated that professionals should be accessible for patients with multimorbidity, function as knowledge translators (help patients understand their symptoms and how the symptoms correlated with diseases), and coordinate between levels of care. Telemedicine supported continual monitoring and facilitated patient access to PHC professionals. CONCLUSION: Through personal continuity and patient-centered consultations, professionals could collaborate with patients to individualize self-management support. For some patients, this means that PHC professionals are in control and monitor symptoms. For others, PHC professionals play a less controlling role, empowering patients self-management. Development and improvement of eHealth tools for patients with multimorbidity should focus on improving the ability to set mutual goals, strengthening patients inner motivation, and including multiple caregivers to enhance information-sharing and care coordination.

These glycoproteins are key to the infection process as they are mediators of the receptor binding and membrane fusion of the virion with the host cell. Therefore, they are attractive therapeutic targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Recently, carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) were shown to possess antiviral activity towards coronaviruses. The current study further elucidates the inhibitory mode of action of CBA. METHODS: Different strains of two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, were exposed to CBA: the plant lectins Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) and the non-peptidic mannose-binding antibiotic pradimicin A. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CBA target the two glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, the spike (S) and membrane (M) protein, of mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. Furthermore, CBA did not inhibit virusCcell attachment, but rather affected virus entry at a post-binding stage. The sensitivity of coronaviruses towards CBA was shown to be dependent on the processing of the N-linked carbohydrates. Inhibition of mannosidases in host cells rendered the progeny viruses more sensitive to the mannose-binding agents and even to the N-acetylglucosamine-binding UDA. In addition, inhibition of coronaviruses was shown to be dependent on the cell-type used to grow the virus stocks. All together, these results show that CBA exhibit promising capabilities to inhibit coronavirus infections.","output":"The carbohydrate-binding plant lectins and the non-peptidic antibiotic pradimicin A target the glycans of the coronavirus envelope glycoproteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of electrochemical DNA biosensors in real genomic sample detection is challenging due to the existence of complex structures and low genomic concentrations, resulting in inconsistent and low current signals. This work highlights strategies for the treatment of non-amplified and amplified genomic dengue virus gene samples based on real samples before they can be used directly in our DNA electrochemical sensing system, using methylene blue (MB) as a redox indicator. The main steps in this study for preparing non-amplified cDNA were cDNA conversion, heat denaturation, and sonication. To prepare amplified cDNA dengue virus genomic samples using an RT-PCR approach, we optimized a few parameters, such as the annealing temperature, sonication time, and reverse to forward (R/F) primer concentration ratio. We discovered that the generated methylene blue (MB) signals during the electrochemical sensing of non-amplified and amplified samples differ due to the different MB binding affinities based on the sequence length and base composition. The findings show that our developed electrochemical DNA biosensor successfully discriminates MB current signals in the presence and absence of the target genomic dengue virus, indicating that both samples were successfully treated. This work also provides interesting information about the critical factors in the preparation of genomic gene samples for developing miniaturized PCR-based electrochemical sensing applications in the future.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients with sudden chemosensory loss since February 2020 and confirmed COVID-19 infection via RT-PCR or serology testing. Olfactory function was tested extensively using the \\"Sniffin Sticks\\" test battery. In addition, we screened gustatory perception and nasal cooling sensations using psychophysical tests. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients completed the study. After a mean of 37 days, 37% of patients showed olfactory dysfunction, 7% were dysgeusic, and 48% showed signs of low sensitivity for cooling sensation. A longer duration of anosmia before smell improvement was correlated with lower olfactory function at 5 weeks. Odor threshold detection was more affected by COVID-19 compared to odor identification. CONCLUSION: Five weeks after developing sudden chemosensory loss due to COVID-19, a high proportion of patients were dysosmic and showed signs of low nasal cooling sensitivity, whereas most of them had normal taste function. SARS-CoV-2 affected mainly odor thresholds, possibly suggesting that the major cause of loss of smell lies at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than in the central nervous system.","output":"Psychophysical evaluation of chemosensory functions 5 weeks after olfactory loss due to COVID-19: a prospective cohort study on 72 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scales assessing stressor exposure often fail to demonstrate adequate psychometric qualities, demonstrating low interitem reliability or complex factor structures, as would be expected, given that the majority of stressors are independent events.

With repeat winter waves of COVID-19 or other viral pathogens in the future being likely, we sought to review the impact of the response to the first wave on the delivery and training of neurosurgery in a large tertiary neurosurgical centre. Methods: We performed a retrospective review over the three-month period of 8 th March to 7 th June 2020 as indicative of the peak of the pandemic in the UK. For referrals, our online referral portal was reviewed (ORION). For admissions and operations, electronic patient records were reviewed (EPIC systems). Trust wide update emails and policies were also reviewed. Results: In response to the pandemic, neurosurgical service provision was severely restricted in the early days of the pandemic in the form of reduced beds, medical and nursing staff and theatres. This was rapidly realised to be unsustainable, and resources were slowly reopened although not to pre-COVID-19 levels. Although referrals did not substantially reduce, the number of elective and emergency admissions, length of stay, theatre efficiency and operative numbers (by pathology and grade of operating surgeon) did significantly reduce except for emergencies performed by consultants. If similar trainee operating numbers would have persisted, this would lead to a significant delay to completion of training. Conclusions: All aspects of neurosurgical provision were detrimentally affected due to the rapid response to the first wave of COVID-19 in our institution. Such repeated reductions in acute services such as neurosurgery would be unsustainable.

Young Americans, who are particularly affected by these trends, have started to demand big structural change in the American political and economic system.

A corpus-based analysis of Warrens framing reveals that two frames are prevalent in her discourse on inequality: the fairness-frame and the wealth-frame.

The data were collected from the patients medical records. RESULTS: We found 15 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Four patients were suspected to be infected by COVID-19, but none of them was confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 based on the PCR test. All patients had a history of injury: fell from height (53.3%), traffic accident (40%), and direct trauma (6.7%). The average time interval from injury to hospital admission was 38.6 h, from admission to surgery was 6.3 days, and from injury to surgery was 8.1 days.

Endoscopy with water submersion was performed to evaluate for injury or leak. RESULTS: After multiple passes of the NGT, no significant injuries, leaks, or perforations were observed to the gastric model, except for several small petechiae of the gastric mucosa, the largest measuring approximately 3 mm. None were of full thickness or penetrated the mucosa. The staple line showed no evidence of trauma. CONCLUSION: In this porcine model, blind NGT placement was not associated with significant mucosal injury or any damage to the sleeve gastrectomy staple line.","output":"Blind nasogastric tube advancement following sleeve gastrectomy: an animal model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Item 503(c) of the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions (SECs) Regulation S-K requires firms to disclose the most significant factors that affect them in their Item 1A risk factor disclosures made in their 10-K (annual) or 10-Q (quarterly) SEC filings. Prior to COVID-19, firms discussed risk factors such as Liquidity, Competition, etc. as part of their Item 1A disclosures. The current pandemic has resulted in the COVID-19 risk factor being widely discussed as part of firms Item 1A risk factor disclosures. A firm-specific discussion on this transient risk factor is unique in the sense that it can affect the salience of other already disclosed less transient but significant risk factors to investors and other stakeholders. Using a sample of 68 firms hard hit by COVID-19 with prior poor performance, I find that market reactions to their Item 1A risk factor disclosures were significantly more positive if they disclosed the COVID-19 risk factor in a certain firm-specific manner compared to those that didnt. These results suggest that stakeholder perceptions of firms risk profiles are being biased to some extent as the less transient but other significant risk factors that were already affecting these firms seem to be underweighted by them in evaluating the firms risk profiles. I explain this bias further using the meta-theoretical framework of the elaborate likelihood model.

We report the unusual finding of BCG reactivation in an infant with laboratory-confirmed measles. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 7-month old infant presented initially with fever, cough and coryza, and subsequently developed Kopliks spots followed by a typical morbilliform skin rash. There was significant contact history with a household relative who had recently been diagnosed with measles. On examination, a 2.5 cm area of erythema and induration was seen at the previous BCG inoculation site, in addition to the widespread maculopapular rash. No other clinical features of KD were present. Measles virus was isolated from the throat swab and measles antibodies (IgM) were present in the serum. The patient recovered completely with oral vitamin A and supportive therapy, and had normal echocardiography examination on follow up.

Therefore, in order to select suitable donors, neutralizing antibody titer against SARS CoV-2 needs to be determined.

In this study, a total of 140 serum samples that had been titrated for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody by microneutralization assay were also tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody using 5 different tests: Architect? immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostics), detecting IgG against the nucleocapsid protein, LIAISON XL?

To determine which immunoassay had the highest chance to detect sera with neutralizing antibodies above a certain threshold, we compared the results obtained from the five immunoassays with the titers obtained by microneutralization assay by linear regression analysis and by using receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's index.

On the one hand, the current saturation hinders the devices' driving ability, which can be eliminated with carefully engineered contact configurations. On the other hand, by introducing the nonlinearity to monolithic analog artificial neural network circuits, the circuits' perception ability can be significantly enhanced, as evidenced using a COVID-19 critical illness prediction model.

The empirical research using a soft modeling method supplements theoretical deliberations based on critical literature review. A conceptual model was adopted. Three first-order latent variables were selected for the analysis: 'online customer behavior';, 'online activity';and 'willingness to spend online';, to which all analyzed indicators (14) were classified. The analysis of the loadings of latent variables for 2019 and 2020 allowed the impact of the pandemic on customer behavior to be observed, although this was not the same across all EU countries. Clustering performed with the hit map enabled the identification of four groups of countries. Significant changes in behavior were observed in countries such as Poland, Ireland, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, and Finland.

TCGA, GEO and TIP datasets, and immunohistochemistry and western blot results were used to determine the prognostic and clinicopathological characteristics of ACE2. ACE2 expression was down-regulated in ccRCC tissues and cell lines. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results indicated that increased ACE2 expression was independent predictor of longer OS (HR: 0.8259, 95%CI: 0.7734-0.8819, P<0.0001) and RFS (HR: 0.8023, 95%CI: 0.7375-0.8729, P<0.0001) in ccRCC patients. Lower ACE2 expression was also associated with advanced tumor stage, higher histological grade and pathological stage, and metastasis. Besides, ACE2 expression was significantly positively and negatively correlated with CD4 Na?ve infiltration and CD4 Memory infiltration, respectively. Moreover, higher CD4 Na?ve and lower CD4 Memory infiltration levels were associated with better pathological features and longer OS and RFS. Furthermore, high ACE2 expression group in decreased CD4 Na?ve, enriched CD4 Na?ve and enriched CD4 memory cohort had favorable prognosis. These findings identified that AEC2 was significantly reduced in ccRCC, and decreased ACE2 was related to worse pathological features and poor prognosis.

Interleukin (IL)-12, a crucial innate cytokine, was found to be regulated by such xenobiotic agents. This study aimed at testing whether IL-12 profiles may be indicative of heavy metals-induced immunomodulation. METHODS: Human immunocompetent cells, activated either by monoclonal antibodies or heat-killed Salmonella enterica, were cultured in the absence or presence of cadmium (Cd) acetate or mercuric (Hg) chloride. In vivo experiments were set up where BALB/c mice were exposed to sub-lethal doses of Cd or Hg salts for 3 or 5 weeks. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT-reduction assay. Modulation of cytokine profiles was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), cytometric bead-based array (CBA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the relevance of these methods of cytokine quantification was explored. RESULTS: Modulation of IL-12 profiles in Cd- or Hg-exposed human PBMC was dose-dependent and significantly related to IFN- levels as well as to the Th1- or Th2-polarized responses. Similarly, skewing the Th1/Th2 ratios in vivo correlated significantly with up- or down-regulation of IL-12 levels in both cases of investigated metals. CONCLUSION: It can be inferred that: (i) IL-12 profiles alone may represent a relevant indicator of heavy metal-induced immune modulation; (ii) evaluating cytokine profiles by CBA is relevant and can adequately replace other methods such as ELISA and RT-PCR in basic research as well as in immune diagnostics; and (iii) targeting IL-12 in therapeutic approaches may be promising to modify Th1/Th2-associated immune disorders.","output":"The role of interleukin-12 in the heavy metal-elicited immunomodulation: relevance of various evaluation methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess an otolaryngology-specific surgical priority scoring system that incorporates varying levels of mucosal involvement.

This mucosal score was incorporated into the Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) score to generate a MeNTS-Mucosal (MeNTS-M) score. A retrospective cohort of patients was identified to assess the surgical priority scoring systems. Inclusion criteria included all scheduled surgical procedures between March 23, 2020, and April 17, 2020. Decisions about whether to proceed or cancel were made based on best clinical judgment by surgeons, without use of any surgical priority scores. The predictive value of the surgical priority scoring systems was assessed in this retrospective cohort. RESULTS: The median MeNTS score was significantly lower in adult patients whose surgery proceeded compared to those for whom the surgery was cancelled (48 vs 56; P = .004). Mucosal and MeNTS-M scores were not statistically different based on whether surgery proceeded. Among adult patients, the highest area under the curve (AUC) was for the MeNTS scoring system (0.794); both the mucosal and MeNTS-M systems had lower AUC values (which were significantly lower than the AUC for the MeNTS scoring system).

METHODS: A systematic, integrative review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, based on a systematic search in PubMed, CHINAL full plus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: A total of 17 scientific papers covering intensive care, paediatric care, general medical care, hospital care, palliative care and nursing home settings were included. Although appreciation for the technical solutions enabling remote meetings was reported, visiting restrictions had several consequences, mainly negative, for the patient's health, the health and wellbeing of family members and the provision of care. Among physical health consequences, reduced nutrition intake, decreased activities of daily living and increased physical pain and symptoms were reported. Among mental health consequences for the patient, loneliness, depressive symptoms, agitation, aggression, reduced cognitive ability and overall dissatisfaction were observed. For family members, worry, anxiety and uncertainty occurred, and they reported an increased need for information from care providers. Family members of neonatal intensive care unit patients reported less bonding with their child and family relation disturbances due to the restrictions. For care providers, visiting restrictions added the burdens of ethical dilemmas, learning new technical means to enable social interaction and an increased demand for communication with families and providing social support to both family members and patients. CONCLUSIONS: When implementing visiting restrictions in health care services, decision makers and nurses need to be aware of their potential negative effects and adapt the provision of care to compensate for such effects. Nurses in all sectors should be aware that visiting restrictions may affect patients, families, and health care services for longer than the actual pandemic.

We find that the net effects can be divided into three phases. In the first week, the benefits are not guaranteed unless the total number of contamination cases is less than some threshold values, ie if the spread of the virus is not already advanced. Then, indirect effects are revealed. After three weeks, we observe a reduction in the number of the new confirmed viral cases and, thus, the direct net benefits are observed.

Regarding the principle of appropriate and accurate prescriptions, female medical students had less knowledge (odds ratio (OR) = 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25C0.99; p = 0.050). Year-IV and Year-V medical students had more excellent knowledge than Year-III students regarding confidence in potential antibiotic prescribing once qualified. Year-V students also showed an appreciably higher confidence in the broad principles of prescribing, including antibiotics for infectious diseases, compared to those in other years. Conclusion: Overall, medical students gain more knowledge and confidence regarding the potential prescribing of antimicrobials as their academic careers progress. This is important given concerns with the current excessive use of antimicrobials in Malaysia.","output":"Antimicrobial Prescribing Confidence and Knowledge Regarding Drug Resistance: Perception of Medical Students in Malaysia and the Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of significant changes in urinary peptides may enable improved understanding of molecular disease mechanisms.

Telehealth was rapidly implemented in many countries, both phone and video based, with little time for training or attention to optimising the patient experience. Early feedback in Australia revealed many areas of patient satisfaction, but also significant technical and communication issues, along with concerns about the inability to perform physical examinations. Phone consultations were also perceived by patients to be inferior to video-based interactions [1]. The Pam McLean Centre was approached by Australian medical and nursing organisations to develop training in the optimal use of video-based telehealth for supporting breast cancer patients. This was rolled out via a Zoom platform, and included an actor trained to play the role of an Advanced Breast Cancer Patient receiving bad news. Content drew upon our previous experience in face-to-face workshop settings (e.g., use of the SPIKES protocol [2], supplemented by insights from performance and film technique. Methods to convey information with clarity and empathy were a particular focus, as video can inhibit the display and interpretation of non-verbal cues [3]. Discussion of the impact upon clinicians of telehealth, including Zoom fatigue, were also facilitated. Feedback from Australian clinicians emphasised the value of this form of teaching, and the workshops were adapted to international participants, and rolled out under the sponsorship of ESO/ABC Alliance.

This paper discusses the problem of poverty especially in relation to food waste. The prevention of food waste can also contribute to global poverty reduction, and the reduction of food waste is a tool for sustainable growth and competitiveness. At present, the number of people at risk of poverty and the amount of food waste are increasing at unsustainable rates. An integrated and efficient tool for the management of food, energy, and water (FEW) resources to improve FEW security via an interdisciplinary approach could help address several of the most significant global challenges, such as climate change, and economic, environmental, and social security. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the existence of poverty and the treatment of food for sustainable growth. The analysis focused on the EU countries and the main data source was the Eurostat database. Households generally create the largest proportion of food waste. Pareto analysis shows that in households, food and non-alcoholic beverages are among the first group of expenses, and in the EU countries they represent approximately 12% of the total expenses. Food and non-alcoholic beverages are a stable, unavoidable, and non-negligible element of total expenses. Paradoxically, enormous amounts of food are wasted. A relatively weak inversely proportional relationship between the amount of food waste per capita and the proportion of the population at risk of poverty among the total population of EU countries was identified through correlational analysis. A very weak relationship between the share of the population at risk of poverty in the total population and the amount of food waste per capita, excluding the population at risk of poverty, was also found.","output":"Effective Management Tools for Solving the Problem of Poverty in Relation to Food Waste in Context of Integrated Management of Energy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have shown that a ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle significantly decreases VAP rates.

Our aim was to describe rates of return to work versus unemployment following coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care admission. DESIGN: Single-center, prospective case series. SETTING: Critical Care Follow-Up Clinic, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy. PATIENTS: One-hundred one consecutive laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients were discharged from our hospital following an ICU stay between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Twenty-five died in the ICU. Seventy-six were discharged alive from hospital. Two patients refused participation, while three were unreachable. The remaining 71 were alive at 6 months and interviewed. INTERVENTIONS: Baseline and outcome healthcare data were extracted from the electronic patient records. Employment data were collected using a previously published structured interview instrument that included current and previous employment status, hours worked per week, and timing of return to work. Health-related quality of life status was assessed using the Italian EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 71 interviewed patients, 45 (63%) were employed prior to coronavirus disease 2019, of which 40 (89%) of them worked full-time. Thirty-three (73%) of the previously employed survivors had returned to work by 6 months, 10 (22%) were unemployed, and 2 (5%) were newly retired. Among those who returned to work, 20 (85%) of them reported reduced effectiveness at work. Those who did not return to work were either still on sick leave or lost their job as a consequence of coronavirus disease 2019. Reported quality of life of survivors not returning to work was worse than of those returning to work. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of coronavirus disease 2019 survivors following ICU in our cohort had returned to work by 6 months of follow-up. However, most of them reported reduced work effectiveness.

By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations;the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16.Methods: We analysed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms;viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons;reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages.Findings: During January 19CApril 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks;16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 110, 95% CI: 103-117, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models estimated a 70-78% reduction in transmission for 7-day vs. 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). Results were similar for 14-day voyages. All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission.Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020.

Our analyses of 22 traditional satellite markets in Kumasi are distilled into four key findings. First, these markets emerge along, and at the intersection of, intra- and inter-urban road networks as a means of granting local access to indigenous goods and services. Second, the spatial distribution and spheres of influence of the markets partly support Christaller's hypothesis regarding the willingness of people to travel far distances to access higher-order goods and services. The hypothesis fails, however, to recognize that some traditional markets can still have high spheres of influence without providing higher-order goods and services because they constitute vital nodes in the rural-urban food networks. Third, we find a spatial clustering of these markets, suggesting agglomerative tendencies among the markets. Finally, we argue that the observed spatio-social patterns of Kumasi's retailscape only make sense if they are situated within the city's modernist urban planning imaginaries.

Methods: Classification and regression trees (CART) recursive partitioning created a decision tree classifying enrollees into laboratory-confirmed cases and non-cases. Demographic and symptom data from patients ages 18-87 years who were enrolled from March 29-April 26, 2020 were included. Presence or absence of SARSCoV2 was the target variable. Results: Of 736 tested, 55 were positive for SARS-CoV2. Cases significantly more often reported chills, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea, fever, nausea/vomiting and contact with a COVID-19 case, but less frequently reported shortness of breath and sore throat. A 7-terminal node tree with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 53%, and an AUC of 78% was developed. The positive predictive value for this tree was 14% while the negative predictive value was 99%. Almost half (44%) of the participants could be ruled out as likely non-cases without testing. Discussion: Among those referred for testing, negative responses to three questions could classify about half of tested persons with low risk for SARS-CoV2 and would save limited testing resources.

METHOD Forty-one OSWs participated in a cross-sectional survey addressing multiple facets of their psychosocial care for parents with advanced cancer. The five assessed domains of psychosocial support were communication support, emotional support, household support, illness and treatment decision-making support, and end-of-life planning. RESULTS Participants reported greatest confidence in counseling patients on communication with children about illness and providing support to co-parents about parenting concerns. OSWs reported less confidence in counseling parents on end-of-life issues and assisting families with non-traditional household structures.

In this study, we examine how maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma history relate to mothers beliefs and intentions about the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children. METHODS: A total of 240 mothers with a mental health history participating in a parenting study answered online survey questions via Prolific. Questions assessed: (a) trauma indictors (past diagnosis, current symptoms, and lifetime exposure to events); (b) vaccine measures (intentions for self and child, COVID-19 vaccine confidence, general vaccine perceived safety, reasoning about vaccine intentions, sources of influence on intentions); and (c) possible explanatory variables (institutional distrust, negative worldviews). ANCOVAs and regression analyses were used. RESULTS: When compared with mothers with other mental health diagnoses, mothers with a PTSD history had significantly less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and less intent to get the vaccine for themselves or their child. These effects were explained by greater institutional distrust (i.e., significant indirect effects). Mothers with a previous PTSD diagnosis also expressed different reasons for vaccine hesitancy (e.g., less belief in science) and ascribed less influence to healthcare and governmental sources in vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential utility of a trauma-informed approach in efforts to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

The South East Asian Therapeutic Plasma exchange Consortium (SEATPEC) was formed in 2018 to promote education and research on TPE within the region. The advent of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic has produced challenges for the development and expansion of this service. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative and semi\\\\quantitative questionnaire\\\\based survey was conducted by SEATPEC member countries from January to June 2020 (Phase 1) and then from July 2020 to January 2021 in (Phase 2) to assess the impact of Covid\\\\19 on regional TPE. OBJECTIVES: The study's main objectives were to explore the challenges experienced and adaptations/adjustments taken by SEATPEC countries in order to continue safe and efficient TPE during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: The pandemic was found to disrupt the delivery of TPE services in all SEATPEC countries. Contributing factors were multifactorial due to overstretched medical services, staff shortages, quarantines and redeployments, fear of acquiring Covid\\\\19, movement restriction orders, and patient's psychological fear of attending hospitals/testing for Covid\\\\19.

We develop mathematical models based on competing hypotheses regarding this link, thereby providing different prevalence estimates based on case numbers, and validate them by predicting SARS-CoV-2-attributed death rate trajectories. Assuming that individuals were tested based solely on a predefined risk of being infectious implies the absolute case numbers reflect the prevalence, but turned out to be a poor predictor, consistently overestimating growth rates at the beginning of two COVID-19 epidemic waves. In contrast, assuming that testing capacity is fully exploited performs better.

However, spontaneous breathing (SB) efforts can produce entrained \\"M-wave\\" airway pressure waveforms that inhibit identification of accurate values for respiratory system elastance and airway resistance. A pressure wave reconstruction method is proposed to accurately identify respiratory mechanics, assess the level of SB effort, and quantify the incidence of SB effort without uncommon measuring devices or interruption to care. METHODS Data from 275 breaths aggregated from all mechanically ventilated patients at Christchurch Hospital were used in this study. The breath specific respiratory elastance is calculated using a time-varying elastance model. A pressure reconstruction method is proposed to reconstruct pressure waves identified as being affected by SB effort. The area under the curve of the time-varying respiratory elastance (AUC Edrs) are calculated and compared, where unreconstructed waves yield lower AUC Edrs. The difference between the reconstructed and unreconstructed pressure is denoted as a surrogate measure of SB effort. RESULTS The pressure reconstruction method yielded a median AUC Edrs of 19.21 [IQR: 16.30-22.47]cmH2Os/l. In contrast, the median AUC Edrs for unreconstructed M-wave data was 20.41 [IQR: 16.68-22.81]cmH2Os/l. The pressure reconstruction method had the least variability in AUC Edrs assessed by the robust coefficient of variation (RCV)=0.04 versus 0.05 for unreconstructed data. Each patient exhibited different levels of SB effort, independent from MV setting, indicating the need for non-invasive, real time assessment of SB effort. CONCLUSION A simple reconstruction method enables more consistent real-time estimation of the true, underlying respiratory system mechanics of a SB patient and provides the surrogate of SB effort, which may be clinically useful for clinicians in determining optimal ventilator settings to improve patient care.","output":"Assessing respiratory mechanics using pressure reconstruction method in mechanically ventilated spontaneous breathing patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this meta-analysis of observational studies was to evaluate the association between simple renal cysts (SRC) and presence of aortic pathology such as aortic aneurysms and dissection.

If the salvage value of the product is relatively low, the seller has less opportunity to benefit from online reviews when it offers an MBG, as compared to a no-refund policy. The impact of online reviews on the competition between the two sellers has a symmetric effect area, where reviews may either weaken or intensify the price competition between the two sellers when they both offer a no-refund policy, but always intensify the competition if they both offer an MBG. We have identified the conditions under which online reviews lead to a win-win, or benefit one seller, or present a prisoner's dilemma for the two online sellers.

The results indicated that water pollution and associated human health risk reduced by an average of 30% and 39%, respectively, during the lockdown period. In addition, the multi-purpose water quality index also improved by an average of 34%. However, the water salinity and alkalinity increased during the lockdown period due to the increase of municipal wastewater and the use of disinfectants. The major sources of pollution were identified as weathering, municipal wastewater, industrial and agricultural effluents, solid waste, and vehicular pollution. PCA-MLR receptor model showed that the contribution of mixed sources of weathering and municipal wastewater in water pollution increased from 23 to 50% during the lockdown period.

This studys objectives were to validate an Arabic-language version of the SOGS and assess factors associated with probable pathological gambling among Lebanese adults. METHODS: This study was carried out between February and April 2021, during the lockdown period imposed by the Lebanese government. A total of 601 individuals participated in this study by filling the online questionnaire. RESULTS: A factor analysis, using the principal component analysis, was performed on the SOGS scale items. The SOGS items were able to explain 73.35% of the variance, with an internal reliability of KR20 = 0.947 for the total scale.

Two potential targets, the spike protein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from PDB have been used for molecular docking. All the selected drugs were docked with both targets and demonstrated strong hydrogen bond (HB) interactions in multiple active sites. Amongst these, the range of binding energy was from 3-7 kcal/mol for spike protein and 2-8 kcal/mol for the main protease. Upon comparison of all the processed drugs ganciclovir and zanamivir displayed significant binding energy with HB interactions with both, spike (-9.2 and -9 kcal/mol respectively) and the main protease (-9 kcal/mol). Ribavirin and tenofovir showed significant binding energy above -8 kcal/mol with seven HB interactions with the main protease and also spike protein.

Patient outcomes were classified as mild disease, hospitalization and severe disease (death or documented treatment in an intensive-care unit). Chi-square test was applied to examine the association between each mutation and patient outcome. False discovery rate was computed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing and results passing FDR cutoff of 5% were accepted as significant. RESULTS: Mutations were mapped to amino acid changes for 3,733 non-silent mutations. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in ORF3a, NSP3, ORF6 and N.

However, health systems have not given up and have become resilient by adapting interesting strategies to overcome these obstacles. The private health sector has also stepped up to the occasion by supporting national TB programs through innovative approaches. The scientific community has laid down several evidence-based recommendations to help TB programs get back on track. Its time to unite these forces to not just overcome the challenge posed by the pandemic but also to build a more resilient health system.","output":"TB and COVID - Public and private health sectors adapt to a new reality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hydrophobic gadolinium-based magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) was investigated for the first time as an extraction solvent in dispersive liquidCliquid microextraction (DLLME). The tested MIL was composed of trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium cations and paramagnetic gadolinium chloride anions. The prepared MIL showed low water miscibility, reasonable viscosity, markedly high magnetic susceptibility, adequate chemical stability, low UV background, and compatibility with reversed-phase HPLC solvents. These features resulted in a more efficient extraction than the corresponding iron or manganese analogues. Accordingly, the overall method sensitivity and reproducibility were improved, and the analysis time was reduced. The applicability of the proposed MIL was examined through the microextraction of four sartan antihypertensive drugs from aqueous samples followed by reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection at 240 nm. The DLLME procedures were optimized for disperser solvent type, MIL mass, disperser solvent volume, as well as acid, base, and salt addition. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) obtained with the analysis of 1.2-mL samples after DLLME and HPLC were 80, 30, 40, and 160 ng/mL for azilsartan medoxomil, irbesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan, respectively. Correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9988 and RSD values were in the range of 2.48C4.07%. Under the optimized microextraction conditions and using a 5-mL sample volume, enrichment factors were raised from about 40 for all sartans using a 1.2-mL sample to 175, 176, 169, and 103 for azilsartan medoxomil, irbesartan, valsartan, and telmisartan, respectively. The relative extraction recoveries for the studied sartans in river water varied from 82.5 to 101.48% at a spiked concentration of 0.5 g/mL for telmisartan and irbesartan and 1 g/mL for azilsartan medoxomil and valsartan.

Worldwide, around 116 million cases and 2.57 million deaths are reported with new cases and increasing mortality every day. To date, there is no specific commercial treatment to control the infection. Repurpose drugs targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor represents an alternative strategy to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and forestall virus adhesion, internalization, and replication in the host cell. Methods: We performed a rigid molecular docking using the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of S protein (RBD S1)-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1) interaction site and 1,283 drugs FDA approved. The docking score, frequency of the drug in receptor site, and interactions at the binding site residues were used as analyzing criteria. Results: This research yielded 40 drugs identified as a potential inhibitor of RBD S1-ACE2 interaction. Among the inhibitors, compounds such as ipratropium, formoterol, and fexofenadine can be found. Specialists employ these drugs as therapies to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and virtually any respiratory infection. Conclusions: Our results will serve as the basis for in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the potential use of those drugs to generate affordable and convenient therapies to treat COVID-19.","output":"Identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-ACE2 interaction by in silico drug repurposing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT.-: Diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in symptomatic and asymptomatic children remains integral to care, particularly for supporting return to and attendance in schools. The concordance of SARS-CoV-2 detection in children using various specimen types has not been widely studied. OBJECTIVE.-: To compare three sample types for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in children collected and tested at a single facility. DESIGN.-: We prospectively recruited 142 symptomatic and asymptomatic children into a sample comparison study performed in a single healthcare system. Each child provided self-collected saliva, and a trained healthcare provider collected a mid-turbinate nasal swab and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Specimens were assayed within 24 hours of collection using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 on a single testing platform. RESULTS.-: Concurrently collected saliva and mid-turbinate swabs had >95% positive agreement with NP swabs when obtained within 10 days of symptom onset. Positive agreement of saliva and mid-turbinate samples collected from children with symptom onset >10 days prior, or without symptoms, was 82% compared to NP swab samples. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for mid-turbinate nasal samples more closely correlated with Ct values from NP samples than saliva sample Ct values. CONCLUSIONS.-: These findings suggest that all three sample types from children are useful for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by RT-PCR, and that concordance is greatest when the child has symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the past 10 days. This study provides scientific justification for utilizing sample types other than the NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing in pediatric populations.","output":"Comparison of Mid-turbinate Nasal Swabs, Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swabs for SARSCoV-2 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Testing in Pediatric Outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the association between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and private firms corporate donations. Based on resource constraints and the conservation of resources (COR) theory, we argue that private firms are constantly facing resource constraints and their resource conservation motive becomes apparent when EPU is heightened.

Using audited corporate donations from 48,903 private firms in Korea during 2002C2019, we find that private firms donations are negatively related to EPU. We find that private firms operating in more competitive conditions increase their donations, but this positive association between market competition and donations is moderated by EPU. We find that private firms donations increased when the progressive party is in power, but this positive relationship is also moderated by EPU. Our results suggest that firms reduce their level of corporate giving to conserve resources as a precautionary saving motive when they face higher EPU.

METHODS: A review of the literature and understanding of facial anatomy and expressions as well as the effect of botulinum toxin on emotions and nonverbal communication. RESULTS: Today, the mask has become a semi-permanent accessory to the face, blocking our ability to express and perceive each other's facial expressions by dividing it into a visible top half and invisible bottom half. This significantly restricts our ability to accurately interpret emotions based on facial expressions and strengthens our perceptions of negative emotions produced by frowning. The addition of botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced facial muscle paralysis to target the muscles of the top (visible) half of the face, especially the corrugator and procerus muscles, may act as a therapeutic solution by its suppression of glabellar lines and our ability to frown. The treatment of the glabella complex not only has been shown to inhibit the negative emotions of the treated individual but also can reduce the negative emotions in those who come in contact with the treated individual. CONCLUSIONS: Mask-wearing in the wake of COVID-19 brings new challenges to our ability to communicate and perceive emotion through full facial expression, our most effective and universally shared form of communication, and BTX may offer a positive solution to decrease negative emotions and promote well-being for both the mask-wearer and all who come in contact with that individual.","output":"\\"Masking\\" our emotions: Botulinum toxin, facial expression, and well-being in the age of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brugada syndrome (BrS), a type of sudden arrhythmic unexpected death syndrome (SADS), is characterized by specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, a structurally normal heart, and susceptibility to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

Our indicator is based on the chronology of stage-by-stage progress of individual vaccines and related news. We construct a general equilibrium regime-switching model of repeated pandemics and stages of vaccine progress wherein the representative agent withdraws labor and alters consumption endogenously to mitigate health risk. The value of a cure in the resulting asset-pricing framework is intimately linked to the relative labor supply across states. The observed stock market response to vaccine progress serves to identify this quantity, allowing us to use the model to estimate the economy-wide welfare gain that would be attributable to a cure. In our estimation, and with standard preference parameters, the value of the ability to end the pandemic is worth 5-15% of total wealth. This value rises substantially when there is uncertainty about the frequency and duration of pandemics. Agents place almost as much value on the ability to resolve the uncertainty as they do on the value of the cure itself. This effect is stronger C not weaker C when agents have a preference for later resolution of uncertainty.

A decade of high-throughput sequencing-based investigations into the genomic basis of migration points to an integrative framework that incorporates quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, phenotypic plasticity, and epigenetics to explain migration evolution. In this perspective, I argue that the transcontinental migration of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can serve as a compelling system to study the mechanism of evolutionary lability of a complex trait. Monarchs show significant phenotypic and genotypic diversity across their global range, with phenotypic switching that allows for explicit study of evolutionary lability. A developmental approach for elucidating how migratory traits are generated and functionally integrated will be important for understanding the evolution of monarch migration traits. I propose a plasticity threshold model to describe migration lability, and I describe novel functional techniques that will help resolve open questions and model assumptions. I conclude by considering the relationships between adaptive genetic architecture, anthropogenic climate change, and conservation management practice and the timeliness of the monarch migration model to illuminate these connections given the rapid decline of the North American migration.","output":"Monarch Butterfly Migration as an Integrative Model of Complex Trait Evolution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic crisis motivated researchers worldwide to deeply investigate it from different perspectives.

We evaluated the effects of one of the largest primary health-care programmes in the world, the Brazilian Family Health Strategy (FHS), on tuberculosis morbidity and mortality using a nationwide cohort of 73 million individuals over a 10-year study period. METHODS: We analysed individuals who entered the 100 Million Brazilians Cohort during the period Jan 1, 2004, to Dec 31, 2013, and compared residents in municipalities with no FHS coverage with residents in municipalities with full FHS coverage. We used a cohort design with multivariable Poisson regressions, adjusted for all relevant demographic and socioeconomic variables and weighted with inverse probability of treatment weighting, to estimate the effect of FHS on tuberculosis incidence, mortality, cure, and case fatality. We also performed a range of stratifications and sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: FHS exposure was associated with lower tuberculosis incidence (rate ratio [RR] 078, 95% CI 072C084) and mortality (072, 055C094), and was positively associated with tuberculosis cure rates (104, 100C108). FHS was also associated with a decrease in tuberculosis case-fatality rates, although this was not statistically significant (RR 084, 95% CI 055C130). FHS associations were stronger among the poorest individuals for all the tuberculosis indicators. INTERPRETATION: Community-based primary health care could strongly reduce tuberculosis morbidity and mortality and decrease the unequal distribution of the tuberculosis burden in the most vulnerable populations. During the current marked rise in global poverty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in primary health care could help protect against the expected increases in tuberculosis incidence worldwide and contribute to the attainment of the End TB Strategy goals.

The broadening implementation of lung cancer screening has resulted in positive findings in numerous patients that are mostly non-malignant. Many other patients have indeterminate nodules that are difficult to assess through simple observation. The critical interpretation of such screening results remains a challenge for radiologists and multidisciplinary teams involved in screening for lung cancer. The evaluation and diagnosis of each participant suspected for malignancy should be based on the basic clinical principles such as a carefully collected medical history, physical examination, and detailed analysis of all imaging tests performed. Indeed, the decision to go ahead with more invasive diagnostics requires consideration of the both the risks and benefits, with reflection upon the complete clinical and radiological picture. Although transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy remains the first-choice method of diagnosis, several newer technologies have slowly begun to emerge as potential replacements. The guiding strategy for method selection is to choose the least harmful approach that offers the most relevant potential insights. Transthoracic biopsy is an effective method that allows the collection of cytological and tissue material from small, peripheral tumors, but it carries a moderate risk of complications. Bronchofiberoscopy, especially in combination with electromagnetic navigation, fluoroscopy or radial EBUS, also allows effective diagnosis of the peripheral pulmonary nodules. One of the most important diagnostic methods is the EBUS examination, which allows determining of staging in addition to diagnosis. Anatomical lung lobe resection and lymphadenectomy or sampling of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is currently the treatment of choice for patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but sublobar resections are recommended when a patient has limited pulmonary function or other significant comorbidities. Notably, several studies have highlighted the potential utility of more limited resections in small malignant lesions less than 2cm in diameter, with pure AIS histology, when more than 50% of the diameter of pulmonary nodule has ground-glass opacity (GGO) attenuation on CT, or long volume doubling time (VDT). Videothoracoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for resection of early-stage lung cancer. Patients who are not candidates for surgery or do not agree to surgery can be offered radical radiotherapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a type of radical radiotherapy with proven effectiveness, a high rate of local control and an acceptable risk of the development of later complications.

However, an optimized method for its detection in sewage has not yet been adequately investigated. Therefore, in this study, the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the solid fraction of wastewater was investigated using two quantitative PCR assays. In particular, wastewater samples were collected from a manhole located in the commercial district of a metropolitan region in Japan, where COVID-19 is highly prevalent, and two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The samples were concentrated using four separate methods, namely, electronegative membrane adsorption, polyethylene glycol precipitation, ultrafiltration, and solid precipitation. Each method revealed a significant concentration of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, which is an indicator virus for wastewater. As expected, non-enveloped PMMoV RNA was enriched in the supernatant fraction such that relatively low concentrations were detected in the solid fraction of the wastewater samples. In contrast, higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were consistently detected in the solid fractions compared with the supernatant fractions based on the other methods that were investigated in this study. Spearman's correlation tests showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater samples from the WWTP were significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases recorded during the data collection period.

ABSTRACT: Hydrogen gas (H(2)), as a signaling molecule, has been reported to be involved in plant growth and development. Here, the effect of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on the formation of bulblets and adventitious roots in the scale cuttings of Lilium davidii var. unicolor and its mechanisms at the molecular levels were investigated. The results revealed that compared with distilled water treatment (Con), the number of bulblets and adventitious roots were significantly promoted by different concentrations of HRW treatment. Treatment with 100% HRW obtained the most positive effects. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis found that compared with Con, a total of 1702 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, upregulated 552 DEGs, downregulated 1150 DEGs) were obtained under HRW treatment. The sucrose and starch metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism were significantly enriched in the analysis of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). In addition, the genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were significantly upregulated or downregulated (upregulated 22 DEGs, downregulated 15 DEGs), indicating that starch and sucrose metabolism held a central position. The expressions of 12 DEGs were identified as coding for key enzymes in metabolism of carbohydrates was validated by qPCR during bulblet formation progress. RNA-seq analysis and expression profiles indicated that the unigene levels such as glgc, Susy, otsA and glgP, BMY and TPS were well correlated with sucrose and starch metabolism during HRW-induced bulblet formation. The change of key enzyme content in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway was explored during bulblet formation in Lilium under HRW treatment. Meanwhile, compared with Con, 100% HRW treatment increased the levels of sucrose and starch, and decreased the trehalose content, which were agreed with the expression pattern of DEGs related to the biosynthesis pathway of sucrose, starch and trehalose. Therefore, this study suggested that HRW could promote the accumulation of sucrose and starch contents in mother scales, and decreased the trehalose content, this might provide more energy for bulblet formation.

To date, the spike protein has become the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Experimental reports have described the heterogeneity of the spike protein glycosylation profile. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, there are no studies to date on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology. Building an understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor binding affinity revealed the regulatory effects of the RBD glycans. Remarkably, opposite effects were observed from differently remodeled glycans, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor binding affinity. Overall, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond this study, enzymatic remodeling of glycosylation offers the opportunity to understand the fundamental role of specific glycoforms on glycoconjugates across molecular biology. Covert art Legends The glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain has regulatory effects on the receptor binding affinity. Sialylation or not determines the stabilizing or destabilizing effect of the glycans. (Protein structure model is adapted from Protein Data Bank: 6moj. The original model does not contain the glycan structure.) Significance Glycans extensively cover the surface of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein but the relationships between the glycan structures and the protein pathological behaviors remain elusive. Herein, we simplified and harmonized the glycan structures in the S protein receptor-binding domain and reported their regulatory roles in human receptor interaction. Opposite regulatory effects were observed and were determined by discrete glycan structures, which can be neutralized by the reported S309 antibody binding to the S protein. This report provides new insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 S protein infection as well as S309 neutralization.","output":"Structural remodeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein glycans reveals the regulatory roles in receptor binding affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is going through an unprecedented medical emergency with no effective remedy for the SARS-CoV2 virus causing Covid-19.
