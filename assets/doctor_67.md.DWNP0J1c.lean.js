This study was designed to examine the effects of sorafenib on macrophages, the major ontogeny of innate immunity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Macrophages were derived from sorted CD14(+) monocytes of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cell viability and surface antigens were examined by trypan blue analysis. Autophagy was characterized by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for morphology, Western blotting for microtubule associated light chain protein 3B (LC-3B) I lipidation, and acridine orange staining for acidic component vacuoles. Soluble factors contained in culture medium and serum were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: We found that sorafenib inhibited the viability of macrophages accompanied by morphological changes characteristic of autophagy. This autophagy-inducing effect was validated by LC3B-I lipidation and autophagosome accumulation. The surface antigen expression and the function of activated macrophages were inhibited by sorafenib, including the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. The secretion of IL-10, but not IL-6, TNF- nor TGF-, was reduced by sorafenib.

We previously reported that NLS mutation in the matrix (M) protein obviously attenuates the replication and pathogenicity of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), but the attenuated replication mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we showed that M/NLS mutation not only disrupted Ms nucleocytoplasmic trafficking characteristic but also impaired viral RNA synthesis and transcription. Using TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis of BSR-T7/5 cells infected with the parental NDV rSS1GFP and the mutant NDV rSS1GFP-M/NLSm harboring M/NLS mutation, we found that rSS1GFP infection stimulated much greater quantities and more expression changes of differentially expressed proteins involved in host cell transcription, ribosomal structure, posttranslational modification, and intracellular trafficking than rSS1GFP-M/NLSm infection. Further in-depth analysis revealed that the dominant nuclear accumulation of M protein inhibited host cell transcription, RNA processing and modification, protein synthesis, posttranscriptional modification and transport; and this kind of inhibition could be weakened when most of M protein was confined outside the nucleus. More importantly, we found that the function of M protein in the cytoplasm effected the inhibition of TIFA expression in a dose-dependent manner, and promoted NDV replication by down-regulating TIFA/TRAF6/NF-B-mediated production of cytokines. It was the first report about the involvement of M protein in NDV immune evasion. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NDV replication is closely related to the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of M protein, which accelerates our understanding of the molecular functions of NDV M protein.","output":"TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis reveals the attenuated replication mechanism of Newcastle disease virus caused by nuclear localization signal mutation in viral matrix protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children with fragile X syndrome and William Beuren syndrome share several socio-communicative deficits.

BACKGROUND A single case report of a daily persistent headache associated with nutcracker syndrome was recently published. As the left renal vein has a connection to the spinal lumbar veins and secondarily to the spinal epidural venous plexus, one could hypothesize that renal vein compression could lead to persistent headache by altering spinal and cerebral venous pressure with secondary alterations in CSF pressure. The authors have published on a series of patients with a unique subtype of daily persistent headache from onset that appears to be caused by an abnormal reset of CSF pressure to an elevated state. The goal of the present study was to look for the presence of nutcracker physiology in this unique patient subgroup and to propose a pathogenesis model utilizing a novel MRI protocol to evaluate for retrograde lumbar vein flow and regional spinal epidural venous plexus congestion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Case series of patients with a daily persistent headache from onset, head pressure, and whose headaches worsened in the Trendelenburg position. Patients were imaged with a 3 T MRI in the supine position from the lower diaphragm to the top of the pelvis with a dynamic angiogram centered over the left L2 lumbar vein. RESULTS 12 patients were studied of which 8 were positive for left renal vein compression, lumbar vein dilation and early spinal epidural venous plexus enhancement. All were women. Mean age of headache onset was 39 years. Six of the 8 patients had a lumbar puncture, and all had a normal opening pressure. All improved with CSF volume removal although pain resolution lasted from hours to 6 months. The patient's headaches were marked by holocranial pressure and the majority displayed migrainous associated symptoms although none had a prior headache history. They did not complain of typical symptoms or signs of nutcracker syndrome. CONCLUSION We suggest that patients with a daily persistent headache from onset who worsen in the Trendelenburg position may have underlying nutcracker physiology. From our imaging findings, it can be hypothesized that left renal vein compression leads to retrograde flow through the valveless lumbar vein which then leads to spinal epidural venous congestion and subsequently causes congestion of the cerebral venous system leading to an elevation of CSF pressure and to a daily headache. What appears to be unique about these patients is that a daily headache is their only manifestation of nutcracker physiology.","output":"Nutcracker phenomenon with a daily persistent headache as the primary symptom: Case series and a proposed pathogenesis model based on a novel MRI technique to evaluate for spinal epidural venous congestion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is taking a mental toll on students as they plan for college, but college admission counselors say connections can ease uncertainty A survey released in late July by Junior Achievement (JA) indicated that among students from 13-17 years of age, two-thirds were worried about attending school in-person this fall, with nearly 40 percent having said they were \\"extremely concerned\\" or \\"very concerned \\" About 70 percent said their parents are worried About one quarter of the young people responding said they were concerned \\"that their dreams won't come true,\\" and a similar number felt they might not be able to have job or career that will pay enough","output":"Amplified Anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract (249 words) Background Zimbabwe suffers from regular outbreaks of typhoid fever (TF), worse since 2017.

Typhi in children six months to 15 years and in individuals six months to 45 years in Harare. Methods A matched case-control study was conducted in three urban suburbs of Harare targeted by the TCV vaccination campaign. Suspected TF cases were enrolled prospectively in four health facilities and were matched to facility (1:1) and community (1:5) controls. Findings Of 504 suspected cases from July 2019 to March 2020, 148 laboratory-confirmed TF cases and 153 controls confirmed-negative were identified. One hundred and five (47 aged six months to 15 years) cases were age, sex, and residence matched with 105 facility-based controls while 96 cases were matched 1:5 by age, sex, and immediate-neighbour with 229 community controls. The adjusted VE against confirmed TF was 75% (95%CI: 1-94, p=0.049) compared to facility controls, and 84% (95%CI: 57-94, p<0.001) compared to community controls in individuals six months to 15 years.

Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, was approved as an alternative treatment for severe COVID-19 patients despite limited real-world clinical data in China. In the present study, we will discuss and evaluate the treatment response of TCZ therapy in patients with COVID-19. The clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory parameters of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte counts before and after TCZ therapy, and clinical outcomes in the 13 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated according to the related medical records. The results showed that 13 patients with COVID-19 were totally included in this study. One of them was moderately ill, 8 were seriously ill, and 4 were critically ill. Eleven patients received TCZ administration once, while the other 2 patients received it twice. The median level of IL-6 before TCZ administration was 27.91 (7.42C210.90) pg/mL. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spike firstly and then gradually decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in 2 patients who were finally dead. The CRP levels of 76.92% (10/13) of the patients were above the normal range before the start of TCZ therapy and gradually declined after the TCZ treatment. No. 1 and No. 10 patients finally died accompanied by the corresponding lymphocyte counts persistently dropping. No. 13 patient became exacerbated possibly due to inducing severe bacterial infection after TCZ treatment, while the other 10 patients showed clinical improvement. In summary, the study revealed that TCZ may have a certain therapeutic effect on severe COVID-19 patients with a risk of the cytokine storm.

This flow-diversion device is being used in Europe for intracranial aneurysm treatment by aneurysm occlusion. The device construct creates an intracranial bypass conduit that reconstructs the parent vessel while maintaining patency of the perforating arteries and branch arteries. The investigators report the first two patients in which the SILK stent was used for intracranial aneurysms in the United States. CASE DESCRIPTION Two patients, one with a symptomatic giant posterior communicating artery aneurysm and one with a symptomatic fusiform vertebrobasilar junction and basilar artery aneurysm, were treated at two separate institutions with the device. A total of three SILK stents were placed in these patients. In the first patient, a single device was sufficient to cause immediate angiographic stasis within the posterior communicating artery aneurysm. However, reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy was required due to a spontaneous bleed from an intercostal artery, and this led to in-stent thrombosis and major stroke. In the second patient, the placement of two devices resulted in immediate stasis of the basilar artery aneurysm. The patient remained on antiplatelet therapy and was discharged without complication. His follow-up angiogram at approximately 2 months showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm with parent vessel reconstruction. In both patients, immediate stasis was identified, and no immediate neurological complications occurred. However, in one patient, a complication occurred that was related to reversal of/cessation of antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSION In this initial U.S. experience with SILK flow-diversion devices, these devices were deployed easily and immediate flow stasis in the aneurysm was achieved.

METHODS This retrospective study included 2,476 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 4 Massachusetts hospitals between March 11 and May 21, 2020. Patients were stratified by a history of either cancer (n=195) or CVD (n=414) and subsequently by the presence of both cancer and CVD (n=82). We compared outcomes between patients with and without cancer and patients with both cancer and CVD compared with patients with either condition alone. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-associated severe disease, defined as a composite of the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, or death. Secondary endpoints included death, shock, need for mechanical ventilation, need for supplemental oxygen, arrhythmia, venous thromboembolism, encephalopathy, abnormal troponin level, and length of stay. RESULTS Multivariable analysis identified cancer as an independent predictor of COVID-19-associated severe disease among all infected patients. Patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19-associated severe disease than were those without cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.53-2.68; P<.001). Furthermore, patients with both cancer and CVD had a higher likelihood of COVID-19-associated severe disease compared with those with either cancer (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.10; P=.02) or CVD (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.66; P=.004) alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and January 2013, a total of 10 patients underwent R-UNC in the distal ureter by a single surgeon. Indications for R-UNC were as follows: idiopathic (3), fistula (2), iatrogenic (2), malignancy (2), and chronic vesicoureteral reflux (1). RESULTS Tension-free anastomosis was attained in all 10 R-UNC procedures. A psoas hitch was performed in 6/10 cases (60%). Intravesical and extravesical reimplantations were completed in 5/10 (50%) and 5/10 cases (50%), respectively. A nonrefluxing ureter was constructed in 2/10 cases (20%). The patients' mean age was 52.916.6 years, their mean body mass index was 30.86.3 kg/m(2), the mean operative time was 211.769.3 minutes, mean estimated blood loss was 102.5110.8 mL, and mean length of stay was 2.82.3 days. There were no intraoperative complications. There was one Clavien-Dindo grade I and one Clavien-Dindo grade II postoperative complication. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 28.515.5 months. Two patients had recurrence of ureteral strictures at 3 months postoperatively and were managed successfully with balloon dilation. CONCLUSIONS Our technique for R-UNC demonstrates good perioperative outcomes.

It is evident that adopting innovative technologies such as blockchain can help in effective planning operations and resource deployments. Blockchain technology can play an important role in the healthcare sector, such as improved clinical trial data management by reducing delays in regulatory approvals, and streamline the communication between diverse stakeholders of the supply chain, etc. Moreover, the spread of misinformation has intensely increased during the outbreak, and existing platforms lack the ability to validate the authenticity of data, leading to public panic and irrational behavior. Thus, developing a blockchain-based tracking system is important to ensure that the information received by the public and government agencies is reliable and trustworthy. In this paper, we review various blockchain applications and opportunities in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and develop a tracking system for the COVID-19 data collected from various external sources. We propose, implement, and evaluate a blockchain-based system using Ethereum smart contracts and oracles to track reported data related to the number of new cases, deaths, and recovered cases obtained from trusted sources. We present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions between stakeholders in the network. We present security analysis and the cost incurred by the stakeholders, and we highlight the challenges and future directions of our work.

Particularly, it can be difficult for health care professionals to recommend a suitable app for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) education and self-monitoring purposes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze and evaluate the contents as well as features of COVID-19 mobile apps. The findings are instrumental in helping health care professionals to identify suitable mobile apps for COVID-19 self-monitoring and education. The results of the mobile apps' assessment could potentially help mobile app developers improve or modify their existing mobile app designs to achieve optimal outcomes. METHODS: The search for the mHealth apps available in the android-based Play Store and the iOS-based App Store was conducted between April 18 and May 5, 2020. The region of the App Store where we performed the search was the United States, and a virtual private network app was used to locate and access COVID-19 mobile apps from all countries on the Google Play Store. The inclusion criteria were apps that are related to COVID-19 with no restriction in language type. The basic features assessment criteria used for comparison were the requirement for free subscription, internet connection, education or advisory content, size of the app, ability to export data, and automated data entry. The functionality of the apps was assessed according to knowledge (information on COVID-19), tracing or mapping of COVID-19 cases, home monitoring surveillance, online consultation with a health authority, and official apps run by health authorities. RESULTS: Of the 223 COVID-19-related mobile apps, only 30 (19.9%) found in the App Store and 28 (44.4%) in the Play Store matched the inclusion criteria. In the basic features assessment, most App Store (10/30, 33.3%) and Play Store (10/28, 35.7%) apps scored 4 out of 7 points. Meanwhile, the outcome of the functionality assessment for most App Store apps (13/30, 43.3%) was a score of 3 compared to android-based apps (10/28, 35.7%), which scored 2 (out of the maximum 5 points). Evaluation of the basic functions showed that 75.0% (n=36) of the 48 included mobile apps do not require a subscription, 56.3% (n=27) provide symptom advice, and 41.7% (n=20) have educational content. In terms of the specific functions, more than half of the included mobile apps are official mobile apps maintained by a health authority for COVID-19 information provision. Around 37.5% (n=18) and 31.3% (n=15) of the mobile apps have tracing or mapping and home monitoring surveillance functions, respectively, with only 17% (n=8) of the mobile apps equipped with an online consultation function. CONCLUSIONS: Most iOS-based apps incorporate infographic mapping of COVID-19 cases, while most android-based apps incorporate home monitoring surveillance features instead of providing focused educational content on COVID-19. It is important to evaluate the contents and features of COVID-19 mobile apps to guide users in choosing a suitable mobile app based on their requirements.","output":"Mobile Health Apps on COVID-19 Launched in the Early Days of the Pandemic: Content Analysis and Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Freshwater scarcity, a problem that has arisen particularly as a result of the progressive environmental damage caused by human consumption patterns, is strongly associated with a loss of living quality and a drop in global socioeconomic development.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether pre-diagnosed cancer was an independent risk factor for fatal outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in major databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE to identify all published full-text studies as of January 20, 2021. Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q-statistic and I2 test. A meta-analysis of random- or fixed-effects model was used to estimate the effect size. Publication bias, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also carried out. RESULTS: The confounders-adjusted pooled effects (pooled odds ratio [OR]a?=a?1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-1.65; pooled hazard ratio [HR]a?=a?1.37, 95% CI: 1.21-1.54) indicated that COVID-19 patients with pre-diagnosed cancer were more likely to progress to fatal outcomes based on 96 articles with 6,518,992 COVID-19 patients.

PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients who underwent open partial nephrectomy for a unicentric renal tumor was performed. In 15 patients, SRBS were used for parenchymal repair during open partial nephrectomy, and in 35 patients, conventional sutures were used. The parameters related to surgical outcomes were recorded and analysis of the total patient population and subgroup analysis according to the preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical (PADUA) score classification was performed. RESULTS The preoperative baseline values did not statistically differ between the groups. Analysis of the total patient population showed a significant difference regarding ischemia time (mean  standard deviation) between the SRBS group (15.2  6.9 min), and the conventional suture group (25.7  11.8 min). There was no significant difference between the barbed and conventional sutures with regard to postoperative hemoglobin levels, decline in hemoglobin percentage, or renal function parameters. In subgroup-analysis, a significant difference in ischemia time was only found for PADUA scores 6 and 7, without any effect on the outcome parameters. CONCLUSIONS The use of SRBS in parenchymal repair during open partial nephrectomy appears to be a safe and feasible option with decreased cold ischemia time when compared with conventional sutures.

However, few studies have accounted for the nature of contagious diseases, i.e., their dependent happenings. Aim We aimed to quantify the impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. We employed two epidemiological measurements of transmissibility and severity: the effective reproduction number (Rt) and case fatality risk (CFR). Methods We used empirical surveillance data and meteorological data in Tokyo to estimate the Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR and to subsequently assess the nonlinear and delay effect of temperature on Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Results For Rt at low temperatures, the cumulative relative risk (RR) at first temperature percentile (3.3) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.7). As for the virulence to humans, moderate cold temperatures were associated with higher CFR, and CFR also increased as the temperature rose. The cumulative RR at the 10th and 99th percentiles of temperature (5.8 and 30.8) for CFR were 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-10) and 6.4 (95%CI: 4.1-10.1). Conclusions This study provided information on the effects of temperature on the COVID-19 epidemiology using Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Our results suggest the importance to take precautions to avoid infection in both cold and warm seasons to avoid severe cases of COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis and content analysis based on an online survey among clinicians, researchers, and organizations. Our data were extracted from multiple-choice questions on access to SRHR services and risk of SRHR violations, and written responses to open-ended questions on threats to access and required response. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 51 people representing 29 countries. Eighty-six percent reported that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of COVID-19, corresponding figures for surgical and medical abortion were 62% and 46%. The increased risk of gender-based and sexual violence was assessed as moderate or severe by 79%. Among countries with mildly restrictive abortion policies, 69% had implemented changes to facilitate access to abortion during the pandemic, compared with none among countries with severe restrictions (P < .001), 87.5% compared with 46% had implemented changes to facilitate access to contraception (P = .023). The content analysis showed that (a) prioritizations in health service delivery at the expense of SRHR, (b) lack of political will, (c) the detrimental effect of lockdown, and (d) the suspension of sexual education, were threats to SRHR access (theme 1). Requirements to mitigate these threats (theme 2) were (a) political will and support of universal access to SRH services, (b) the sensitization of providers, (c) free public transport, and (d) physical protective equipment. A contrasting third theme was the state of exception of the COVID-19 pandemic as a window of opportunity to push forward women's health and rights. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries have seen decreased access to and increased violations of SRHR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries with severe restrictions on abortion seem less likely to have implemented changes to SRHR delivery to mitigate this impact. Political will to support the advancement of SRHR is often lacking, which is fundamental to ensuring both continued access and, in a minority of cases, the solidification of gains made to SRHR during the pandemic.","output":"How the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is impacting sexual and reproductive health and rights and response: Results from a global survey of providers, researchers, and policy-makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information release is a key to the macro-economy during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Diosease-2019 (COVID-19).

Many approaches, such as text mining, are employed to explore the information at different stages during the pandemic. According to the results, the government attached great importance to the information related to the pandemic. The main topics of information released by the government included the latest situation of the pandemic, announcements by the State Council, and prevention policies for COVID-19. Information mismatch between the public and Chinese governments contributed to the economic depression caused by the pandemic. Specifically, the topics of the latest situation and popular scientific knowledge regarding the pandemic have gained the most attention of the public. The information demand of the public has changed from the pandemic itself to the recovery of social life and industrial activities after the authority announced the control of the pandemic. However, during the recession phase, the information demand has shifted to asymptomatic infections and global pandemic trends. By contrast, some of the main topics provided by the government, such as How beautiful you are, were excessive because the public demand is insufficient.

Cyclophilins, a family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), play a pivotal role in the life cycles of many viruses and therefore represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral development. We report here the pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of a small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor (SMCypI). Mechanistic and modeling studies revealed that the SMCypI bound to cyclophilin A in competition with cyclosporine (CsA), inhibited its PPIase activity, and disrupted the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction. Resistance selection showed that the lead SMCypI hardly selected amino acid substitutions conferring low-level or no resistance in vitro. Interestingly, the SMCypI selected D320E and Y321H substitutions, located in domain II of the NS5A protein. These substitutions were previously associated with low-level resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir. Finally, the SMCypI inhibited the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family with higher 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) than for HCV. Thus, because of its chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with the potential for broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in viral life cycles.","output":"Characterization of the Anti-Hepatitis C Virus Activity of New Nonpeptidic Small-Molecule Cyclophilin Inhibitors with the Potential for Broad Anti-Flaviviridae Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of January 2021, Indonesia had the 21st highest number of total COVID-19 cases and the 17th highest total deaths among all countries.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with COPD with a vertical P-wave axis as they have not yet been elucidated. METHODS Keio University and its affiliated hospitals conducted an observational COPD cohort study over 3 years. We analyzed 201 patients using ECG and chest computed tomography. RESULTS The severity of airflow limitation was higher in patients with a P-wave axis >75 than in those with a P-wave axis 75. Patients with a P-wave axis >75 exhibited significantly higher total COPD assessment test scores and increased St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total, activity, and impact scores than those with a P-wave axis 75. The incidence of exacerbations over 1 and 3 years was significantly higher in patients with a P-wave axis >75 than in those with a P-wave axis 75. The optimal cutoff for the P-wave axis for a percentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s <50% and future exacerbations over 3 years was 70 (the areas under the curve [AUC]: 0.788; sensitivity: 65.3%; specificity: 78.3%) and 79 (AUC: 0.642; sensitivity: 36.7%; specificity: 92.6%). The ratio of the low attenuation area was also significantly higher in patients with a P-wave axis >75 than in those with a P-wave axis 75. However, the ratio of the airway wall area did not differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COPD with a vertical P-wave axis exhibited severe airflow limitation and emphysema, a worse health status, and more frequent exacerbation than patients without a vertical P-wave.

Under ERAS recommendations, multimodal prophylaxis has been used to help manage postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) following TKR. Dexamethasone is one of the commonly used for this and the anti-inflammatory properties could depress vagal activity, reducing postural hypotension (PH). The hypothesis of this study is that postoperative dexamethasone use is associated with lower rates of early postoperative PH following TKR surgery. In our institution, patients who undergo elective primary TKR are admitted on the day of surgery and follow a standardized ERAS protocol. Data on patients who underwent elective primary TKR under a single adult reconstruction team from September 2017 to March 2020 were reviewed and analyzed. A review of demographic characteristics, surgical data, postoperative medications, and postoperative notes was performed. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the effect of the use of dexamethasone on PH, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) calculated after accounting for potential confounders. Of the 149 patients were included in the study, 78 had dexamethasone postoperatively, and 71 did not. Patients who had received dexamethasone were statistically less likely to suffer from PH (OR = 0.31, p = 0.03) and less likely to develop PONV (OR = 0.21, p = 0.006). Patients who had received dexamethasone were more likely able to participate in early physiotherapy (OR = 2.42, p = 0.14), and this result was statistically insignificant. The use of postoperative intravenous dexamethasone is significantly associated with lower rates of postoperative PH after TKR. However, more studies are required to assess the optimal dosing amount and frequency, as well as to assess other factors which can enhance early postoperative patient mobilization as part of our goals for ERAS.

Among dehydrating fixatives, 80% acetone or a mixture of acetone and ethanol or of acetone, methanol and ethanol were found to be the best fixatives for the detection of these viral determinants which are expressed in infected cells. In the case of acetone, the temperature of fixation and its concentration in the fixative preparation were found to be important. The treatment of 0.05% glutaraldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 0.1% saponin or 0.1% paraformaldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 1%NP-40 led to satisfactory detection of viral determinants. Using Triton X-100 to render cells permeable, the quantities of N and M antigen detected in TGEV-infected cells prefixed with either 0.05% glutaraldehyde or 0.1% paraformaldehyde were equal to those of 80% acetone-fixed, TGEV-infected cells while the quantity of S antigen detected was diminished.

Time-controlled adaptive ventilation was compared with volume-controlled ventilation at the same levels of mean airway pressure and positive end-release pressure (time-controlled adaptive ventilation)/positive end-expiratory pressure (volume-controlled ventilation) in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. DESIGN Animal study. SETTING Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS Twenty-one Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS Twenty-four hours after pneumonia induction, Wistar rats (n = 7) were ventilated with time-controlled adaptive ventilation (tidal volume = 8 mL/kg, airway pressure release ventilation for a Thigh = 0.75-0.85 s, release pressure (Plow) set at 0 cm H2O, and generating a positive end-release pressure = 1.6 cm H2O applied for Tlow = 0.11-0.14 s). The expiratory flow was terminated at 75% of the expiratory flow peak. An additional 14 animals were ventilated using volume-controlled ventilation, maintaining similar time-controlled adaptive ventilation levels of positive end-release pressure (positive end-expiratory pressure=1.6 cm H2O) and mean airway pressure = 10 cm H2O. Additional nonventilated animals (n = 7) were used for analysis of molecular biology markers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS After 1 hour of mechanical ventilation, the heterogeneity score, the expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 in lung tissue were significantly lower in the time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure groups (p = 0.008, p = 0.011, and p = 0.011, respectively). Epithelial cell integrity, measured by E-cadherin tissue expression, was higher in time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure (p = 0.004). Time-controlled adaptive ventilation animals had bacteremia counts lower than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure animals, while time-controlled adaptive ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation with similar positive end-release pressure animals had similar colony-forming unit counts. In addition, lung edema and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 gene expression were more reduced in time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar positive end-release pressure groups. CONCLUSIONS In the model of pneumonia used herein, at the same tidal volume and mean airway pressure, time-controlled adaptive ventilation, compared with volume-controlled ventilation, was associated with less lung damage and bacteremia and reduced gene expression of mediators associated with inflammation.","output":"Time-Controlled Adaptive Ventilation Versus Volume-Controlled Ventilation in Experimental Pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When thrombus fractures and breaks off it can occlude vital vessels such as those of the heart, lung, or brain. These thromboembolic conditions are responsible for 1 in 4 deaths world-wide. This problem is also of significant current interest as 1 in 3 COVID-19 intensive care patients exhibit thromboembolic complications. Thrombus resistance to fracture is driven by its intrinsic fracture toughness as well as other, non-surface-creating dissipative mechanisms. In our current work, we identify and quantify these latter mechanisms toward future studies that aim to delineate fracture from other forms of dissipation. To this end, we use an in vitro thrombus mimic system to produce whole blood clots and explore their dissipative mechanics under simple uniaxial extension, cyclic loading, and stress-relaxation. We found that whole blood clots exhibit Mullins effect, hysteresis, permanent set, strain-rate dependence, and nonlinear stress-relaxation. Interestingly, we found that performing these tests under dry or submerged conditions did not change our results. However, performing these tests under room temperature or body temperature conditions yielded differences.

These 4 hospitals have a combined catchment area of 1,150,000 people or roughly one-fifth of the population of Finland. Results  The incidence rate of severe injuries during the lockdown period was 4.9/10(5) inhabitants (95% CI 3.7C6.4). The incidence rate of severe injuries during years 2016C2018 was 5.1/10(5) inhabitants (CI 3.9C6.5). We could not detect a significant incidence difference between the lockdown period and the 3 previous years (incidence rate difference C0.2 (CI C2.0 to 1.7). The proportion of traffic-related accidents was 55% during the lockdown period and 51% during previous years. There were no detectable differences in injury patterns. During the lockdown period, the mean age of patients was higher (53 years vs. 47 years, p = 0.03) and the rate of severely injured elderly patients (aged 70 or more) was higher (30% vs. 16%). Interpretation  Despite heavy social restrictions, the incidence of severe injuries during the lockdown period was similar to previous years. Notably, a decline in road use and traffic volumes did not reduce the number of severe traffic accidents. Although our data is compatible with a decrease of 2.0 to an increase of 1.7 severely injured patients per 10(5) inhabitants, we conclude that severely injured patients do not disappear even during pandemic and stabile hospital resources are needed to treat these patients.","output":"Severely injured patients do not disappear in a pandemic: Incidence and characteristics of severe injuries during COVID-19 lockdown in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Registry data show that Cushing's syndrome (CS) and adrenal insufficiency (AI) increase mortality rates associated with infectious diseases. Little information is available on susceptibility to infections, especially milder forms that do not require hospitalization or prescription drugs. This study aimed to investigate infectious diseases in patients with glucocorticoid disorders through the development of a specific tool. Methods: We developed and administered the ICARO questionnaire addressing infectious events over a 12-month observation period to 1017 outpatients referred to four University Hospitals between 2018 and 2019. The ICARO questionnaire showed good test-retest reliability. The odds of infection were estimated after adjustment for potential confounders and collated into the ICARO score, reflecting the frequency and duration of infections. Results: 75 patients were diagnosed with hypercortisolism and 135 with hypocortisolism; 237 were excluded for uncontrolled disease. The remaining 570 served as controls. Compared to controls, hypercortisolism was associated with higher odds of respiratory (2.3) and urinary tract infections (4.1), mycoses (3.3) and flu (2.1). Subgroup analysis confirmed an increased risk of UTI (3.7) and flu (3.2) in mild hypercortisolism. Post-dexamethasone cortisol levels correlated with the ICARO score. Hypocortisolism also exhibited higher odds of mycoses (2.3), gastrointestinal (2.2) and urinary tract infections (2.5), independently of any glucocorticoid replacement dose. Conclusions.

We performed a pooled analysis of published data intending to summarize clinical presentation and patient outcomes in those with established rheumatic disease diagnosis and concurrent COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies reporting data about rheumatic disease patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and published until July 22, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled incidence and rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality among these patients, and interstudy heterogeneity was identified using I2 statistics with greater than 75% value indicating substantial interstudy variation. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included, giving a total sample size of 49,099 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 49,099 COVID-19 patients, a total of 1382 were also diagnosed with a rheumatic disease in the past.

Non-Hispanic Black women have higher incidence of preterm birth compared to other racial/ethnic groups and may be disproportionately exposed to EDCs through EDC-containing hair products. However, research on the use of EDC-associated hair products during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth is lacking. Therefore, the objective of this pilot study was to estimate associations of prenatal hair product use with gestational age at delivery in a Boston, Massachusetts area pregnancy cohort. METHODS: The study population consisted of a subset of participants enrolled in the Environmental Reproductive and Glucose Outcomes (ERGO) Study between 2018 and 2020. We collected self-reported data on demographics and hair product use using a previously validated questionnaire at four prenatal visits (median: 12, 19, 26, 36 weeks gestation) and abstracted gestational age at delivery from medical records. We compared gestational age and hair product use by race/ethnicity and used linear regression to estimate covariate-adjusted associations of product use and frequency of use at each study visit with gestational age at delivery. Primary models were adjusted for maternal age at enrollment and delivery method. RESULTS: Of the 154 study participants, 7% delivered preterm. Non-Hispanic Black participants had lower mean gestational age at delivery compared to non-Hispanic White participants (38.2 vs. 39.2 weeks) and were more likely to report ever and more frequent use of hair products. In regression models, participants reporting daily use of hair oils at visit 4 had lower mean gestational age at delivery compared to non-users (: -8.3 days; 95% confidence interval: -14.9, -1.6). We did not find evidence of associations at earlier visits or with other products. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent use of hair oils during late pregnancy may be associated with shorter gestational duration.

Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed and purchased drugs that has been widely detected in wastewater and surface water. The present study investigated paracetamol degradation by photocatalytic treatment in a batch system using TiO2 supported on aluminosilicate recovered from waste LED panel (ATiO2). The prepared ATiO2 catalyst was characterized for morphology, elemental composition and crystallinity using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. ATiO2 was spherical in morphology with a predominance of the anatase phase of TiO2 and an average size of a15 nm. Subsequently, the effects of operating parameters, viz., initial paracetamol concentration (1-10 mg/L), catalyst dosage (0.5-4.0 g/L) and pH (4-10) on paracetamol degradation were investigated using central composite design (CCD). A polynomial model was developed to interpret the linear and interactive effect of operating parameters on the paracetamol degradation efficiency. About 99% degradation efficiency of paracetamol was obtained at optimum conditions (Initial paracetamol concentration a2.74 mg/L, ATiO2 dosage a2.71 g/L and pH a 9.5). The mechanism of paracetamol degradation was adsorption on aluminosilicate and subsequent degradation by TiO2. ATiO2 could be effectively reused up to 3 cycles, with <5% decrease in the degradation efficiency.","output":"Photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol using aluminosilicate supported TiO2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive global health crisis with damaging consequences to mental health and social relationships. Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. Whilst compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety and stress, and social safeness. METHODS: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide, and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress and social safeness. RESULTS: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries. CONCLUSIONS: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion focused interventions and communications could be implemented to reduce resistances to compassion and promote mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic.","output":"Fears of compassion magnify the harmful effects of threat of COVID-19 on mental health and social safeness across 21 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worsening of clinical symptoms after COVID\\\\19 infection and misregulation of CD4 and CD8 T\\\\cell numbers may be revealed in PD patients.

Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size &#8805;30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25-51), 38% (95% CI = 24-52), and 48% (95% CI = 11-85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance.

The mortality occurs mainly in children less than 5 years of age. No licensed vaccine is available, and conventional efforts for developing an effective and safe vaccine against shigellosis have not been succeeded yet. The reverse vaccinology is a novel promising method that screens genome or proteome of an organism for finding new vaccine candidates. In this study, through reverse vaccinology approach, new vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri were identified and experimentally evaluated. Proteomes of S. flexneri were obtained from UniProt, and then outer membrane and extracellular proteins were predicted and selected for the evaluation of transmembrane domains, protein conservation, host homology, antigenicity, and solubility. From 103 proteins, 7 high-scored proteins were introduced as novel vaccine candidates, and after B- and T-cell epitope prediction, the best protein was selected for experimental studies. Recombinant protein was expressed, purified, and injected to BALB/c mice. The adhesion inhibitory effect of sera was also studied. The immunized mice demonstrated full protection against the lethal dose challenge. The sera remarkably inhibited S. flexneri adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells. The results indicate that identified antigen can serve for vaccine development against shigellosis and support reverse vaccinology for discovering novel effective antigens. KEY POINTS: ? Seven Shigella new antigens were identified by reverse vaccinology (RV) approach. ? The best antigen experimented demonstrated full protection against lethal dose. ?

This systematic review aims to synthesise current evidence regarding: (1) FCR-related healthcare usage and costs and (2) the cost-effectiveness of FCR treatments. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane and other electronic databases using MeSH headings and keywords for cancer, FCR and costs from their inception to September 2019. Identified studies were screened for eligibility. Original, peer-reviewed journal articles reporting quantitative data from samples of adults treated for cancer written in English were included. Quality was appraised using the Drummond checklist for economic evaluations or the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. RESULTS Data from 11 studies were extracted and synthesised. Seven studies addressed the costs of FCR and suggested an increase in the use of primary and secondary healthcare. Four studies addressed the cost-effectiveness of different FCR treatments and suggest that some treatments may cost-effectively reduce FCR and improve quality of life. Reviewed treatments had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between AU$3,233 and AU$152,050 per quality-adjusted life year gained when adjusted to 2019 Australian dollars. All studies were of sufficient quality to be synthesised in this review. CONCLUSIONS FCR appears to be associated with greater use of certain healthcare resources, and FCR may be treated cost-effectively. Thus, appropriate FCR treatments may not only reduce the individual burden, but also the strain on the healthcare system. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm this and ensure the future implementation of efficient and sustainable FCR treatments.","output":"A systematic review of fear of cancer recurrence related healthcare use and intervention cost-effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Hypofractionated radiotherapy (HF-RT) has been used in the UK as a non-surgical treatment for locally advanced laryngeal cancer (LALC) in the past. HF-RT has been readopted in some departments during the COVID-19 pandemic due to having a shorter overall treatment time and fewer attendances. This study explores the outcomes of a cohort of patients treated from 2003 to 2012 at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (Scotland, UK). Materials and Methods: 36 patients received HF-RT (55 Gy in 20 fractions) through 2D or 3D conformal radiotherapy, 7 of them received concurrent cisplatin (CRT). Overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence free survival (LRFS), progression free survival (PFS), laryngectomy free survival (LFS), disease specific survival (DSS) and late toxicity data were analysed in patients treated with HF-RT at 1-year (1Y), 2-year (2Y) and 5-year (5Y). The same outcomes were measured between the RT and CRT group for any differences. Results: The mean follow-up durationwas 43.0 months. OS at 1Y, 2Y and 5Y was 69.4%, 52.8% and 30.6%. LRFS at 1Y, 2Y and 5Y was 63.9%, 47.2% and 25.0%. PFS at 1Y, 2Y and 5Y was 63.9%, 44.4% and 25.0%. LFS at 1Y, 2Y and 5Y was 69.4%, 50.0% and 27.8%. DSS at 1Y, 2Y and 5Y was 63.9%, 52.8% and 30.6%. During the period of treatment and up to 5Y follow up, 41.7% of patients required an NG tube for feeding and 25% required a PEG tube at any point. 22.2% of patients required long term enteral feeding via PEG tube beyond 5Y. No significant differences were found in the survival outcomes or alternative feeding route outcomes between patients treated by RT alone or CRT.

Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are highly effective, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility2. The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially for aged populations. Here we describe the isolation of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a new therapeutic drug in infected aged animals. Many of the alterations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (positions 417, 484, 493, 498 and 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern2. Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for selection. For murine SARS, for which severity is also age dependent, elevated levels of an eicosanoid (prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)) and a phospholipase (phospholipase A2 group 2D (PLA2G2D)) contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice3,4. mRNA expression of PLA2G2D and prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR), and production of PGD2 also increase with ageing and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in dendritic cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Using our mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that middle-aged mice lacking expression of PTGDR or PLA2G2D are protected from severe disease. Furthermore, treatment with a PTGDR antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from lethal infection. PTGDR antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, suggesting that the PLA2G2D-PGD2/PTGDR pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions.","output":"Eicosanoid signalling blockade protects middle-aged mice from severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Feline coronavirus (FCoV) can lead to Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which the precise cause is still unknown.

Insufficiency of prior therapeutic approaches suggest need to identify dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) and induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown and clearance.

The Quantile regression technique is employed to test for the relationship between private and public health care expenses and its determinants. The Pooled mean group causality test is used to examine the causal connections among the variables. RESULTS: The outcome of the quantile regression test revealed that economic growth and aging population could induce healthcare costs in emerging countries. However, the impact of industrialization, agricultural activities, and technological advancement on health expenses are found to be noticeably heterogeneous at the various quantile levels. Unidirectional causality was found between industrialization and public health expenses; whereas two-way causal influence was reveled amongst public health expenditure and GDP per capita; public health expenditure and agricultural activities.

In a general model, adversity was associated with altered amygdala rs-fc with clusters within the left anterior lateral prefrontal cortex. In a dimensional model, abuse was associated with altered amygdala rs-fc within the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsal precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior mid-cingulate cortex, as well as within the dorsal attention, visual, and somatomotor networks. Neglect was associated with altered amygdala rs-fc with the hippocampus, supplementary motor cortex, temporoparietal junction, and regions within the dorsal attention network.

Therefore, H2A.X has been considered a suitable marker for biomedical applications and a general indicator of direct DNA damage with other therapeutic agents, such as cold physical plasma. Medical plasma technology generates a partially ionized gas releasing a plethora of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS) simultaneously that have been used for therapeutic purposes such as wound healing and cancer treatment.

However, phosphorylated H2A.X occurs during apoptosis, which is associated with exposure to cold plasma and ROS. This review summarizes the current understanding of H2A.X induction and function in oxidative stress in general and plasma medicine in particular.

This study investigated whether sociodemographic variables, changes in physical activity, and sleep quality from pre- to during lockdown were predictors of change in mental wellbeing in quarantined older adults. METHODS: A 12-week international online survey was launched in 14 languages on 6 April 2020. Forty-one research institutions from Europe, Western-Asia, North-Africa, and the Americas, promoted the survey. The survey was presented in a differential format with questions related to responses \\"pre\\" and \\"during\\" the lockdown period. Participants responded to the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Replies from older adults (aged &gt;55 years, n = 517), mainly from Europe (50.1%), Western-Asia (6.8%), America (30%), and North-Africa (9.3%) were analyzed. The COVID-19 lockdown led to significantly decreased mental wellbeing, sleep quality, and total physical activity energy expenditure levels (all p &lt; 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the change in total PSQI score and total physical activity energy expenditure (F&lt;sub&gt;(2, 514)&lt;/sub&gt; = 66.41 p &lt; 0.001) were significant predictors of the decrease in mental wellbeing from pre- to during lockdown (p &lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.20).

Personal discomfort has been associated with use of PPE, and anecdotal reports describe pressure injuries related to wearing PPE. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the occurrence of device-related pressure injuries due to wearing PPE among Italian nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in critical care settings. METHODS: This descriptive study used an online survey investigating both the demographic characteristics of respondents and complications related to wearing PPE, including the development of pressure injuries. RESULTS: A total of 266 nurses throughout Italy completed the survey; 32% of respondents were men. Nurses' median age was 36 years (range 22-59 years), and the median time spent working in their current clinical setting (an intensive care or high-dependency unit) was 3 years (range 0-32 years). Personal protective equipment was worn for a median duration of 5 hours (range 2-12 hours). While wearing PPE, 92.8% of nurses experienced pain and 77.1% developed device-related pressure injuries, mainly on the nose, ears, and forehead. Pain was more frequent among nurses with such injuries. Transparent dressings, emollient cream, and no dressing were associated with development of device-related pressure injury. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure injuries related to PPE represent an important adverse effect for nurses caring for patients with COVID-19.

This study aimed to develop a TUS protocol to effectively induce brain plasticity in human subjects. METHODS An 80 s train of theta burst patterned TUS (tbTUS), regularly patterned TUS (rTUS) with the same sonication duration and sham tbTUS were delievered to the motor cortex in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to examine changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and the site of plasticity induction. The effects of motor cortical tbTUS on a visuo-motor task and the effects of occipital cortex tbTUS on motor cortical excitability were also tested. RESULTS The tbTUS produced consistent increase in corticospinal excitability for at least 30 minutes while rTUS and sham tbTUS produced no significant change. tbTUS decreased short-interval intracortical inhibiton and increased intracortical facilitation. The effects of TMS in different current directions suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. tbTUS to the occipital cortex did not change motor cortical excitability. Motor cortical tbTUS shortened movement time in a visuo-motor task. INTERPRETATION tbTUS is a novel and efficient paradigm to induce cortical plasticity in human.

The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a second-generation antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and Ad-ACE2-transduced mice. Tmprss2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells, however, such antiviral efficacy was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. Accordingly, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 regulatory locus in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19 through reducing TMPRSS2 expression in lung cells.","output":"Distinct mechanisms for TMPRSS2 expression explain organ-specific inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzalutamide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present work was to evaluate the possible risk of toxic effects due to the ingestion of a honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) accidentally present in food.

The amount of venom present in a bee is considered insufficient to induce detectable toxic effects in a person who ingests it by accident, and various components of the venom are destroyed by gastric secretions. However, despite the rare frequency, there is a risk of the ingestion of a bee, causing an allergic reaction to some components of the venom in sensitized individuals.

Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). Twenty-two metabolites were identified; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of in vitro maturation media. Hence, our data suggest that the currently used media for equine oocyte maturation can be further improved. ABSTRACT: Production of equine embryos in vitro is currently a commercial technique and a reliable way of obtaining offspring. In order to produce those embryos, immature oocytes are retrieved from postmortem ovaries or live mares by ovum pick-up (OPU), matured in vitro (IVM), fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and cultured until day 8C10 of development. However, at best, roughly 10% of the oocytes matured in vitro and followed by ICSI end up in successful pregnancy and foaling, and this could be due to suboptimal IVM conditions. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid (FF) obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). The results were contrasted against the composition of the most commonly used media for equine oocyte IVM: tissue culture medium 199 (TCM-199) and Dulbeccos modified eagle medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12). Twenty-two metabolites were identified in equine FF; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of DMEM/F-12 or TCM-199 media, including (mean  SEM): acetylcarnitine (0.37  0.2 mM), carnitine (0.09  0.01 mM), citrate (0.4  0.04 mM), creatine (0.36  0.14 mM), creatine phosphate (0.36  0.05 mM), fumarate (0.05  0.007 mM), glucose-1-phosphate (6.9  0.4 mM), histamine (0.25  0.01 mM), or lactate (27.3  2.2 mM). Besides, the mean concentration of core metabolites such as glucose varied (4.3 mM in FF vs. 5.55 mM in TCM-199 vs. 17.5 mM in DMEM/F-12).

A multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A structured interviewer-based administered questionnaire and observational checklist were used to collect the data. The collected data were entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with insecticide-treated nets utilization. Adjusted odds ratios along 95% CI were estimated to measure the strength of the association and declared statistical significance at a p-value < 0.05. Results: Of a total respondents, 39.9% (95% CI: 34.9-44.2%) utilize insecticide-treated nets. Pregnant women from rural (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.38), employed women (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.86), monthly income >1050 Ethiopian total birr (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.84), third trimester pregnancy (AOR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09, 4.40), and having antenatal care for current pregnancy (AOR = 3.86, 95% CI: 1.63, 9.10) were factors significantly associated with insecticide-treated nets. Conclusion: The utilization of insecticide-treated nets is relatively low.

This study explores how immune boosting is portrayed on the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Content analysis. METHODS: We compiled a dataset of 227 webpages from Google searches in Canada and the USA using the phrase boost immunity AND coronavirus on 1 April 2020. We coded webpages for typology and portrayal of immune boosting and supplements. We recorded mentions of microbiome, whether the webpage was selling or advertising an immune boosting product or service, and suggested strategies for boosting immunity. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between webpages that appeared in the searches in Canada and the USA. The most common types of webpages were from news (40.5%) and commercial (24.7%) websites. The concept of immune boosting was portrayed as beneficial for avoiding COVID-19 in 85.5% of webpages and supplements were portrayed as beneficial in 40% of the webpages, but commercial sites were more likely to have these portrayals. The top immune boosting strategies were vitamin C (34.8%), diet (34.4%), sleep (34.4%), exercise (30.8%) and zinc (26.9%). Less than 10% of the webpages provide any critique of the concept of immune boosting. CONCLUSIONS: Pairing evidence-based advice for maintaining ones health (eg, healthy diet, exercise, sleep) with the phrase immune boosting and strategies lacking in evidence may inadvertently help to legitimise the concept, making it a powerful marketing tool.

If policymakers consequently relax climate policy measures to maintain the 2030 target, the opportunity will be missed to align EU climate policy with longer-term Paris emissions mitigation goals. Our analysis highlights that although existing climate policy measures will likely reduce emissions more than 40% by 2030 in the wake of the pandemic, they will not be enough to meet the Paris agreement.

Learning in this area could be delivered using practical laboratory exercises, or potentially, simulation-based education. Simulation has previously successfully enhanced learning in health professional education. The current global climate due to COVID-19 has further highlighted the important role of technology-enhanced learning in delivering outcomes that meet the requisite learning objectives of a course. The aim of the present study was to compare the impact of a commercially available virtual microbiology simulation (VUMIE?) with a traditional wet laboratory (wetlab) on learner knowledge, skills and confidence in a second-year integrated pharmacotherapeutics course for Bachelor of Pharmacy students. METHODS: A randomised, crossover study was employed to determine whether the simulation intervention (VUMIE?) improves learning outcomes (knowledge, skills and confidence) of pharmacy students, when compared to a traditional wetlab intervention. Each student completed three 1C2 h length sessions, for both the wetlab and VUMIE? interventions (6 sessions total). Data was collected using surveys deployed at baseline (pre-interventions), post-intervention 1 or 2 (VUMIE? or wetlab) and endpoint (post-interventions 1 and 2). Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics 25 and Instat? software. RESULTS: Response rates were approximately 50% at initial survey and approximately 25% at endpoint survey. VUMIE? produced higher post-intervention knowledge scores for the multiple-choice questions compared to the wetlab, however, the highest score was achieved at endpoint. Both interventions produced statistically significant differences for mean scores compared to baseline (pre-VUMIE? and wetlab) across the domains of knowledge, skills and confidence. VUMIE? produced higher post-intervention mean scores for knowledge, skills and confidence compared to post-intervention mean scores for the wetlab, however there was no statistical significance between the mean score for the two interventions, thus the VUMIE? activity produced learning outcomes comparable to the wetlab activity. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest VUMIE? provides similar effects on students knowledge, skills, and confidence as a wetlab. The simulations implementation was not cost-prohibitive, provided students with a physically and psychologically safe learning environment, and the benefit of being able to repeat activities, supporting deliberate practice.","output":"Can a virtual microbiology simulation be as effective as the traditional Wetlab for pharmacy student education?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2C7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12C20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8C11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10C12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.

Residents received coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine at vaccination station are obliged to stay in the vaccination station at least 30 minutes. The period of post-vaccination observation is an ideal time for hand washing intervention. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a health intervention on hand washing among residents, who received the COVID-19 vaccine, by using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Methods: This randomized controlled trial was carried out between March 2021 and May 2021 in Wuhan, China. Participants were recruited using randomized cluster sampling and divided into intervention group and control group by random allocation. Data were collected using a self-administered researcher-made questionnaire based on TPB and Hand washing Questionnaire. Validity (content validity index = 0.87;content validity ratio = 0.89) and reliability of the questionnaires were confirmed ( = 0.96). Intervention was implemented during the observation period post-vaccinated (lasting 15 min) using videos and live training based on TPB constructs. Results: A total of 448 residents were participated with a response rate of 71.9% (322). The mean age of the participants was 46 (53% females). Compared with the control group, the scores of subjective norm ( P = 0.009) and perceived behavioral control ( P < 0.001) in intervention group were higher after one time intervention. Mean scores of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavior control and intention of intervention group was significantly higher than the control group after twice intervention ( P < 0.001). Moreover, participants in the intervention group performed better than those in the control group on daily hand-washing times ( P = 0.044), hand sanitizer use ( P = 0.003), rub time ( P < 0.001), following the six-step technique ( P < 0.001) after intervention.

The primary modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appear to be direct mucus membrane contact with infectious droplets and through exposure to formites. Knowledge of the survival characteristics of the virus is essential for formulating appropriate infection-control measures. Methods. Survival of SARS-CoV strain GVU6109 was studied in stool and respiratory specimens. Survival of the virus on different environmental surfaces, including a laboratory request form, an impervious disposable gown, and a cotton nondisposable gown, was investigated. The virucidal effects of sodium hypochlorite, house detergent, and a peroxygen compound (Virkon S; Antec International) on the virus were also studied. Results. SARS-CoV GVU6109 can survive for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples with an alkaline pH, and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for >7 days at room temperature. Even at a relatively high concentration (10(4) tissue culture infective doses/mL), the virus could not be recovered after drying of a paper request form, and its infectivity was shown to last longer on the disposable gown than on the cotton gown. All disinfectants tested were shown to be able to reduce the virus load by >3 log within 5 min. Conclusions. Fecal and respiratory samples can remain infectious for a long period of time at room temperature. The risk of infection via contact with droplet-contaminated paper is small. Absorbent material, such as cotton, is preferred to nonabsorptive material for personal protective clothing for routine patient care where risk of large spillage is unlikely.

In recent years, some international studies have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches combined with geographic information systems (GIS-MCDA) to support decision-makers in assessing the suitability of agricultural land for irrigation in semi-arid regions. Unlike previous studies, which have only considered a single source of water for crop irrigation, this study proposes a GIS-MCDA approach that considers all potentially available local water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface water, and wastewater) as possible alternatives for better multisource water resource management (MWRM) in regions facing water shortages. The geospatial multicriteria evaluation implemented in this study considers a series of technical, environmental, and agricultural productivity criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three independent baseline maps were generated, showing the spatial distribution of suitable areas for crop irrigation for each considered water source in the studied area. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater offered suitable crop irrigation for 83%, 70%, and 26% of the study area, respectively. Overlapping these areas produced a final map showing all the feasible areas for each crop irrigation alternative at the same time. The MWRM approach considering all water sources increased the coverage of suitable areas to be irrigated in the study area by 2.2%, 20.4%, and more than 225% compared to considering surface water, groundwater, and wastewater, respectively, independently.

We studied three independent domiciliary dentistry clinics in the province of Quebec, Canada. We completed observations of 27 domiciliary visits, four of which were in private homes and the remaining 23 in LTCFs. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with dental professionals, patients, and caregivers. We performed a qualitative content analysis using a deductive/inductive coding framework. RESULTS: We presented a detailed description of the physical and service features of the studied cases. Physical features included the set-up of the mobile clinics, the portable equipment used, and the domiciliary locations of visits. For service features, we described the roles, attitudes, and interactions among those involved on both the providers and recipients sides, as well as, the logistical and financial aspect of the domiciliary dental services.

Typical symptoms include temperature, muscle weakness, and loss of appetite. Whereas we experience these changes as a pathology, in fact they are a carefully orchestrated response mediated by the immune system. Its purpose is to optimize immune cell functionality against pathogens whilst minimizing viral replication in infected cells. Sickness behavior is controlled at several levels, most notably by the central nervous system, but also by other organs that mediate systemic homeostasis, such as the liver and adipose tissue. Nevertheless, the changes mediated by these organs are ultimately initiated by immune cells, usually through local or systemic secretion of cytokines. The nature of infection determines which cytokine profile is induced by immune cells and therefore which sickness behavior ensues. In context of infection, sickness behavior is typically beneficial. However, inappropriate activation of the immune system may induce adverse aspects of sickness behavior. For example, tissue stress caused by obesity may result in chronic activation of the immune system, leading to lasting changes in systemic metabolism. Concurrently, metabolic disease prevents induction of appropriate sickness behavior following viral infection, thus impairing the normal immune response. In this article, we will revisit recent literature that elucidates both the benefits and the negative aspects of sickness behavior in context of viral infection.","output":"Immunological Mechanisms of Sickness Behavior in Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement.

Opioids are associated with adverse effects in this population, so oral acetaminophen is commonly prescribed to minimize opioid use. Intravenous (iv) acetaminophen has been reported to have superior efficacy and bioavailability than oral acetaminophen. Nevertheless, its effect on postoperative outcomes in emergency hip fractures is unclear. This systematic review assessed the effect of iv acetaminophen on postoperative outcomes in older hip fracture patients. SOURCE We searched multiple databases from inception to June 2021 for studies on adults > 50 yr of age undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery who received iv acetaminophen (or paracetamol) and that reported postoperative outcomes. Relevant titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened based on the eligibility criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the selected papers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Of 3,510 initial studies, four met the inclusion criteria. One was a prospective cohort study and three were retrospective cohort studies. All four studies used historical control groups. Three studies reported a significantly lower mean opioid dose with iv acetaminophen than with oral acetaminophen. Three studies also reported a significantly shorter hospital stay. One study each reported a significant decrease in the number of missed physical therapy sessions, the need for one-to-one supervision, and episodes of delirium. CONCLUSION There is very limited low-level evidence that iv acetaminophen improves preoperative and postoperative analgesia and shortens hospital stay in older hip fracture patients. Nevertheless, our results should be interpreted with caution since there are no prospective randomized trials investigating whether iv acetaminophen improves postoperative outcomes in this patient population.

The urgency stems from the frequent tendency to focus attention on seemingly high promising digital health interventions despite being poorly validated in times of crisis. AIM: In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this crisis. METHODS: Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of 26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this manuscript. RESULTS: Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and research during COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the local, national, and international levels.

DESIGN: Rapid review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase and Google, as well as the websites of relevant national health departments, were searched from 1 January 2020 to 24 April 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Documents included must be issued by a national health authority, must be specific to COVID-19 care, directed at healthcare workers or managers, and must refer to the role of primary care in the COVID-19 response. RESULTS: We identified 17 documents from 14 countries. An adapted framework on primary care challenges and responses to pandemic influenza framed our analysis. Guidelines generally reported on COVID-19 service delivery and mostly made specific recommendations for ensuring continued delivery of essential primary care services through telehealth or other virtual care modalities. Few offered guidance to support surveillance as a public health function. All offered guidance on implementing outbreak control measures, largely through flexible and coordinated organisational models with partners from various sectors. There was a lack of guidance to support supply chain management and practice resilience in primary care, and lack of personal protective equipment represents a serious threat to the provision of quality care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Current national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 provide guidance on infection control and minimising the risk of spread in primary care practices, while supporting the use of new technology and coordinated partnerships. However, to ensure primary care practice resilience and quality of care are upheld, guidelines must offer recommendations on supply chain management and operational continuity, supported by adequate resources.","output":"National primary care responses to COVID-19: a rapid review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this work was to synthesize composites of polyurethane (PU) with organoclays (OC) exhibiting antimicrobial properties. Layered silicate (saponite) was modified with octadecyltrimethylammonium cations (ODTMA) and functionalized with phloxine B (PhB) and used as a filler in the composites. A unique property of composite materials is the increased concentration of modifier particles on the surface of the composite membranes. Materials of different compositions were tested and investigated using physico-chemical methods, such as infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, contact angle measurements, absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopy in the visible region. The composition of an optimal material was as follows: n(ODTMA)/m(Sap) = 0.8 mmol g(?1) and n(PhB)/m(Sap) = 0.1 mmol g(?1). Only about 1.5% of present PhB was released in a cultivation medium for bacteria within 24 h, which proved good stability of the composite. Anti-biofilm properties of the composite membranes were proven in experiments with resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The composites without PhB reduced the biofilm growth 100-fold compared to the control sample (non-modified PU). The composite containing PhB in combination with the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) reduced cell growth by about 10,000-fold, thus proving the significant photosensitizing effect of the membranes. Cell damage was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A new method of the synthesis of composite materials presented in this work opens up new possibilities for targeted modification of polymers by focusing on their surfaces. Such composite materials retain the properties of the unmodified polymer inside the matrix and only the surface of the material is changed. Although these unique materials presented in this work are based on PU, the method of surface modification can also be applied to other polymers. Such modified polymers could be useful for various applications in which special surface properties are required, for example, for materials used in medical practice.","output":"Surface Characterization and Anti-Biofilm Effectiveness of Hybrid Films of Polyurethane Functionalized with Saponite and Phloxine B"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer therapy has undergone a drastic revolution in the past few decades with the introduction of several novel therapies, like immunotherapy (active and passive), stem cell-based therapies, and nanocarrier-based therapies.

Further, the introduction of such treatments has improved survival and converted a terminal disease into a more manageable condition. However, many clinical, ethical, and regulatory issues are raised with such novel additions. Several effective therapies are under research but could not come to market or are delayed due to regulatory concerns for marketing approval.

METHODS: The data of all patients who were admitted to outpatient clinics at Hisar Intercontinental Hospital or the hospital's online patient portal system between March 11th and May 30th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Of all patients, 545 in outpatient clinics and 25 in online portal system, (17%) were hospitalized for medical treatment, and 53 underwent surgery. There were 1032 patients admitted to Urology Clinics and 104 patients who underwent surgery in the same period of 2019. The pre-operative assessment of patients who were candidates of urological surgery included certain criteria for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of patients included in this study, the median age was 41 years (18-90). The mean hospital stay was 1 day (1-12), and the mean duration of operation was 25 min (3-250). Thirty-seven patients (69.8%) underwent general anesthesia, while only 11(20.8%) underwent combined spinal epidural anesthesia. Four patients (7.5%) required local and only one patient (1.9%) underwent sedo-analgesia. Complications were encountered in six patients (11.4%), urosepsis in two, pneumonia in one, and urinary tract infection in three patients. Compared to last year's numbers, the number of patients admitted to the hospital's outpatient clinic and that of hospitalized patients decreased by 47.2% and 49.1%, respectively.

Objectives To describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of five Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27th and April 12th, 2020 with troponin-I (normal value <0.03ng/mL) measured within 24 hours of admission were included (n=2,736). Demographics, medical history, admission labs, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals EHR. Results The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization. In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations. After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g. troponin I 0.03-0.09ng/mL, n=455, 16.6%) were significantly associated with death (adjusted HR: 1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.24; P<0.001) while greater amounts (e.g. troponin I>0.09 ng/dL, n=530, 19.4%) were significantly associated with higher risk (adjusted HR 3.03, 95% CI 2.42-3.80; P<0.001). Conclusions Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 however troponin concentrations were generally present at low levels. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD. Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher risk of mortality.","output":"Prevalence and Impact of Myocardial Injury in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor's state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","output":"Public parks and the pandemic: How park usage has been affected by COVID-19 policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sexually dimorphic differentiation of sex-shared behaviors is observed across the animal world, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood.

Electrophysiological recording from the NMJ of C. elegans not only reveals an enhanced neurotransmitter release but also demonstrates increased sensitivity of synaptic exocytosis to extracellular calcium concentration in adult males. Furthermore, the cholinergic synapses in adult males are characterized with weaker synaptic depression but faster vesicle replenishment than that in hermaphrodites. Interestingly, T-type calcium channels/CCA-1 play a male-specific role in acetylcholine release at the NMJs in adult animals. Taken together, our results demonstrate sexually dimorphic differentiation of synaptic mechanisms at the C. elegans NMJs, and thus provide a new mechanistic insight into how biological sex shapes animal behaviors through sex-shared neurons and circuits.","output":"Sexually Dimorphic Neurotransmitter Release at the Neuromuscular Junction in Adult Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recognition of COVID-19 infection from X-ray images is an emerging field in the learning and computer vision community.

Telemedicine enables prompt evaluation of patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury, even at a distance, without prejudice to the prognosis. The present study aimed to verify the validity of range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign tele-assessment in adults with traumatic brachial plexus injury (TBPI). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of twenty-one men and women with TBPI admitted for treatment at a Rehabilitation Hospital Network was conducted. The participants were assessed for range of motion, muscle strength, sensitivity, and Tinel sign at two moments: in-person assessment (IPA) and tele-assessment (TA). RESULTS: The TA muscle strength tests presented significant and excellent correlations with the IPA (the intra-rater intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC ranged between 0.79 and 1.00 depending on the muscle tested). The agreement between the TA and IPA range of motion tests ranged from substantial to moderate (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.47C0.76 (p < 0.05) depending on the joint), and the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement in the range of motion tests of supination, wrist flexors, shoulder flexors, and shoulder external rotators. The agreement between the IPA andTA sensitivity tests of all innervations ranged from substantial to almost perfect (weighted kappa coefficient 0.61C0.83, p < 0.05) except for the C5 innervation, where the kappa coefficient did not indicate a statistically significant agreement. The IPA versus TA Tinel sign test showed a moderate agreement (weighted kappa coefficient of 0.57, p < 0.05).

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were discharge from the hospital or in-hospital death. Examined predictors included patient demographics, chronic diseases, home medications, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital medications and timeframe of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 3219 (90.4%) patients were discharged or died in the hospital. The median age was 65.2 (IQR 52.6-77.2) years, the median length of stay in the hospital was 6.0 (IQR 3.2-10.1) days, and 51% were female. Hypertension was the most common chronic disease, occurring in 2386 (74.1%) patients. Overall mortality rate was 16.0%. Blacks represented 52.3% of patients and had a mortality rate of 13.5%. Mortality was highest at 18.5% in the prepeak hospital COVID-19 volume, decreasing to 15.3% during the peak period and to 10.8% in the postpeak period. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05, p<0.001) for every increase in 1 year of age and being male (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.81, p<0.001). Certain chronic diseases increased the odds of in-hospital mortality, especially chronic kidney disease. Administration of vitamin C, corticosteroids and therapeutic heparin in the hospital was associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality was highest in early admissions and improved as our experience in treating patients with COVID-19 increased.

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18C64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18C64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10 000 or 1 in 100 000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (288%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (712%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 294% (95% CI 286C302) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 274% [268C280]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 613% [605C621]).

In this study, we examine the content of local television news as representations of, and potential influence on, paid leave policy agendas. To do so, we analyze the extent to which local television news coverage describes the problem of lack of employment leave, and whether coverage highlights public policy as a solution. We use data from local television stations affiliated with the four major networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX) in all 210 media markets in the U.S. during a period pre-pandemic, from October 2018 until July 2019. We find that 64% of local television news coverage related to paid leave discussed the issue in the context of public policy.

A workshop on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation in Europe reviewed the 'PrEP gap' and the East/West divide with an additional presentation on upcoming PrEP technologies. The conference featured symposia from WHO: STIs are still increasing and with no Euro universal surveillance systems. Other symposia focused on health inequalities amongst gender and sexual minorities and the recently published changes in IUSTI guidelines on gonorrhoea, syphilis and Lymphogranuloma Venereum. SARS-CoV-2 was a focus for several plenary sessions and its possibly lasting impact on service delivery. New challenges were discussed, particularly the loss of azithromycin as a useful antimicrobial. The symposia covered latest research and work into genomics of STIs. Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionised infectious disease study, particularly infection transmission and control. There was a debate on whether 'screening and treatment of bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infection is associated with Antimicrobial Resistance and should be reconsidered', emphasising limited damage of asymptomatic infection and the possibility of emergence of rapid antibiotic resistance.

Emerging evidence suggests that there might be an association between COVID-19 and GBS. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed bioinformatic analyses to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between COVID-19 and GBS. RESULTS: COVID-19 and GBS were associated with a similar subset of immune/inflammation regulatory genes, including TNF, CSF2, IL2RA, IL1B, IL4, IL6 and IL10. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that the combined gene set showed an increased connectivity as compared to COVID-19 or GBS alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with CD86, IL23A, IL27, ISG20, PTGS2, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and ITGAM, and these genes are related to Th17 cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19 and GBS further demonstrated the activation of interleukin-17 signalling in both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine response was identified in both COVID-19 and GBS. PBMC transcriptome analysis also suggested the pivotal involvement of Th17 signalling pathway. In conclusion, our data suggested aberrant Th17 cell differentiation as a possible mechanism by which COVID-19 can increase the risk of GBS.","output":"Bioinformatic analyses hinted at augmented T helper 17 cell differentiation and cytokine response as the central mechanism of COVID-19-associated Guillain-Barr syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermoscopy is a non-invasive technique, and its role in dermatology is similar to that of fundoscopy in ophthalmology and otoscopy in otolaryngology.

The present study aims to evaluate online teaching in political science from a students perspective. Based on a quantitative online survey, an evaluation of sub-facets of online teaching compared with classroom teaching has been measured. Moreover, three impact factors on the global evaluation level have been identified and tested. Study constraints are supposed to influence online teaching evaluation negatively. Dialogue with lecturers as well as social exchange with fellow students are assumed to have a favourable effect. A mediating role of academic exhaustion is hypothesised to explain the effect of these factors on teaching evaluations both for online lectures and online seminars. Our data support the assumed negative effect of study constraints on teaching evaluation and a positive effect of social exchange. Dialogue with lecturers has no significant impact. While the relationship between study constraints and evaluation is fully mediated, the impact of social exchange is partly mediated by academic exhaustion. These interrelationships are evident for both online lectures and online seminars.

For patients with acute leukemia and aggressive lymphomas, delaying curative chemotherapy treatments has historically been associated with adverse outcomes. In the absence of any quality prospective data, expert recommendation has been to treat when possible. Though earlier studies have reported that cancer patients are at an increased risk for mortality due to COVID-19 when compared to the general population, questions remain unanswered as to how specific agents used to treat malignancies affect the natural history of COVID-19. In particular, the effect of anti-CD20 therapy in patients with lymphoid malignancies remains unexplored in patients who contract COVID-19 during their treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients at our New York-based institution to identify any COVID-19 positive patients that required inpatient treatment for their lymphoid malignancy from December 31st, 2019 to July 31st, 2020. Only patients that had received anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab or obinutuzumab) were included in this study. COVID-19 positivity was determined via a positive PCR-based test (either nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage). Results: A total of 13 patients were identified, with primary hematological diagnoses including DLBCL (6), ALL (1), MALT lymphoma (1), follicular lymphoma (2), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1). The COVID-19 related mortality rate in this cohort was 46% (6), with the remainder recovering from COVID-19. Of the 7 patients who survived, 2 patients had persistently positive COVID-19 PCR-based testing after clinical recovery, 2 failed to develop detectable IgG anti-COVID-19 antibodies, 1 had not had antibody testing, and 2 had detectable antibodies. Of the 2 patients that developed antibodies after recovery, 1 had undetectable anti-COVID-19 IgG levels 55 days later on subsequent testing. Conclusions: Patients who are hospitalized with lymphoid malignancies and are requiring anti-CD20 therapy seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Furthermore, anti-CD20 therapy appears to adversely impact the development of IgG antibodies and appears to be associated with delayed clearance of the virus on PCR-based testing.

These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently circulating HPeV lineages. RESULTS: Our estimates reveal that human parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21  10(-3 )(0.48 C 4.21  10(-3)) and 2.79  10(-3 )(2.05 C 3.66  10(-3)) substitutions per site per year. These are within the range estimated for other picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be at around 1600 (1427C1733). In addition, by looking at the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within the VP1 gene we show that purifying selection constitutes the dominating evolutionary force leading to strong amino acid conservation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our estimates provide a timescale for the evolution of HPeVs and suggest that genetic diversity of current circulating HPeV types has arisen about 400 years ago.","output":"Rooting human parechovirus evolution in time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an increasing demand for online psychological intervention.

The Impact of Event ScaleRevised, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 7-item were administered. After participants had used the internet-based solution, the System Usability Scale was administered. In total, 221 patients (194 patients supported by internet-based interventions and 27 patients supported onsite) were included in intervention group, and 194 patients were included in CG. In a 6-month follow-up, participants in the I-IG demonstrated significant improvements in terms of PTSD risk (p < 0.0001, d = 0.64), depression (p < 0.0001, d = 0.68), and anxiety (p < 0.0001, d = 1.33), compared to the CG.

Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, but early clinical studies found no benefit treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention, as opposed to treatment, of COVID-19 mortality. Methods. We pre-specified and conducted an observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, representing 40% of the general population in England. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in England and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings. Of 194,637 patients with RA or SLE, 30,569 (15.7%) received []2 prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine in the six months prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 13 July 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0.23% (95% CI 0.18-0.29) among users and 0.22% (95% CI 0.20-0.25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0.008% (95% CI -0.051-0.066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunuosuppressives, and geographic region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressives. Quantitative bias analyses indicated observed associations were robust to missing information regarding additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation.

The stochastic model is formulated by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that is derived based on the ODE model with constant parameters. The nonlinear CTMC model is approximated by a multitype branching process to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of a disease outbreak. The local and global dynamics of the disease are analyzed by using the deterministic model with constant parameters, and the result indicates that the basic reproduction number $ \\\\mathcal{R}_0 $ serves as a sharp disease threshold: the disease dies out if $ \\\\mathcal{R}_0\\\\le 1 $ and persists if $ \\\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. In contrast to the deterministic dynamics, the stochastic dynamics indicate that the disease may not persist when $ \\\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. Parameter estimation and validation are performed to fit our ODE model to the public reported data. Our result indicates that both the exposed and infected classes play an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.

BACKGROUND: Preceptorship is a dynamic educational process that requires designing, and implementing various teaching strategies, evaluation, assessment and feedback. Web-based learning has been recognized as an effective learning approach for nursing professional development. DESIGN: A prospective quasi-experimental approach with two-group pre-test and post-test repeated measures was adopted. METHODS: The web-based clinical pedagogy program was provided to the preceptors in the experimental group, while control group received the face-to-face preceptorship course. Clinical Teaching Competence Inventory (CTCI), Preceptor Self-efficacy Assessment Instrument (PSEQ), and Attitudes toward Web-based Continuing Learning Survey (AWCLS) were used to evaluate preceptors' learning outcomes. Data were collected at three time points - before, immediately after the learning program, and after 6 months of the clinical teaching experience. RESULTS: A total of 150 nurses (75 participants/group) were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Singapore from July 2018 to June 2020. The results from the repeated measures analysis of covariance showed that there was a significant interaction effect (group x time) on the overall CTCI score after adjusting for covariate (F = 5.390, p = 0.005).

An increase in government purchases raises aggregate demand, tightens the labor market and reduces unemployment. This in turn lowers unemployment risk and thus precautionary saving, leading to a larger response of private consumption than in a model with perfect insurance. The output multiplier is further amplified through a composition effect, as the fraction of high-consumption households in total population increases in response to the spending shock. These features, along with the matching frictions in the labor market, generate significantly larger multipliers in recessions than in expansions. As the pool of job seekers is larger during downturns than during expansions, the concavity of the job-finding probability with respect to market tightness implies that an increase in government spending reduces unemployment risk more in the former case than in the latter, giving rise to countercyclical multipliers.","output":"Taking off into the Wind: Unemployment Risk and State-Dependent Government Spending Multipliers()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In-system clinical laboratories have proven themselves to be a fundamentally important resource to their institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic of the past year.

Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the virus, publicizing contact trace data raises concerns about individuals' privacy. In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th JanC20th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of identifiability in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.","output":"Too Much Information: Assessing Privacy Risks of Contact Trace Data Disclosure on People With COVID-19 in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Als Reaktion der EU auf die sozio?konomischen Folgen der Corona-Pandemie hat die Europ?ische Kommission am 27.

Using a two-step quench protocol, we effectively control the cooling rates, $r_1$ and $r_2$, during and after passing through the critical region, respectively, and measure the number of quantum vortices spontaneously created in the system. The latter cooling rate $r_2$ regulates the temperature during the condensate growth, consequently controlling the early coarsening dynamics in the defect formation. We find that the defect number shows a scaling behavior with $r_2$ regardless of the initial cooling rate $r_1$, indicating universal coarsening dynamics in the early stage of condensate growth. Our results demonstrate that early coarsening not only reduces the defect density but also affects its scaling with the quench rate, which is beyond the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.","output":"Universal Early Coarsening of Quenched Bose Gases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike conventional antimicrobials, the study of bacterial resistance to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) remains in its infancy and the mechanism(s) through which it evolves are limited and inconclusive.

Here, we show a specific resistance in an Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 strain to subinhibitory concentrations of AgNPs, and not Ag(I) ions, as indicated by a statistically significant greater-than-twofold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration occurring after eight repeated passages that was maintained after the AgNPs were removed and reintroduced. Whole-population genome sequencing identified a cusS mutation associated with the heritable resistance that possibly increased silver ion efflux.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive admissions to ED from 1(st) January to 9(th)April, in both 2019 and 2020. According to the ED discharge ICD-9-CM code, patients were grouped in urological and respiratory patients. We evaluated the type of access (self-presented/ambulance), discharge priority code, ED discharge (hospitalization, home), need for urological consultation or urgent surgery. RESULTS: The number of urological diagnoses in ED was inversely associated to COVID-19 diagnoses (CI 95% -0.41/-0.19; Beta=-0.8; p<0.0001). The average access per day was significantly lower after 10(th) March 2020 (1.51.1 vs 6.52.6; p<0.0001), compared to reference period. From 11(th) March 2020, the inappropriate admissions to ED were reduced (10/45 vs 96/195; p=0.001). Consequently, the patients admitted were generally more demanding, requiring a higher rate of urgent surgeries (4/45 vs 4/195; p=0.02). This reflected in an increase of the hospitalization rate from 12.7% to 17.8% (Beta=0.88; p<0.0001) during 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Urological admissions to ED during lockdown differed from the same period of 2019 both qualitatively and quantitatively. The spectrum of patients seems to be relatively more critical, often requiring an urgent management. These patients may represent a challenge due to the difficult circumstances caused by the pandemic.","output":"How the COVID-19 wave changed emergency urology: results from an academic tertiary referral hospital in the epicenter of the Italian red zone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study extends our understanding of the influence of proximity to retail grocery provision on housing rental prices. To achieve this, extensive data on the size and location of retail outlets are combined with neighbourhood rental values for small areas across a two year period, together with varied contextual data for each area. In order to control the influence of many confounding variables in the determination of housing rentals, the technique of propensity score matching is applied. This provides a sophisticated means for the comparison between areas where there is substantial natural variation, rather than manageable controls. For a variety of types of retail brands, only a significant relationship is found between the proximity of a Premium retail outlet and the housing rental value.

Traditional and conventional blood tests are recommended for screening the suspected patients; however, applying these tests could have health side effects and expensive cost. The goal of this study was to establish a simple and reliable predictive model based on the risk factors associated with diabetes using a decision tree algorithm. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was used in this study. A total of 10,436 participants who had a health check-up from January 2017 to July 2017 were recruited. With appropriate data mining approaches, 3454 participants remained in the final dataset for further analysis. Seventy percent of these participants (2420 cases) were then randomly allocated to either the training dataset for the construction of the decision tree or the testing dataset (30%, 1034 cases) for evaluation of the performance of the decision tree. For this purpose, the cost-sensitive J48 algorithm was used to develop the decision tree model. RESULTS: Utilizing all the key features of the dataset consisting of 14 input variables and two output variables, the constructed decision tree model identified several key factors that are closely linked to the development of diabetes and are also modifiable. Furthermore, our model achieved an accuracy of classification of 90.3% with a precision of 89.7% and a recall of 90.3%.

Adding on to the already existing burnout, an increase in incidents of violence and aggression against HCWs was seen in Pakistan and globally. Objectives: Primarily to review cases of violence against HCWs in Pakistan, highlighting and comparing the instigating factors seen within the country and globally. Secondly, to enlist possible interventions to counter workplace violence in healthcare during a pandemic and in general. Methods: Incidents of violence towards HCWs in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between April 7, 2020, and August 7, 2020, were included. The incidents reported from local newspapers were reviewed. Findings and Conclusion: A total of 29 incidents were identified, with perpetrators of violence most commonly being relatives of COVID-19 patients. Most frequent reasons included mistrust in HCWs, belief in conspiracy theories, hospitals' refusal to admit COVID-19 patients due to limited space, COVID-19 hospital policies, and the death of the COVID-19 patients. Protests by doctors and other HCWs for provision of adequate PPE, better quarantine conditions for doctors with suspected COVID-19, and better compensation for doctors on COVID-19 patient duty resulted in police violence towards HCWs. To avoid such incidents in the future, institutions, healthcare policymakers, media organisations, and law enforcement agencies must work together for widespread public awareness to counter misconceptions and to exhibit responsible journalism. In hospitals, measures such as de-escalation training and increased security must be implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must be trained in non-violent methods of crowd dispersal and control to manage peaceful protests by HCWs over legitimate issues.","output":"Violence against Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review of Incidents from a Lower-Middle-Income Country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily targets the respiratory system. This study describes the characteristics associated with mortality among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a single hospital in Baguio City, Philippines. METHODS: We reviewed medical records (including history, laboratory results and treatment regimen) of 280 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital during MarchCOctober 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (frequency and type of complication, recovery rate and mortality) were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of COVID-19 patients was 48.4 years and the female-to-male ratio was 1.8:1. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes were the most frequent comorbidities reported. Common presenting symptoms were respiratory and constitutional, with 41% of patients not reporting symptoms on admission. Patients with moderate, severe and critical disease comprised 45%, 8% and 4%, respectively. A total of 15% had complications, health care-associated pneumonia being the most frequent complication. The recovery rate was 95%; 5% of patients died, with multiorgan failure being the most common cause. The presence of CVD, chronic kidney disease, prolonged prothrombin time and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were associated with mortality. DISCUSSION: Most COVID-19 patients in our population had asymptomatic to moderate disease on admission. Mortality from COVID-19 was associated with having CVD, chronic kidney disease, elevated LDH and prolonged prothrombin time.

Clinical and laboratory parameters before and after transfusion were compared in two B-cell-depleted patients and four B-cell sufficient patients (control group). RESULTS: Both B-cell-depleted patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 virus and survived, while all other patients died within 14 days from intervention despite maximal therapeutic efforts. D-dimer levels increased in both cohorts subsequent to CPT. In control patients, mean Interleukin-6 increased and platelet levels decreased as opposed to decreasing and stable levels in B-cell-depleted patients, respectively. Control patients required increased doses of vasopressor compared to decreasing doses in B-cell depleted patients subsequent to CPT. PO(2)/FiO(2) decrease was more pronounced and respiratory deterioration required postinterventional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in two control patients. Transpulmonary thermodilution revealed a further increase of the Extravascular Lung Water Index upon CPT in control patients.

We describe a rapidly implemented COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The 'COVID-adapted pathway' integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting 'high-risk' symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as 'urgent suspicious of cancer'. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019 (3.3%). Compared with the period 1 April-31 May in 2017-2019, we observed a 43% reduction in all primary care referrals (1071 referrals expected reducing to 609). CONCLUSION: This COVID-adapted pathway mitigated the adverse effects on diagnostic capacity and detected cancer at the expected rate within those referred.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P < 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.","output":"Characterizing the rapid spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) through an animal food manufacturing facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The urban history that has given way to the so-called \\"Madrid, New North\\" begins at the end of the last century when around the nineties, a comprehensive remodeling that completely transforms its appearance is being studied for the Madrid Chamartin station and its surroundings.

Fatal outcomes in patients with these characteristics are due to a dysfunctional immune response. Understanding COVID-19's immunopathogenesis helps in designing strategies to prevent and mitigate complications during treatment. OBJECTIVE Describe the main immunopathogenic alterations of COVID-19 in patients of advanced age or with chronic non-communicable diseases. DATA ACQUISITION We carried out a bibliographic search of primary references in PubMed, Elsevier, Science Direct and SciELO. A total of 270 articles met our initial search criteria. Duplicate articles or those unrelated to at least one chronic comorbidity, senescence or inflammation and those that studied only patient clinical characteristics, laboratory tests or treatments were excluded. Finally, our selection included 124 articles for analysis: 10 meta-analyses, 24 original research articles, 67 review articles, 9 editorials, 9 comments, 3 books and 2 websites. DEVELOPMENT Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Risk of developing severe manifestations of the disease, including death, is increased in senescent and obese patients and those with cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-grade chronic inflammation is characteristic of all these conditions, reflected in a pro-inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and changes to innate immunity; mainly of the monocyte-macrophage system with changes in polarization, inflammation, cytotoxicity and altered antigenic presentation. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mechanisms involved in acute inflammation overlap with the patient's pro-inflammatory state, causing immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection amplifies already-existing alterations, causing failures in the immune system's control mechanisms. The resulting cytokine storm causes an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response marked by high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with decompensation of underlying diseases. In asthma, chronic eosinophilic inflammation protects against infection by producing a reduced interferon-mediated response and a reduced number of ACE2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS Low-grade chronic inflammation present in advanced age and chronic diseases-but not in bronchial asthma-produces a pro-inflammatory state that triggers a dysregulated immune response, favoring development of severe forms of COVID-19 and increasing lethality.","output":"Implications of Low-grade Inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 Immunopathology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a Bayesian inference framework to quantify uncertainties in epidemiological models.

A key unknown to predict the evolution of the epidemic is the fraction of the population affected by the virus, including asymptomatic subjects. Our study tracks its time evolution with quantified uncertainty from available official data from the onset of the epidemic, limited, however, by the data quality. We exemplify the technique with data from Spain, country in which late drastic lockdowns were enforced for months. In late actions and in the absence of other measures, spread is delayed but not stopped unless a large enough fraction of the population is confined until the asymptomatic population is depleted.

Patients with NLPHL that later transformed were older and showed IgD negativity, absence of the characteristic IGHV3/IGHD3/IGHJ6 lymphocyte-predominant rearrangement and high repertoire clonality. We constructed phylogenetic trees within the compartment of the malignant clone to investigate clonal evolution. In all relapsing cases, the lymphocyte-predominant rearrangement was identical at diagnosis and relapse. NLPHL cases with transformation showed more complex trajectories with strong intraclonal diversification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty tests were performed (16.94 m(2) room without ventilation with constant temperature (26.7 (1.1) C and humidity (56.53 (4.20)%)). Data were collected 2 min before, 2 min during, and 6 min after AGPs. The EOS device and the air sampler for particle counting were placed 0.35 m from the open mouth of a manikin head. The particle number concentration (PN, counts/m3) was measured to calculate PN (PN = [post-PN] ? [pre-PN]). RESULTS: Mean PN (SD) ranged between ?8.65E+06 (2.86E+07) counts/m(3) for 0.15 m and 6.41E+04 (2.77E+05) counts/m(3) for 1.0 m particles. No significant differences were found among the AGP groups (p > 0.05) or between the AGP and control groups (p > 0.05). With an EOS device, lower PN was detected for smaller particles by high-speed tooth preparation (0.1C0.3 m; p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: A greater reduction in the number of smaller particles generated by the EOS device was found for high-speed tooth preparation. Low PN by all AGPs demonstrated the efficacy of high-flow suction. CONCLUSIONS: The additional use of an EOS device should be carefully considered when performing treatments, such as high-speed tooth preparation, that generate particularly small particles when more people are present and all other protective options have been exhausted.","output":"The efficacy of an extraoral scavenging device on reducing aerosol particles  5 m during dental aerosol-generating procedures: an exploratory pilot study in a university setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a host cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has infected more than six million people worldwide and has caused more than 370,000 deaths as of May 31, 2020. An investigation of ACE2 expression in human tissues may provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified pathways associated with ACE2 expression and gene co-expression networks of ACE2 in pan-tissue based on the gene expression profiles in human tissues. We found that the pathways significantly associated with ACE2 upregulation were mainly involved in immune, stromal signature, metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and cancer and other diseases. The number of genes having a significant positive expression correlation with ACE2 in females far exceeded that in males. The estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR) genes had a significant positive expression correlation with ACE2 in pan-tissue. Meanwhile, the enrichment levels of immune cells were positively associated with the expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2 , while they were inversely associated with the expression levels of AR in pan-tissue and in multiple individual tissues.

Women have limited retirement resources due to their unequal work experience, and older women with access to fewer retirement resources often postpone their retirement. This research examined how the timing of older womens retirement was influenced by their retirement resources as well as their marital status. The study used 2014 HRS and RAND data, and collected sample of women aged 50-62 years old who worked either full or part time (n=3,593). Respondents were female (56%), white (63%), married (70%), and working full time (82%). Guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), multiple regression analysis examined gender differences in predicting older adults' retirement timing. TPB included three sub factors: attitudes toward retirement, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Logistic regression analyzed the effects of respondents expectations of retirement (i.e., with vs without expected timing). The findings indicated that the TPB model works similarly for men and women but there is a difference according to marital status. Unmarried women are less likely to have accumulated financial resources and more likely to anticipate a later retirement (1.4 years) than married women and are also less likely to set an expected timing for retirement (p<05). Such a robust research agenda would provide key information for government agencies and policymakers and contribute to the development of retirement planning models or retirement education programs for older women.","output":"The Impact of Retirement Resources on U.S. Older Female Workers Retirement Timing: Theory of Planned Behavior Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The rapid diffusion of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Northern Italy led Italian government to dictate national lockdown since March 12th 2020 to May 5 th 2020.

Methods: : The pediatric population was divided in a Pandemic group (PG) and Non-Pandemic group (NP). Sex, age, triage color-code at admission, declared cause of trauma and presence of symptoms related to COVID-19 infection, discharge diagnosis and discharge modes were investigated. Results: : The Lockdown period led to a reduction of 87.0% in the ER admissions with a particular decrease in patients older than 12 years old from 41.8% in NG to 22.3% in PG. Moreover, a trend towards more severe codes was observed in the PG and the diagnosis of fracture was less frequent in NG (p<0,0001) and injuries at home were more frequent (34.8% compared to 6.8% in NG). Conclusions: : A significant decrease in the ER attendances in our Trauma Hub center was reported after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to show how the virus kidnaps the mitochondrial machinery for its benefit and survival, leading to alterations of serum parameters and to nitrosative stress (NSS). In a prospective cohort of 15 postmortem patients who died from COVID-19, six markers of mitochondrial function (COX II, COX IV, MnSOD, nitrotyrosine, Bcl-2 and caspase-9) were analyzed by the immune colloidal gold technique in samples from the lung, heart, and liver. Biometric laboratory results from these patients showed alterations in hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, urea nitrogen, glucose, C-reactive protein, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, Ca2a?o, Ka?o, lactate and troponin. These changes were associated with alterations in the mitochondrial structure and function. The multi-organ dysfunction present in COVID-19 patients may be caused, in part, by damage to the mitochondria that results in an inflammatory state that contributes to NSS, which activates the sepsis cascade and results in increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The kidnapping of mitochondrial function associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public in Egypt during the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate whether environmental contamination may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: Air samples were collected by natural precipitation, and environmental surface samples were collected by conventional surface swabbing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Viral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples. The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P<0.05). The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and ICU, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between them (P=0.238).

Subscription-based payment models (SBPMs), wherein states contract with a single manufacturer to supply prescriptions at a reduced price, may offer a solution that increases access. Whether SBPMs are associated with changes in HCV medication use is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in Medicaid-covered HCV prescription fills after Louisiana and Washington implemented SBPMs on July 1, 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study examined trends in prescription fills of Medicaid-covered direct-acting antiviral HCV medications in Louisiana and Washington after implementation of SBPMs. A synthetic control approach was used to compare changes in HCV prescription fills between states that did and did not implement SBPMs. The unit of analysis was state-quarter. Outpatient direct-acting antiviral HCV prescription fills from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data files were obtained from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2020. EXPOSURES: Implementation of SBPMs for Medicaid-covered direct-acting antiviral HCV medications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Direct-acting antiviral HCV prescriptions filled per 100 000 Medicaid enrollees. RESULTS: In the year preceding SBPM implementation, the mean (SD) rate of quarterly HCV prescription fills per 100 000 Medicaid enrollees was 43.1 (8.6) prescriptions in Louisiana and 50.1 (4.1) in Washington. After SBPM implementation, the mean (SD) rate of quarterly HCV prescription fills per 100 000 enrollees was 206.0 (51.2) prescriptions in Louisiana and 53.9 (11.0) in Washington. In synthetic control models, SBPM implementation in Louisiana was associated with an increase of 173.5 (95% CI, 74.3-265.3) quarterly prescription fills per 100 000 Medicaid enrollees during the following year, a relative increase of 534.5% (95% CI, 228.7%-1125.0%). Washington did not experience a significant change in prescription fills following SBPM implementation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, Louisiana experienced substantial increases in HCV medication use among its Medicaid-enrolled population following SBPM implementation, whereas Washington did not. These differences may partially be explained by state-level variation in SBPM implementation, historical restrictions on access to HCV medications, and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Medicaid Subscription-Based Payment Models and Implications for Access to Hepatitis C Medications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has been associated with the subsequent development of recurrent wheezing and asthma, although the mechanisms involved are still unknown. We investigate the role of epigenetics in the respiratory morbidity after infection by comparing methylation patterns from children who develop recurrent wheezing (RW-RSV), subsequent asthma (AS-RVS), and those experiencing complete recovery (CR-RSV). Methods Prospective, observational study of infants aged < 2 years with RSV respiratory infection admitted to hospital and followed-up after discharge for at least three years. According to their clinical course, patients were categorized into subgroups: RW-RSV (n = 36), AS-RSV (n = 9), and CR-RSV (n = 32). The DNA genome-wide methylation pattern was analyzed in whole blood samples, collected during the acute phase of the infection, using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850K CpG sites). Differences in methylation were determined through a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender and cell composition. Results Patients who developed respiratory sequelae showed a statistically significant higher proportion of NK and CD8T cells (inferred through a deconvolution approach) than those with complete recovery. We identified 5,097 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) when comparing RW-RSV and AS-RVS together against CR-RSV. Methylation profiles affect several genes involved in airway inflammation processes. The most significant DMPs were found to be hypomethylated in cases and therefore generally leading to overexpression of affected genes. The lead CpG position (cg24509398) falls at the gene body of EYA3 (P-value = 2.7710-10), a tyrosine phosphatase connected with pulmonary vascular remodeling, a key process in the asthma pathology. Logistic regression analysis resulted in a diagnostic epigenetic signature of 3-DMPs (involving genes ZNF2698, LOC102723354 and RPL15/NKIRAS1) that allows to efficiently differentiate sequelae cases from CR-RSV patients (AUC = 1.00). Enrichment pathway analysis reveals the role of the cell cycle checkpoint (FDR P-value = 4.7110-2), DNA damage (FDP-value = 2.5310-2), and DNA integrity checkpoint (FDR P-value = 2.5610-2) in differentiating sequelae from CR-RSV patients. Conclusions Epigenetic mechanisms might play a fundamental role in the long-term sequelae after RSV infection, contributing to explain the different phenotypes observed.","output":"Role and Diagnostic Performance of Host Epigenome in Respiratory Morbidity after RSV Infection: The EPIRESVi Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is a global pandemic with higher mortality and morbidity than any other virus in the last 100 years. Without public health surveillance, policy makers cannot know where and how the disease is accelerating, decelerating, and shifting. Unfortunately, existing models of COVID-19 contagion rely on parameters such as the basic reproduction number and use static statistical methods that do not capture all the relevant dynamics needed for surveillance. Existing surveillance methods use data that are subject to significant measurement error and other contaminants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a proof of concept of the creation of surveillance metrics that correct for measurement error and data contamination to determine when it is safe to ease pandemic restrictions. We applied state-of-the-art statistical modeling to existing internet data to derive the best available estimates of the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. METHODS: Dynamic panel data (DPD) models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique enables control of various deficiencies in a data set. The validity of the model and statistical technique was tested. RESULTS: A Wald chi-square test of the explanatory power of the statistical approach indicated that it is valid (&#967;210=1489.84, P<.001), and a Sargan chi-square test indicated that the model identification is valid (&#967;2946=935.52, P=.59). The 7-day persistence rate for the week of June 27 to July 3 was 0.5188 (P<.001), meaning that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 5188 cases 7 days later. For the week of July 4 to 10, the 7-day persistence rate increased by 0.2691 (P=.003), indicating that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 7879 new cases 7 days later. Applied to the reported number of cases, these results indicate an increase of almost 100 additional new cases per day per state for the week of July 4-10. This signifies an increase in the reproduction parameter in the contagion models and corroborates the hypothesis that economic reopening without applying best public health practices is associated with a resurgence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: DPD models successfully correct for measurement error and data contamination and are useful to derive surveillance metrics. The opening of America involves two certainties: the country will be COVID-19-free only when there is an effective vaccine, and the \\"social\\" end of the pandemic will occur before the \\"medical\\" end. Therefore, improved surveillance metrics are needed to inform leaders of how to open sections of the United States more safely.

One of these pandemics occurred in Mexico in 2009. Despite the impact of IAV on human health, there is no effective vaccine. Gene mutations and translocation of genome segments of different IAV subtypes infecting a single host cell make the development of a universal vaccine difficult. The design of immunogenic peptides using bioinformatics tools could be an interesting strategy to increase the success of vaccines. In this work, we used the predicted amino acid sequences of the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of different IAV subtypes to perform multiple alignments, epitope predictions, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation. Peptide selection was based on the following criteria: promiscuity, protein surface exposure, and the degree of conservation among different medically relevant IAV strains. These peptides were tested using immunological assays to test their ability to induce production of antibodies against IAV. We immunized rabbits and mice and measured the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies in serum samples and nasal washes. Rabbit antibodies against the peptides P11 and P14 (both of which are hybrids of NA and HA) recognized HA from both group 1 (H1, H2, and H5) and group 2 (H3 and H7) IAV and also recognized the purified NA protein from the viral stock (influenza A Puerto Rico/916/34). IgG antibodies from rabbits immunized with P11 and P14 were capable of recognizing viral particles and inhibited virus hemagglutination. Additionally, intranasal immunization of mice with P11 and P14 induced specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and nasal mucosa, respectively. Interestingly, the IgG antibodies were found to have neutralizing capability. In conclusion, the peptides designed through in silico studies were validated in experimental assays.

A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a MIS-C case definition in May 2020, we implemented local diagnostic and management strategies to standardize the care for patients with MIS-C encouraging limited laboratory evaluation of non-toxic patients presenting with a febrile illness. We then sought to re-evaluate our diagnostic and management recommendations to ensure appropriate resource utilization for children with MIS-C and KD. METHODS: Patients with MIS-C and KD were identified via convenience sampling of Pediatric Infectious Diseases clinical records at Inova Childrens Hospital from May 1, 2020 to August 28, 2020. Manual chart review was done to extract clinical points of interest and the two cohorts were compared with descriptive statistics. Abdominal symptoms included pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Respiratory symptoms included shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, and need for mechanical ventilation. Musculoskeletal symptoms included pain and edema. Neurologic symptoms included headache, dizziness, altered mental status, and irritability. RESULTS: 7 patients with KD and 14 patients with MIS-C were identified. No patients with KD had presenting hypotension and 9 patients with MIS-C had presenting hypotension (p < 0.01). Oral changes were seen in 5 patients with KD and 3 patients with MIS-C (p = 0.05). Conjunctival injection, rash, abdominal symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms, and neurologic symptoms were seen in some patients with KD and MIS-C with no statistically significant occurrence of these symptoms between the two cohorts. The median initial absolute lymphocyte count was 2,860/L in KD cases whereas it was 1,325/L in MIS-C cases (p < 0.01). The median platelet count was 367,000/ L in KD cases versus 193,000 in MIS-C cases (p = 0.03). The median initial C-reactive protein was 11.2 mg/dL in KD cases versus 23.2 mg/dL in MIS-C cases (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alanine transaminase, B-natriuretic peptide, troponin I, or ferritin values between KD and MIS-C patients. Coronary artery dilation or prominence was seen in 4 patients with KD and in 8 patients with MIS-C (p > 0.99). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Following national recognition of MIS-C we saw approximately 1 MIS-C case per week. Presenting hypotension, an absolute lymphocyte count less than 1400/L, a platelet count less than 200,000/L, and a CRP greater than 20 mg/dL best predicted MIS-C versus KD. The initial white blood cell count, alanine transaminase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, B-natriuretic peptide, troponin I, ferritin, and initial coronary artery dilation did not readily distinguish KD from MIS-C. Thus, our diagnostic management recommending limited laboratory evaluation for non-toxic patients presenting with a febrile rash illness, fever and abdominal symptoms, or fever with conjunctival injection is reasonable.","output":"#25: Contemporaneous Evaluation of Kawasaki Disease and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Cases in Northern Virginia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.recesp.2020.11.015.].","output":"[Correction in article by Cosn-Sales et al. ?Telemedicine for patients with valvular heart disease or aortic disease in the era of COVID-19.

Electronic mental health (EMH) has been proposed as a solution to bridge the gap and better address the needs of young people. However, EMH is new to Egypt and its acceptability among target populations is crucial to its implementation and success. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore the interest of Egyptian youth in EMH, identify perceived barriers to EMH, and inform the design of EMH tools to best address the needs of youth. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed among medical students at Tanta University in Egypt. Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance tests were performed for inferential analyses using a significance level of .05. RESULTS: Of the 707 individuals who completed the survey (90.9% response rate), 60.5% (428) were female, 62% (438) lived in urban and suburban areas, and the mean age of the sample was 20.5 (SD 1.8) years. The vast majority of participants (522/707, 73.8%) had already used the internet to find information about mental health problems, but the information was unsatisfactory for about half of them (386/707, 54.6%). Almost all students reported that they would prefer web-based therapy if EMH were available through a trustworthy national web-based platform for youth mental health (601/707, 85%). Students believed that emotional difficulties, social support, and coping strategies were the main topics that EMH should help with. The most common perceived barriers for EMH use in Egypt were concerns about privacy (382/707, 54%) and a lack of technology literacy and unfamiliarity with EMH (352/707, 50%). CONCLUSIONS: EMH is a promising strategy for addressing gaps in the mental health care for young people. To construct and implement a digital system of care that addresses the unique needs and preferences of youth, adolescents and young adults should be involved in the co-development and design.","output":"Egyptian Students Open to Digital Mental Health Care: Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the importance of identifying misinformation is increasing, many researchers focus on verifying textual claims on the web. One of the most popular tasks to achieve this is fact verification, which retrieves an evidence sentence from a large knowledge source such as Wikipedia to either verify or refute each factual claim. However, while such problem formulation is helpful for detecting false claims and fake news, it is not applicable to catching subtle differences in factually consistent claims which still might implicitly bias the readers, especially in contentious topics such as political, gender, or racial issues. In this study, we propose ClaimDiff, a novel dataset to compare the nuance between claim pairs in both a discriminative and a generative manner, with the underlying assumption that one is not necessarily more true than the other. This differs from existing fact verification datasets that verify the target sentence with respect to an absolute truth.

The conventional approaches to prevent or treat this syndrome and its associated complications include a balanced diet, an increase energy expenditure, and lifestyle modification. Multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been developed with the aim of improving obesity complications. Recently, the use of functional foods and their bioactive components is considered a new approach in the prevention and management of this disease. Due to their biological properties, polyphenols may be considered as nutraceuticals and food supplement recommended for different syndromes. Polyphenols are a class of naturally-occurring phytochemicals, some of which have been shown to modulate physiological and molecular pathways involved in energy metabolism. Polyphenols could act in the stimulation of -oxidation, adipocyte differentiation inhibition, counteract oxidative stress, etc. In this narrative review, we considered the association between polyphenols (resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin, and some polyphenolic extracts) and obesity, focusing on human trials. The health effects of polyphenols depend on the amount consumed and their bioavailability. Some results are contrasting, probably due to the various study designs and lengths, variation among subjects (age, gender, ethnicity), and chemical forms of the dietary polyphenols used.

While the criteria for diagnosis have evolved since the first description in 1967, the characteristics of hypoxemia, tachypnea, rapidly progressing acute respiratory failure, and poor lung compliance continue. Scoring systems have been developed in an effort to quantify the severity of lung injury, with the most recent being the Berlin Definition. This system attempts to define acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS with more precision in terms of timing of disease onset, severity of disease, and chest radiograph findings. The number of reported cases of ALI/ARDS per year is lower in pediatric patients vs. adults; however, mortality rates continue to be high. Sepsis-related ARDS has a generally higher disease severity and poorer recovery period from lung injury with an increased mortality rate. ARDS results from an initial insult (direct and/or indirect) which triggers a series of cell-mediated responses leading to damage to the capillary endothelium, alveolar epithelium, and impaired fluid removal from the alveolar space. There is, however, gradual resolution of hypoxemia, lung function, and radiographic abnormalities in survivors of ARDS. Management of ARDS is mainly supportive with specific mechanical ventilation strategies and goal-directed therapies.

We examined the long-term effects of sheet materials using an animal pleural defect model. METHODS Beagles were used for this study. The 5-mm circular pleural defects were created at 2 sites on each of the anterior, medial, and posterior lobe and repaired using a 2 cm square sheet material. The frequency of adhesion of those sheets to the thoracic walls and histological changes was examined after 6 months. In this study, three types of sheet materials were examined: polyglycolic acid, nano-polyglycolic acid, and oxidized regenerated cellulose where each sheet was tested with or without coating with fibrin glue, for a total of 6 groups. Each group contained an equal number of defect sites and evaluation of 12 defect sites was conducted. RESULTS Adhesion was observed in 16 of 72 sites (22%). Presence or absence of adhesion was not affected by the repair method or by the type of sheet material used. However, the use of fibrin glue significantly reduced the occurrence of adhesion (p = 0.023). At the defected sites, the posterior lobe showed significantly less adhesion (p = 0.019). Histologically, the sheet materials caused a thickening of the pleural wall 6-10 times thicker than the normal pleural wall. CONCLUSION No statistically significant differences regarding the presence or absence of adhesion to the thoracic wall were found among the sheet materials.

METHODS: The MDS proposed in this study was developed in two-stepwise stages. First, an extensive literature review was performed in order to identify the potential data items. Then, we conducted a two-round Delphi stage to reach a consensus among experts regarding essential data items and a supplementary one-round Delphi stage for validating the content of the final MDS by calculating the individual item content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) and using other statistical tests. RESULTS: After the literature review, 189 data items were extracted and sent to a panel of experts in the form of a questionnaire. In the Delphi stage and CVI calculation, 55 and 10 experts participated in kappa and CVR calculation, respectively. Finally, the MDS of the suicide registry was finalized with 84 data elements that were classified into four categories, including patient profile, socio-economic status, clinical and psychopathological status, and suicide circumstances.

However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry.

All three MAbs were used to compare the Bucyrus isolate of EAV and MAb neutralization-resistant (NR) escape mutants with the vaccine virus and 19 independent field isolates of EAV by virus neutralization. The different abilities of the MAbs to neutralize virus isolates indicated that they recognize non-identical epitopes. Susceptibility to virus neutralization could not be used to distinguish viruses from acutely and persistently infected horses. Comparison of the ORF 5 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence from NR and neutralization-sensitive virus isolates revealed amino acid sequence changes at positions 99 and 100 which correlate with the NR phenotype. Additional unique changes in the amino acid sequence of MAb NR viruses at positions 96 and 113 may also contribute to neutralization resistance. The sequence data further showed that the Bucyrus-derived viruses contain one N-glycosylation site, whereas the field isolates DL8 and DL11 possess two sites, both of which are used. Most of the non-conservative amino acid sequence changes were located within the second half of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain. Sequence changes within the first half of the N-terminal ectodomain, the predicted transmembrane domain and the C-terminal hydrophilic domain were mainly silent base substitutions or resulted in conservative amino acid substitutions, suggesting that these regions of the protein are functionally conserved.","output":"Comparison of equine arteritis virus isolates using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and identification of sequence changes in GL associated with neutralization resistance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG), the only currently licenced tuberculosis vaccine, may exert beneficial non-specific effects (NSE) in reducing infant mortality.

METHODS: A total of 511 HCPs (202 physicians, 105 pharmacists, 100 advance practice nurses, 53 registered nurses, and 51 physician assistants) were surveyed through a third-party market research firm. All participants were practicing in the United States. Individuals working for a pharmaceutical company were excluded. The survey collected demographics, frequency of searching medical information, types of questions searched, sources of medical information, and rationale for preferred and nonpreferred sources of medical information. Use of medical information resources were rated on a 5-point ordinal scale. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 511 respondents, 88.5% (452/511) searched for medical information either daily or several times per week. The most common questions involved dosing and administration, drug-drug interactions, adverse events and safety, clinical practice guidelines, and disease state information. The main rationale for using specific medical websites or apps and general online search engines frequently or very frequently was ease of use (medical websites or apps: 269/356, 75.6%; general online search engines: 248/284, 87.3%). Accuracy was the main rationale for frequent or very frequent use of medical literature search databases (163/245, 66.5%), prescribing labels or information (122/213, 57.3%), and professional literature (120/195, 61.5%). The main reason for rarely or never using specific medical websites or apps and medical literature search databases was unfamiliarity (medical websites or apps: 16/48, 33%; medical literature search databases: 35/78, 45%); for general online search engines, inaccuracy (34/54, 63%); and for prescribing labels or information and professional literature, excessive time (prescribing labels or information : 54/102, 52.9%; professional literature: 66/106, 62.3%).

There is an opportunity to increase awareness of all the appropriate resources for HCPs which may aid in their daily clinical decisions. Specifically, pharmaceutical company medical information departments can help fulfill this need by addressing two major challenges with use of the pharmaceutical company: lack of awareness of medical information services and the speed at which responses are disseminated. Overall, there is lack of understanding or appreciation of the range of pathways to obtain published information and knowledge from pharmaceutical company medical information services.

However, about one of every five children suffering poverty in the United States has an unauthorized immigrant parent and thus little or no access to tax credits. That is nearly two million children, and 85 percent of them are US citizens. Achieving historic reductions in childhood poverty thus will be impossible without remedying the eligibility exclusions and bureaucratic impediments that unauthorized immigrants face in the US tax system.All individuals who make money and reside in the United States are obliged to pay federal income taxes via a return filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For unauthorized immigrants and others who do not qualify for a Social Security Number (SSN) that requires an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). In this two-tier system, ITIN filers have the same income tax due as Social Security filers, but they do not receive the same credits. ITIN filers have never been eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and some of their children were excluded from the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the Trump administration's 2017 tax bill. Both credits are highly effective anti-poverty programs, providing immediate relief while also incentivizing work and earnings. The tax credits are the critical policy tool in Biden's American Plan for reducing child poverty, and they would be funded through the budget reconicilation legislation devised by Congressional Democrats in the summer of 2021. As summer drew to a close, ITIN inclusion was beginning to enter the discussion among advocates and legislators about the bill's detailed provisions.But eligibility is not the only barrier. Internal government monitors have repeatedly criticized the IRS for heavy-handed and inefficient practices that have placed undue burdens on ITIN taxpayers and that have hindered compliance with the law. The use of ITINs has plummeted in recent years from a high of 4.6 million returns in 2014 to 2.5 million in 2020.Prompted by the economic losses and the medical toll suffered by unauthorized immigrants during the pandemic and by their newly valued roles as essential workers, the federal government and several state governments have taken important steps to lessen the exclusion of ITIN taxpayers. The first federal stimulus package excluded not only ITIN holders but also their family members with SSNs. Congress extended eligibility to members of ITIN households with SSNs for the second and third stimulus checks. Meanwhile, California, Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico, Washington, Maine, and Oregon broke with the federal government and made ITIN filers fully eligible for their state EITCs, and as of July 2021 similar measures were under consideration in four other states. Early evidence from California and Colorado suggests that ITIN inclusion could prove a highly effective means of reaching poor children with the benefits of a state EITC.Child poverty can only be attacked successfully if ITIN households receive equal access to federal and state tax credit programs. This can be accomplished if: Congress and state legislatures permit full eligibility for all EITC and CTC programs. Congress mandates reforms to the procedures for getting and keeping an ITIN that have been proposed in multiple reports to Congress by the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an internal monitor at the IRS. Immigrants rights advocates and other civil society organizations, with government support, undertake a multi-year campaign to encourage ITIN application and use. The IRS receives funding to support a greatly expanded ITIN program.","output":"Tax Equality for Immigrants: The Indispensable Ingredient for Remedying Child Poverty in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung disease is common throughout the world.

Therefore, we propose a new hybrid deep learning framework by combining VGG, data augmentation and spatial transformer network (STN) with CNN. This new hybrid method is termed here as VGG Data STN with CNN (VDSNet). As implementation tools, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, and Keras are used. The new model is applied to NIH chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle repository. Full and sample versions of the dataset are considered. For both full and sample datasets, VDSNet outperforms existing methods in terms of a number of metrics including precision, recall, F0.5 score and validation accuracy. For the case of full dataset, VDSNet exhibits a validation accuracy of 73%, while vanilla gray, vanilla RGB, hybrid CNN and VGG, and modified capsule network have accuracy values of 67.8%, 69%, 69.5% and 63.8%, respectively. When sample dataset rather than full dataset is used, VDSNet requires much lower training time at the expense of a slightly lower validation accuracy. Hence, the proposed VDSNet framework will simplify the detection of lung disease for experts as well as for doctors.","output":"Hybrid deep learning for detecting lung diseases from X-ray images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sanctioned prevention strategies have included frequent handwashing with soap and water, covering the mouth and nose with a mask when around others, cleaning and disinfecting maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others, etc. Although many of these recommendations are based upon observation and past infection control practices, it is important to combine and explore public data sets to identify predictors of infection, morbidity and mortality to develop more finely honed interventions, based on sociodemographic factors. METHOD: Cross-sectional study of both states in the US and counties in NY state. RESULTS: Population density was found to be significantly associated with state-level coronavirus infection and mortality rate (b = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34, 0.64, P < .0001). States that have lower socioeconomic status, lower mean age and denser populations are associated with higher incidence rates. In regard to NY state, counties with a higher percentage of minority residents had higher COVID-19 mortality rates (b = 2.61, 95% CI: 0.36, 4.87, P = 0.023). Larger population cohorts were associated with lower COVID-19 mortality rates after adjusting for other variables in the model (b = -1.39, 95% CI: -2.07, -0.71, P < 0.001). Population density was not significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality rates after adjustment across counties in the NY state. Public ridership was not indicative of cases or mortality across states in the USA; however, it is a significant factor associated with incidence (but not mortality) in NY counties. CONCLUSION: Population density was the only significant predictor of mortality across states in the USA. Lower mean age, lower median household incomes and more densely populated states were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Population density was not found to be a significant independent variable compared to minority status and socioeconomic factors in the New York epicenter. Meanwhile, public ridership was found to be a significant factor associated with incidence in New York counties.","output":"Sociodemographic predictors and transportation patterns of COVID-19 infection and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs) induce neutrophils proliferation and cytokines production.

Dendritically structured FeS2, synthesized via simple thermal sulfidation of electrodeposited dendritic -Fe, was formed into an electrode and cycled vs. lithium. The reversible capacities of the dendritic FeS2 cathode were 560 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and 533 mA h g-1 at 1.0C after 50 cycles over 0.7-3.0 V. Over 0.7-2.4 V, where the electrode is more stable, the reversible capacities are 348 mA h g-1 at 0.2C and 179 mA h g-1 at 1.0C after 150 cycles. The good cycling performance and high specific capacities of the dendritic FeS2 cathodes are attributed to the ability of a dendritic structure to provide good ion and electron conducting pathways, and a large surface area. Importantly, the dendritic structure appears capable of accommodating volume changes imposed by the lithiation and delithiation process. The presence of a Li2-x FeS2 phase is indicated for the first time by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).

Data were collected from 39 students who did not undertake prior preparation for engaging in distance education. Social presence, learning outcomes and satisfaction towards the course were measured by previous well-established scales, respectively. The students learning outcomes were evaluated through their code development. At the end of the course, the students filled out an online questionnaire which measured these three variables. The results of this study showed that all three variables were evaluated as satisfactory by the students. The results also indicated that social presence and code development were positively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that social presence and code development were critical factors affecting students satisfaction. Together, these two factors explain 39.9% of the variance of satisfaction. Social presence alone contributed about 32.3% of this variance, suggesting that it may be very important in predicting satisfaction.

METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using conventional content analysis method. Using semi-structured face-to-face interviews, data were collected from 15 older adults who had experienced of losing their adult child. Data analysis was performed according to the steps proposed by Graneheim and Lundman, 2004.

Abatement technologies such as ionic and other high efficiency filtration systems are expensive and unaffordable in communities with limited resources. The goal of this study was to develop a mask with an optimized nanoparticle coating which has a dual capability of particulate matter and virus filtration, while being affordable and safe for human use. The nanoparticles were selected for their filtration and virucidal capabilities. Particle filtration efficiency, tested with a wind tunnel and PM(2.5) from incense sticks measured by laser particle detectors, improved by ~60% with nanoparticle coatings on KN95 and surgical masks. Virus filtration efficiency, tested using nebulized NaCl particles as a virus surrogate, improved by 95% with coated masks. The nanoparticle retention efficacy, tested by simulating a normal 8-hour workday, was well within the permissible exposure limits. This technology has several applications such as in personal protective equipment for virus protection, and in air-conditioning and car cabin filters for pollution abatement.

Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization.

Though animal-derived heparin has been in use over eight decades, it is a complex mixture that poses a risk for chemical adulteration, and its availability is highly vulnerable. Therefore, there is an urgent need in devising bioengineering approaches for the production of heparin polymers, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and thus, relying less on animal sources. One of the main challenges, however, is the rapid, cost-effective production of low molecular weight heparosan, a precursor of LMWH and size-defined heparosan oligosaccharides. Another challenge is N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan oligosaccharides efficiently, an essential modification required for subsequent enzymatic modifications, though chemical and enzymatic N-sulfation is effectively performed at the polymer level. METHODS: To devise a strategy to produce low molecular weight heparosan and heparosan oligosaccharides, several non-pathogenic E. coli strains are engineered by transforming the essential heparosan biosynthetic genes with or without the eliminase gene (elmA) from pathogenic E. coli K5. RESULTS: The metabolically engineered non-pathogenic strains are shown to produce ~5a?kDa heparosan, a precursor for low molecular weight heparin, for the first time. Additionally, heparosan oligosaccharides of specific sizes ranging from tetrasaccharides to dodecasaccharides are directly generated, in a single step, from the recombinant bacterial strains that carry both heparosan biosynthetic genes and an eliminase gene. Various modifications, such as chemical N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan hexasaccharide following the selective protection reducing end GlcNAc residue, enzymatic C5-epimerization of N-sulfo heparosan tetrasaccharide and complete 6-O sulfation of N-sulfo heparosan hexasaccharide, are shown to be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: We engineered non-pathogenic E. coli strains to produce low molecular weight heparosan and a range of size-specific heparosan oligosaccharides in a controlled manner through modulating culture conditions. We have also shown various chemical and enzymatic modifications of heparosan oligosaccharides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Heparosan is a precursor of heparin and the methods to produce low molecular weight heparosan is widely awaited. The methods described herein are promising and will pave the way for potential large scale production of low molecular weight heparin anticoagulants in the coming decade.","output":"Metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strains for the controlled production of low molecular weight heparosan and size-specific heparosan oligosaccharides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article explores some of the biggest challenges to the ILO caused by globalization and altering of the collective labour rights scene.

This will in turn impact systems for and participation in lifelong learning. There is a risk for increased social inequalities, as neither telework nor lifelong learning is evenly distributed among workers. Statistics on telework in the EU show that there are differences between age groups, nations, sectors, and professions. If these trends will steer forward, there is a risk of widening gaps between countries, companies, and workers. To establish the current knowledge base, we have gathered literature reviews from several disciplines. One finding is that the previous literature on telework has not included lifelong learning in any form (formal, non-formal and informal). Based on a review of previous studies, we suggest a number of research questions for future research. This is relevant as research about telework and lifelong learning has the potential to contribute to a sustainable working life in terms of providing more flexible arrangements for employees and to support the lifelong learning that takes place in contexts such as the office, home, online meetings, and virtual reality.","output":"Telework and Lifelong Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital communications and e-commerce reshape corporate processes and add new risks to business activities.

The course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico has led to many fatal cases in younger patients attributable to cardio-metabolic conditions. Here, we aimed to perform an early spatial epidemiological analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico to evaluate how tested case-fatality risks (t-CFRs) are geographically distributed and to explore spatial predictors of early t-CFRs considering the variation of their impact on COVID-19 fatality across different states in Mexico, controlling for the severity of the disease. As results, considering health related variables; diabetes and obesity were highly associated with COVID-19 fatality. We identified that both external and internal migration had an important impact over early COVID-19 risks in Mexico, with external migration having the second highest impact when analyzing Mexico as a whole. Physicians-to-population ratio, as a representation of urbanity, population density, and overcrowding households, has the highest impact on t-CFRs, whereas the age group of 10 to 39 years was associated with lower risks. Geographically, the states of Quintana Roo, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tabasco had higher t-CFRs and relative risks comparing with a national standard, suggesting that risks in these states were above of what was nationally expected; additionally, the strength of the association between some spatial predictors and the COVID-19 fatality risks variates by zone depending on the predictor.","output":"Modelling the impact of health-related variables, age, migration, and socio-economic factors in the geographical distribution of early tested case-fatality risks associated with COVID-19 in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This retracts the article on p. 419 in vol. 36, PMID: 33487918.].","output":"Retraction: Convalescent plasma therapy in COVID 19: Every dark cloud has a silver lining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training on peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2 slope), muscle strength and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS We searched Cochrane, Pubmed, and PEDro (from the earliest date available to September 2018) for RCTs that evaluated the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training in HFrEF patients.

SETTING Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India DESIGN:: Experimental study METHODS:: 10 patients attending ophthalmic outpatient clinic(OPD) and operating room(OR) were included. Using Schlieren imaging, exhaled airflow patterns were documented with/without an N95 mask or face shield during respiratory activities. Recordings were performed with and without room air conditioning turned on. Exhaled airflow patterns in OPD and OR when using versus not using these infection control measures, as well as the impact of room air circulation on these were compared. RESULTS There was a forward stream of exhaled air from the patient's mouth/nose during all respiratory activities. An N95 mask dampened its intensity and forward transmission. Taping the mask around the nasal bridge further reduced airflow leakage. A mechanical barrier in front of the patient's face blocked forward propagation of the exhaled airflow. Turning on a forceful and direct draft of air over the surgeon's working area dampened and diverted the exhaled airflow away from the surgeons' breathing area. This effect was particularly pronounced in the OR, with the overhead laminar airflow. CONCLUSIONS Using a high force airflow with the draft facing downwards can dampen and divert the exhaled airflow away from healthcare providers.

Multilevel modelling showed increased mental health problems in children from Pre-pandemic to Pre-lockdown, and from Pre-lockdown to Lockdown. Mediation analyses indicated that the increase in childrens mental health problems from Pre-pandemic to Pre-lockdown was partially explained by a decrease in time spent outdoors, an increase in their conflict with fathers, and an increase in their mothers mental health problems, with the last factor being the only significant mediator when all three factors were considered simultaneously. The increase in childrens mental health problems from Pre-lockdown to Lockdown was partially explained by a further increase in their mothers mental health problems.

Both trials were able to enrol patients very rapidly during the beginning of the pandemic because of pre-established structures and procedures, and because they share simple execution and flexibility to adjust when evidence emergences. However, contracting, regulatory hurdles, and competition with (often inadequately designed or underpowered) national trials was a major challenge in several EU countries. We recommend the creation of structures and partnerships that facilitate prioritisation of clinical research, simplification of clinical trial delivery, development of digital models and procedures for data collection and sharing, development of a mechanism to rapidly leverage pandemic funding and to connect EU funding with national funding, and investment in clinical trial networks, platform trials, and master protocols. Finally, the future pandemic clinical research response of the EU should be embedded in the global response.

Egypt reported a low incidence of infection when compared with other countries. The aim of the study was to assess the characterization of COVID-19 infection among the Egyptian population. METHODOLOGY Data were collected from a single COVID-19 quarantine hospital in Cairo. A total number of 195 cases were included with their clinical, laboratory, and radiological data. RESULTS Three different age groups behaved differently for COVD-19 infection. The pediatric age group was asymptomatic entirely, the middle age group (18-50 years) were asymptomatic in 53.3% of cases, while 77.9% of those above 50 years were symptomatic (p  0.001). The latter group had a high incidence of COVID-pneumonia in (83.1%), and moderate to critical presentations were encountered in 66.3% of them. Neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio correlated directly with the age and case severity. C-reactive protein (CRP) and computed tomography scan chest (CT-chest) had added value on COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS In Egypt, patients above 50 years are at a higher risk for symptomatic COVID-19 infection and leaner for moderate to critical COVID-19 presentation. The triad of CT-chest, CRP, and N/L ratio could be an integrated panel for assessing disease severity.","output":"Clinical features and laboratory characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19: single centre report from Egypt."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the demand for telepsychiatry increases during the COVID-19 pandemic, the strengths and challenges of telepsychiatry implementation must be articulated to improve clinical practices in the long term. Currently, observations within US contexts are lacking; therefore, we report on the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry and workflow experiences in a psychiatric practice based within a large health care system in southeast Texas with a national catchment area. We discuss the logistics of the implementation, including modes of communication, scheduling, coordination, and capacity; the psychological effects of web-based services, including both the loss of the physical therapeutic environment and the unique interpersonal dynamics experienced in the virtual environment; and postadoption patterns of engagement with our services and with other clinical functions affected by the rapid adaptation to telemedicine. Our art therapy group programming serves as an applied case study, demonstrating the value of a well-managed web-based program (eg, patients were receptive and well-engaged, and they appreciated the continuity of accessible service) as well as the challenges (eg, the need for backup plans and technological fallbacks, managing interruptions and telecommunication learning curves, and working around the difference in resources for art and music therapy between a well-stocked clinical setting versus clients home spaces). We conclude from our experience that the overall strengths of telepsychiatry include receptive and well-engaged responses from patients as well as the expansion of boundaries, which provides a directly contextualized view into patients home lives. Challenges and corresponding recommendations include the need for more careful safety planning for high-risk patients; maintaining professional boundaries in the newly informal virtual setting; designing the physical space to both frame the patient encounter and maintain work-life balance for the therapist; allowing for delays and interruptions (including an initial acclimation session); and preserving interprofessional care team collaboration when the physical locations that normally facilitate such encounters are not accessible. We believe that careful observations of the strengths and challenges of telepsychiatry during this pandemic will better inform practices that are considering telepsychiatry adoption both within pandemic contexts and more broadly thereafter.","output":"Adapting an Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic to Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Practice Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic respiratory infectious disease COVID-19.

The Chi-square test and logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis, and the Fairlie model was used for decomposition analysis. The overall prevalence of smoking was 25.6%; the rate was much higher in men than in women (overall: OR = 26.234; urban: OR = 31.260; rural: OR = 23.889). The rate of correct responses to all questions on smoking problems was significantly higher among the urban elderly than the rural elderly. Further, 64.18% of the participants supported printing photos of the health hazards of smoking on the cover of cigarette packs, and the rural elderly were more supportive of this. Moreover, only 36.52% of the participants supported increasing taxation and retail price of cigarettes; the urban elderly showed more support for this. Rules about smoking at home also played an important role, especially for families where smoking was not allowed at home, but with exceptions to the rule; however, this factor was only meaningful in urban families (urban: OR = 0.117).

While most primary physicians offices were closed, hospitals prepared for a pandemic surge and emergency departments (EDs) stayed open to provide care for urgent needs. We sought to determine whether ED paediatric presentations prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic changed and review acuity compared with seasonal adjusted prior year. METHODS: We analysed records from 18 EDs in British Columbia, Canada, serving 60% of the population. We included children 0C16 years old and excluded those with no recorded acuity or discharge disposition and those left without being seen by a physician. We compared prepandemic (before the first COVID-19 case), early pandemic (after first COVID-19 case) and peak pandemic (during public health emergency) periods as well as a similar time from the previous year. RESULTS: A reduction of 57% and 70% in overall visits was recorded in the childrens hospital ED and the general hospitals EDs, respectively. Average daily visits declined significantly during the peak-pandemic period (167.4440.72) compared with prepandemic period (543.5358.8). Admission rates increased mainly due to the decrease in the rate of visits with lower acuity. Children with complaints of fever and gastrointestinal symptoms had both the largest overall volume and per cent reduction in visits between peak-pandemic and prior year (79% and 74%, respectively).

METHODS English-language articles studying changes in MEP as measured by tympanometry or tympanograms in patients using CPAP were selected for inclusion. Data extraction from included articles included demographics, baseline, and follow-up data. RESULTS A total of 7 articles representing 664 patients with weighted mean age of 42.5 years (range 34.9-57.8 yrs) were included.

Patients with KFRT have increased risk of developing COVID-19, and though initial reports suggested that mortality of these patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting is prohibitively high, those studies suffered from significant limitations. SUBJECT OF REVIEW: The Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) is a multicenter cohort study that enrolled adults with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in 68 medical centers across the USA. STOP-COVID investigators compared characteristics at the time of ICU admission and clinical outcomes in 143 patients with KFRT, 521 with nondialysis-dependent CKD (ND-CKD), and 3,600 patients without CKD. Patients with KFRT were less likely to have typical COVID-19 symptoms but more likely to have altered mental status at the time of ICU admission and were less likely to require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization than those without kidney disease. Approximately, 50% of patients with KFRT and ND-CKD died within 28 days of ICU admission, and in fully adjusted models, patients with KFRT and ND-CKD had 1.41- and 1.25-fold higher risk of 28-day mortality than those without CKD. Patients with KFRT and ND-CKD were also less likely to receive emerging therapies for COVID-19 than those without CKD. SECOND OPINION: This study provides important new data demonstrating differences in clinical presentation in patients with KFRT and ND-CKD with COVID-19. Alhough patients with severe CKD had higher mortality than those without CKD, approximately half survived after 28 days, demonstrating that patients with COVID-19 and severe CKD can benefit from ICU care. The markedly lower use of emerging COVID-19 treatments in patients with severe CKD highlights the need to include these patients in clinical trials of new COVID-19 therapies and for clinicians to ensure equal access to care in patients with severe CKD and COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of Chronic Kidney Disease on Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent infections caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have led to global panic and mortality.

Results: The different epidemic curves of COVID-19 revealed that crude incidence rates displayed larger differences between the two provinces compared to absolute counts. More notable differences between Ontario and Qubec were demonstrated when comparing crude rates of hospitalizations to crude rates of confirmed cases in each province. Crude daily hospitalizations revealed twice the magnitude of hospitalizations for Qubec from April to May when compared to Ontario. Conclusions: We recommend using crude rates of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality for COVID-19 epidemic curve comparison as they reveal important patterns in disease trends, and are more easily comparable between health jurisdictions. A harmonized approach to data presentation is important to not only accurately compare the progression of the pandemic, but also for interpretation of the media and the general public.","output":"Epidemic Curves and COVID-19: How to Reduce The Confusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improved sample preparation has the potential to address unmet needs for fast turnaround sepsis tests. In this work, we report elasto-inertial based rapid bacteria separation from diluted blood at high separation efficiency. In visco-elastic flows, we demonstrate novel findings where blood cells prepositioned at the outer wall entering a spiral device remain fully focused throughout the channel length while smaller bacteria migrate to the opposite wall. Initially, using microparticles, we show that particles above a certain size cut-off remain fully focused at the outer wall while smaller particles differentially migrate towards the inner wall. We demonstrate particle separation at 1 m resolution at a total throughput of 1 mL/min. For blood-based experiments, a minimum of 1:2 dilution was necessary to fully focus blood cells at the outer wall. Finally, E.coli spiked in diluted blood were continuously separated at a total flow rate of 1 mL/min, with an efficiency between 82 to 90% depending on the blood dilution. Using a single spiral, it takes 40 minutes to process 1 mL of blood at a separation efficiency of 82%.

In particular, we focus on multi-player, skill-based card games, and use Rummy as a case study. GAIM framework provides a novel and extensible encapsulation of the game state as an image, and uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn these images to calibrate the goodness of the state, in such a way that the challenges arising from multiple players, chance factors and large state space, are all abstracted. We show that our model out-performs well-known image classification models, and also learns the nuances of the game without explicitly training with game-specific features, resulting in a true state model, wherein most of the misclassifications can be attributed to user mistakes or genuinely confusing hands. We show that GAIM helps gather fine-grained insights about player behavior, skill, tendencies, and business implications, that were otherwise not possible, thereby enabling targeted services and personalized player journeys.

Absolute and relative frequencies described the sample, Chi-square and z-test tested associations between the variables, adopting p<0.05. RESULTS: Female (71.20%), young age -18 to 35 years (82.60%), students (76.10%), living in a family with 1 to 3 members during quarantine (55.40%) were more prevalent respondents. Women, young age, and students had a significantly higher rate of negative feelings in all psychological questions. Curiously, negative feelings during social distances affect the participants, independent of living quarantine alone or with family/friends during the COVID-19 outbreak.

In the USA, meaningful discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the Canadian system has been thwarted by ideological mudslinging on the part of large insurance companies seeking to preserve their ultra-profitable turf and backed by conservative political forces stirring up old fears of 'socialised medicine'. These distractions have relegated the possibility of a 'public option' to the legislative dustbin, leaving tens of millions of people to face uninsurance, under-insurance, bankruptcy and unnecessary death and suffering, even after passage of the Obama health plan. While South Africa appears to experience similar legislative paralysis, there remains room for reasoned health reform debate to address issues of equity, access, and financing. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to contribute to the debate from a Canadian perspective, setting out the basic principles of Medicare (Canada's health care system), reviewing its advantages and challenges, clarifying misunderstandings, and exploring its relevance to South Africa. We periodically refer to the USA because of the similarities to the South African situation, including its health care system, which mirrors South Africa's current position if left unchanged.

Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. After quality appraisal, data were extracted. Prevalence data from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 67 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a pooled population of 13 251 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were anorexia (10.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2%-16.4%), diarrhea (8.4%, 95% CI = 6.2%-11.2%), and nausea (5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%), respectively. Decreased albumin levels (39.8%, 95% CI = 15.3%-70.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (22.8%, 95% CI = 18.1%-28.4%), and alanine aminotransferase (20.6%, 95% CI = 16.7%-25.1%) were common hepatic findings. After adjusting for preexisting gastrointestinal (5.9%) and liver diseases (4.2%), the most common gastrointestinal findings were diarrhea (8.7%, 95% CI = 5.4%-13.9%), anorexia (8.0%, 95% CI = 3.0%-19.8%), and nausea (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.2%-14.3%).

The present study aimed to investigate the associated risk of T2D with obesity risk alleles of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) and melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) genes. METHODS: The study includes 400 subjects (300 T2D diabetic cases and 100 healthy controls). Genetic analysis was done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. RESULTS: The findings of the study show no significant increase in odds of diabetes associated with the prevalence of FTO and MC4R minor alleles. Rare allele frequencies for A of FTO rs9939609 were 0.34 and 0.30 in cases and controls, respectively. Rare allele frequencies for A of MC4R rs12970134 were found to be more common in controls (0.45) than cases (0.41), but the difference was insignificant (p 0.246); however, an increase in body weight with the presence of allele A of the FTO gene (p value < 0.001) was found, indicating indirect involvement in the development of T2D. In addition, these were also correlated with the demographic/lifestyle and clinico-pathological parameters between T2D cases and controls. We found that T2D patients with a history of smoking and high consumption of alcohol, fast foods and sweetened beverages are at high risk of T2D compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01*). CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that there is no direct association of rs9939609 of the FTO gene with the occurrence of diabetes in the Indian population, but its role in T2D development cannot be overlooked altogether. Furthermore, we conclude that the rs9939609 of FTO carries a potential risk of obesity and because of this FTO rs9939609 T > A is widely considered an obesity-associated allele/single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).","output":"Role of FTO and MC4R Polymorphisms in Escalating Obesity and Their Indirect Association With Risk of T2D in Indian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection is associated with a clear prothrombotic phenotype. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood, thrombosis is clearly a highly important in the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19. As such, there is a need for diagnostic analysis and quantification of the coagulation potential in these patients, both at diagnosis and follow-up. Global coagulation assays like thrombin generation (TG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) might be suitable in estimating COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk. Therefore, we aimed at validating both assays for samples with high levels of fibrinogen and in the presence of anticoagulant heparins, such as commonly observed for COVID-19 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) was optimized to assess plasma thrombin generation in the presence of heparins. The final conditions with either 10 g/mL Ellagic acid (EA) or PPP Reagent HIGH (high tissue factor; HPPH) were validated according to the EP5 protocol for within-run and between-run variability. Overall variability was well below 10%. To estimate the influences of heparins and high fibrinogen levels, CAT was performed on spiked plasma aliquots from 13 healthy volunteers. Comparable to the CAT method, tPA-ROTEM was used to validate the effect of high fibrinogen and heparins on clotting time, clot firmness and clot lysis parameters. RESULTS: Our adjusted COVID-19 assay showed a heparin dose dependent decrease in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) for both EA and HPPH triggered variants. High fibrinogen did not alter the inhibitory effect of either LMWH or UFH, nor did it influence the peak height or ETP in any of the conditions. The tPA-ROTEM showed a significant prolongation in clotting time with the additions of heparin, which normalized with the addition of high fibrinogen. MCF was markedly increased in all hyperfibrinogenemic conditions. A trend towards increased lysis time and, thus, decreased fibrinolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: Thrombin generation and tPA-ROTEM protocols for measurements in the COVID-19 populations were adjusted and validated. The adjusted thrombin generation assay shows good sensitivity for measurements in heparin spiked plasma. High levels of fibrinogen did not alter the assay or the effectiveness of heparins as measured in this assay. t-PA ROTEM was effective in measurement of both high fibrinogen and heparins spiked samples and was sensitive to the expected relevant coagulant changes by these conditions. No clear fibrinolytic effect was observed in different conditions.","output":"Suggestions for global coagulation assays for the assessment of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in China.

This paper investigates the impact of a 3D printed prosthesis on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in prosthesis recipients. METHODS: Patients with upper extremity amputations were included in this case study from December 2018 until July 2019. Data on the HRQoL was gathered until April 2020 in Masanga Hospital, central rural Sierra Leone. At two follow-up moments the HRQoL was assessed by applying the standard EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. These two follow-up moments varied between one week and just over a year after receiving the prosthesis. A second patient questionnaire was used to assess prosthesis satisfaction. RESULTS: Seven patients were included. The results of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire show no deterioration of the HRQoL in any patient and the overall HRQoL increased by almost 20% compared to the null measurement. One patient was lost to follow up after the first re-visit. The responses to the second questionnaire indicated that patients are satisfied with the prosthesis and use it in various situations. Patients often mentioned they feel more included in society when wearing the prosthesis. One patient says wearing the prosthesis helped in accepting the amputation. As a result, enough self-confidence was experienced without the prosthesis and the patients stopped wearing the prosthesis. DISCUSSION: The overall HRQoL in patients wearing a 3D-printed prosthesis increases compared to not wearing one. Assessing the HRQoL at regular intervals is important for the long-term follow-up and to safeguard sustainability and long-term success of this project. Nevertheless, defining the HRQoL is challenging due to cultural differences and misunderstandings. Therefore, the use of alternative questionnaires to define the HRQoL should be investigated. To improve and warrant long-term success, identifying long-term problems is important, and the second questionnaire accounts for this need.","output":"Quality of life of patients with 3D-printed arm prostheses in a rural area of Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. All-in/all-out operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.","output":"Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public Significance Statement The current study explored the ways that housing and employment instability brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to heightened psychological distress among a sample of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals collected using an online survey platform. Our findings indicate that TGD individuals experienced heightened levels of psychological distress directly related to employment and housing instability which is a crucial and timely concern given that TGD individuals experienced greater psychological distress, unemployment, and housing instability relative to the general population prior to the pandemic. Receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis or experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 also predicted heightened levels of psychological distress.

Most studies on incidence time trends were performed before the introduction of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs). Between 2008 and 2018, the number of OAC-users in the Netherlands increased by 63%, with the number of DOAC-users almost equaling that of Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA)-users. We aimed to determine the recent total and OAC-related ICH incidence and assess changes over the last decade, including the effect of DOAC introduction. METHODS: All adult non-traumatic ICH patients presenting in any of three hospitals in the enclosed region of South-Limburg, the Netherlands, were retrospectively included, during two 3-year time periods: 2007C2009 and 2017C2019. OAC-related ICH was defined as ICH in patients using VKAs or DOACs. We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between the two study periods. RESULTS: In the 2007C2009 period, we registered 652 ICHs of whom 168 (25.8%) were OAC-related (all VKA). In the 2017C2019 period, we registered 522 ICHs, 121 (23.2%) were OAC-related (70 VKA and 51 DOAC). In 2007C2009, the annual incidence of total ICH and OAC-related ICH was 40.9 and 10.5 per 100,000 person-years, respectively, which decreased to 32.4 and 7.5 per 100,000 person-years in 2017C2019. The IRR for total ICH and OAC-related ICH was 0.67 (95%-CI: 0.60C0.75) and 0.58 (0.46C0.73), respectively. CONCLUSION: Both total ICH and OAC-related ICH incidence decreased over the past decade in South-Limburg, the Netherlands, despite the aging population and increasing number of OAC-users. The introduction of DOACs, and possibly an improved cardiovascular risk management and change in OAC prescription pattern, could explain these findings.","output":"Decrease in incidence of oral anticoagulant-related intracerebral hemorrhage over the past decade in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Important methodological questions still exist concerning the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST), including the possibility of a better way of interpreting it. The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility of an alternative way of interpreting DST results. METHODS A total of 50 patients with major depression aged 41.0 +/- 11.4 years old participated in the study. Past and present suicide attempts were recorded. Psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), the Newcastle Depression Diagnostic Scale (NDDS), the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale (DMS) and the General Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. The 1 mg DST protocol was used. Analysis methods included the chi square test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with Fisher least significant difference (LSD) as post hoc tests. RESULTS In all, 34 patients (68%) were suppressors, 16 (32%) were non-suppressors and 14 patients had cortisol values above 5 microg/dl at baseline. Baseline cortisol level did not influence the classical DST interpretation. A total of 18 patients (36%) showed an increase of their cortisol levels after dexamethasone administration and 32 patients (64%) showed a decrease. Reducers had less melancholic features, similar levels of depression, better sleep and less suicidal thoughts in comparison to increasers. No relationship of DST to suicidality was found. DISCUSSION The present study explored the pattern of cortisol response to dexamethasone suppression and suggested an alternative way of coding and interpreting the DST on the basis of whether the cortisol levels remain stable or increase vs decrease after the administration of cortisol. The results put forward a complex way of understanding the relationship of the DST results with clinical symptoms.","output":"Revisiting the Dexamethasone Suppression Test in unipolar major depression: an exploratory study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has been previously exploited for viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia and Ebolavirus disease.

In this paper, we empirically explore the influence and mechanism of the demonstration effect of sports champions upon the COVID-19 epidemic using COVID-19-related dataset of prefecture-level cities in China from 1 January 2020 to 17 March 2020. The two-way fixed effect model of econometrics is applied to estimate the result, the instrumental variable approach is adopted to address potential endogeneity issues, and socio-economic factors including public health measures, residents self-protection awareness, effective distance from Wuhan are also taken into consideration. The results show that the demonstration effect of champions in major sporting events increases the participation in physical exercise, which in turn reduces the possibility of being infected with the epidemic. An increase of one gold medal results in a 0.93% increase in the sports population, then leads to a 3.58% decrease in the cumulative case growth rate (p < 0.01). Further, we find that the effect is greater in regions with developed economies and abundant sports resources.

Sequence comparison and mutational analysis revealed that the cysteine and glycine at position 8 and 14 of AYVV-TC C4 protein, respectively, are involved in the modulation of leaf curling symptoms. Cross-protection assays further demonstrated that N. benthamiana inoculated with AYVV-carrying mutations of the aforementioned amino acids exhibited attenuated leaf curling symptoms under the challenge of wild-type AYVV-NT. Together, these findings revealed a new function of begomovirus C4 proteins involved in the modulation of leaf curling severity during symptom formation and suggested potential applications for managing viral diseases through manipulating the symptoms.","output":"Identification of Crucial Amino Acids in Begomovirus C4 Proteins Involved in the Modulation of the Severity of Leaf Curling Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2, has spread quickly worldwide. Convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from patients following recovery from COVID-19 infection and development of antibodies against the virus is an attractive option for either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment, since antibodies may have direct or indirect antiviral activities and immunotherapy has proven effective in principle and in many clinical reports. OBJECTIVE: We seek to characterize the latest advances and evidence in the use of CP for COVID-19 through a systematic review and quantitative analysis, identify knowledge gaps in this setting, and offer recommendations and directives for future research. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were continuously searched for studies assessing the use of CP for COVID-19, including clinical studies, commentaries, reviews, guidelines or protocols, and in vitro testing of CP antibodies. The screening process and data extraction were performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality appraisal of all clinical studies was conducted using a universal tool independent of study designs. A meta-analysis of case-control and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Substantial literature has been published covering various aspects of CP therapy for COVID-19. Of the references included in this review, a total of 243 eligible studies including 64 clinical studies, 79 commentary articles, 46 reviews, 19 guidance and protocols, and 35 in vitro testing of CP antibodies matched the criteria. Positive results have been mostly observed so far when using CP for the treatment of COVID-19. There were remarkable heterogeneities in the CP therapy with respect to patient demographics, donor antibody titers, and time and dose of CP administration. The studies assessing the safety of CP treatment reported low incidence of adverse events. Most clinical studies, in particular case reports and case series, had poor quality. Only 1 RCT was of high quality. Randomized and nonrandomized data were found in 2 and 11 studies, respectively, and were included for meta-analysis, suggesting that CP could reduce mortality and increase viral clearance. Despite promising pilot studies, the benefits of CP treatment can only be clearly established through carefully designed RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: There is developing support for CP therapy, particularly for patients who are critically ill or mechanically ventilated and resistant to antivirals and supportive care. These studies provide important lessons that should inform the planning of well-designed RCTs to generate more robust knowledge for the efficacy of CP in patients with COVID-19. Future research is necessary to fill the knowledge gap regarding prevention and treatment for patients with COVID-19 with CP while other therapeutics are being developed.","output":"Convalescent Plasma for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Temporarily deferred donors are a forgotten pool of potential blood source.

The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production.

In Japan, the remarkable temperature increase in summer caused by an urban heat island and climate change has become a threat to public health in recent years. METHODS: This study aimed to determine the potential risk factors for heatstroke by analysing data extracted from the records of emergency transport to the hospital due to heatstroke in Fukuoka City, Japan. In this regard, a negative binomial regression model was used to account for overdispersion in the data. Age-structure analyses of heatstroke patients were also embodied to identify the sub-population of Fukuoka City with the highest susceptibility. RESULTS: The daily maximum temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), along with differences in both the mean temperature and time-weighted temperature from those of the consecutive past days were detected as significant risk factors for heatstroke. Results indicated that there was a positive association between the resulting risk factors and the probability of heatstroke occurrence. The elderly of Fukuoka City aged 70 years or older were found to be the most vulnerable to heatstroke. Most of the aforementioned risk factors also encountered significant and positive associations with the risk of heatstroke occurrence for the group with highest susceptibility.

Less is known about the intergenerational transmission of the trauma associated with OHC and psychosocial outcomes in mid-adulthood, particularly during a major health pandemic. DESIGN: To examine if there is evidence of intergenerational transmission of trauma associated with OHC in mid-adulthood, we used data from the 1970 British Cohort Study 2020 COVID-19 Survey. PARTICIPANTS: Cases were defined as cohort members (CMs) who had themselves experienced OHC (OHC1) and those whose mother reported to have been in OHC (OHC2). Among the 5320 CMs who participated in the second COVID-19 Survey, we have OHC information for n=4236. Our analytical samples range from n=2472 to 3864 depending on outcome: the largest sample comprised 105 (2.5%) CMs with direct OHC experience (OHC1), 93 (2.2%) CMs with a mother who had OHC experience (OHC2) and 3666 CMs with no OHC experience (OHC0). OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported outcomes at age 50 included indicators of depression, health and psychological well-being. Multivariate logistic regression models control for socioeconomic childhood background and current circumstances. RESULTS: Compared with the majority OHC0, the OHC1 group report higher levels of depression (OR 2.18 (95% CI 1.09 to 4.36) p<.05) and are at a greater risk of poor mental (OR 2.23 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.02) p<0.01) and general health (OR 3.32 (95% CI 1.65 to 6.67) p<0.001) during the pandemic. OHC2 was more than twice as likely to report poor mental health prepandemic (OR 2.52 (95% CI 1.37 to 4.64) p<0.01), but not during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Children of care leaver mothers (OHC2) appear to be better adjusted than those who were themselves in care (OHC1), although compared with those without care experience (OHC0) both groups had an increased risk of poorer adult outcomes.

This study established the highest H-index European pathogens. Commonalities amongst pathogens not included in previous surveillance or risk analyses were examined. Differences between host types (humans/animals/zoonotic) in pathogen H-indices were explored as a One Health impact indicator. Finally, the acceptability of the H-index proxy for animal pathogen impact was examined by comparison with other measures. 57 pathogens appeared solely in the top 100 highest H-indices (1) human or (2) animal pathogens list, and 43 occurred in both. Of human pathogens, 66 were zoonotic and 67 were emerging, compared to 67 and 57 for animals. There were statistically significant differences between H-indices for host types (humans, animal, zoonotic), and there was limited evidence that H-indices are a reasonable proxy for animal pathogen impact. This work addresses measures outlined by the European Commission to strengthen climate change resilience and biosecurity for infectious diseases. The results include a quantitative evaluation of infectious pathogen impact, and suggest greater impacts of human-only compared to zoonotic pathogens or scientific under-representation of zoonoses.

However, it is not clear whether individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a higher risk of COVID-19 or its adverse consequences. Recurrent respiratory viral infections are often associated with perturbation and pulmonary exacerbations of CF as evidenced by the significant morbidity observed in CF individuals during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The primary goal of this review was to systematically survey published accounts of COVID-19 in CF and determine if individuals with CF are disproportionally affected by SARS-CoV-2 and development of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search using EMBASE and Medline between April 28 and December 10, 2020. Six evaluable studies reporting on a total of 339 individuals with CF who developed COVID-19 were included in this study. RESULTS: We found that although individuals with CF generally experience acute exacerbations of lung disease from infectious agents, COVID-19 incidence estimates in CF appear to be lower than in the general population. However, there are reports of subsets of CF, such as those who had organ transplants, that may experience a more severe COVID-19 course. Potential protective mechanisms in the CF population include pre-pandemic social isolation practices, infection prevention and control knowledge, altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and the use of certain medications. CONCLUSIONS: Although individuals with CF are at risk of acute exacerbations often precipitated by respiratory tract viral infections, published evidence to date indicated that individuals with CF do not experience higher risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is evidence that some subsets within the CF population, including those post-transplantation, may experience a more severe clinical course.

Marked elevation of cytokines and chemokines is observed in these patients. Additional markers of inflammation, coagulation and organ damage such as CRP, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin, Troponin-I are also elevated. The hyperinflammatory condition leads to worsening of oxygen saturation due to pulmonary infiltration and exudation, organ damage and dysfunction of coagulation pathway which resembles disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and may lead to multi-organ failure.

However, it is unclear what study characteristics and behavior change techniques are potential mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to identify the behavior change techniques and study characteristics associated with effectiveness in behavioral interventions to reduce children's (0-18 years) screen time. METHODS A literature search of four databases (Ebscohost, Web of Science, EMBASE, and PubMed) was executed between January and February 2020 and updated during July 2021. Behavioral interventions targeting reductions in children's (0-18 years) screen time were included. Information on study characteristics (e.g., sample size, duration) and behavior change techniques (e.g., information, goal-setting) were extracted. Data on randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding was extracted and used to assess risk of bias. Meta-regressions were used to explore whether intervention effectiveness was associated with the presence of behavior change techniques and study characteristics. RESULTS The search identified 15,529 articles, of which 10,714 were screened for relevancy and 680 were retained for full-text screening. Of these, 204 studies provided quantitative data in the meta-analysis. The overall summary of random effects showed a small, beneficial impact of screen time interventions compared to controls (SDM = 0.116, 95CI 0.08 to 0.15). Inclusion of the Goals, Feedback, and Planning behavioral techniques were associated with a positive impact on intervention effectiveness (SDM = 0.145, 95CI 0.11 to 0.18).

At that time, the NATO Resolute Support mission involved nearly 17,000 troops from 38 partner nations, plus civilians who support the mission, scattered throughout Afghanistan. While Afghanistan did not initially report many confirmed cases, large numbers of cases were reported from neighboring countries with known migration across the borders (sometimes thousands/day). Military medical leaders advised commanders regarding the potential health risks to the force, balancing with risks to the mission. Quarantine and isolation protocols were established. Public health interventions of social distancing, cloth mask wear, enhanced environmental cleaning, active case finding, and emphasis on hand hygiene and cough etiquette were enforced. However, many base locations were unable to alleviate close living quarters. Testing was identified as a means to assess risk to the population. Testing capabilities were limited, particularly PCR. When this testing strategy was established, the utilization and interpretation of antibody tests was quite controversial. With rapid antibody kits, the time to detection of both IgM and IgG are similar; detection of either cannot identify the time since exposure. METHODS: A novel surveillance plan was established whereby subpopulations at highest risk for exposure to the virus were screened with antibody tests from 17 Apr-1 Jun, 2020. High risk populations included: those leaving quarantine, base defense guards, isolation unit guards, medical personnel, dining facility workers, and those who interact with local populations. Individuals with detectable antibody (either IgM or IgG) were further evaluated with PCR tests. RESULTS: In the first six weeks of this testing strategy, 1957 antibody tests were utilized. A total of 37 specimens were identified antibody positives with seroprevalence of 2% (Figure 1). Thirteen were identified to have positive IgG, 22 with IgM, and 2 with both. PCR was performed on those with detectable antibody, 13 (35%) had positive PCR. CONCLUSION: Serosurveillance of populations at high risk for exposure to the virus is a logical way to conserve testing resources in a constrained combat environment. DISCLOSURES: Alex M.

Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing behavioral interventions. PURPOSE: The current study applied an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior, and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning, habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior were taken 1 week later. RESULTS: Structural equation models indicated that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intentionCbehavior relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and behavior remained. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings highlight the importance of subjective norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants.

After debridement, the aim of surgical closure and reconstruction is to minimize disability and optimize appearance. Although skin grafting may fulfil this role, techniques higher on the reconstructive ladder, including local, regional and free flaps, are sometimes undertaken. This systematic review sought to determine the circumstances when this is true, which flaps were most commonly employed, and for which anatomical areas. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted utilising electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library). Full text studies of flaps used for the management of NSTI's (including Necrotising Fasciitis and Fournier Gangrene) were included. The web-based program 'Covidence' facilitated storage of references and data management. Data obtained in the search included reference details (journal, date and title), the study design, the purpose of the study, the study findings, number of patients with NSTI included, the anatomical areas of NSTI involved, the types of flaps used, and the complication rate. RESULTS After screening 4555 references, 501 full text manuscripts were assessed for eligibility after duplicates and irrelevant studies were excluded. 230 full text manuscripts discussed the use of 888 flap closures in the context of NSTI in 733 patients; the majority of these were case series published in the last 20 years in a large variety of journals. Reconstruction of the perineum following Fournier's gangrene accounted for the majority of the reported flaps (58.6%). Free flaps were used infrequently (8%), whereas loco-regional muscle flaps (18%) and loco-regional fasciocutaneous flaps (71%) were employed more often. The reported rate of partial or complete flap loss was 3.3%. CONCLUSION Complex skin and soft tissue defects from NSTIs, not amenable to skin grafting, can be more effectively and durably covered using a spectrum of flaps. This systematic review highlights the important contribution that the plastic surgeon makes as an integral member of multidisciplinary teams managing these patients.","output":"Flap coverage for necrotising soft tissue infections: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some maternal characteristics indicate worse prognosis in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In depressive disorders a chronic low-grade inflammatory process is observed, with higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) values. Furthermore, in SARS-CoV2 infection, which is closely related to depressive disorders, there is a proinflammatory cascade of cytokines that causes systemic inflammation. METHODS: The present study evaluates the relationship between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels and the presence of depressive and adjustment disorders in a sample of 1851 patients admitted to hospital for SARS-CoV2 infection from March to November 2020. Concentrations of IL-6 and CRP were determined within the first 72 ?h at admission and compared among groups of patients according to previous history and current presence of depression or adjustment disorders. RESULTS: IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in the group of patients with depression and adjustment disorders compared to patients without such disorders (114.25 ?pg/mL (SD, 225.44) vs. 86.41 (SD, 202.97)), even after adjusting for several confounders.

Therefore, we investigated how the pandemic affected the lives of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD), compared pre- and peri-pandemic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and a patient-reported experience measure (PREM), and investigated whether having had COVID-19 impacted pre-/peri-pandemic differences of the PROMs and PREM. METHODS AND RESULTS: As part of the ongoing APPROACH-IS II project, we longitudinally surveyed 716 adults with CHD from Belgium, Norway, and South Korea. Pre-pandemic measures were administered from August 2019 to February 2020 and the peri-pandemic surveys were completed September 2020CApril 2021. The majority of patients indicated that their social lives (80%), mental health (58%), and professional lives/education (51%) were negatively impacted by the pandemic. Patients felt worried (65%), were afraid (55%), reported the pandemic felt close to them (53%), and were stressed (52%).

Adipose tissue is generally linked to excessive body fat, and it is well known that the female breast is rich in adipose tissue. Hence, one can wonder: what is the role of adipose tissue in the breast and why is it required? Adipose tissue as an organ consists of adipocytes, an extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells, with a significant role in the dynamics of breast changes throughout the life span of a female breast from puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution. In this review, we will discuss the importance of breast adipose tissue in breast development and its involvement in breast changes happening during pregnancy, lactation and involution. We will focus on understanding the biology of breast adipose tissue, with an overview on its involvement in the various steps of breast cancer development and progression. The interaction between the breast adipose tissue surrounding cancer cells and vice-versa modifies the tumor microenvironment in favor of cancer. Understanding this mutual interaction and the role of breast adipose tissue in the tumor microenvironment could potentially raise the possibility of overcoming breast adipose tissue mediated resistance to therapies and finding novel candidates to target breast cancer.","output":"The Importance of Breast Adipose Tissue in Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National Health Service employers are subject to legal duties to protect the health and safety of their employees and third parties who come into contact with their staff.

Multi-organ dysfunctions including neurological sequelae during COVID-19 persist even after declining viral load. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 gene product, Spike, is able to modify the host exosomal cargo, which gets transported to distant uninfected tissues and organs and can initiate a catastrophic immune cascade within Central Nervous System (CNS). SARS-CoV-2 Spike transfected cells release a significant amount of exosomes loaded with microRNAs such as miR-148a and miR-590. microRNAs gets internalized by human microglia and suppress target gene expression of USP33 (Ubiquitin Specific peptidase 33) and downstream IRF9 levels. Cellular levels of USP33 regulate the turnover time of IRF9 via deubiquitylation. Our results also demonstrate that absorption of modified exosomes effectively regulate the major pro-inflammatory gene expression profile of TNF, NF-B and IFN-. These results uncover a bystander pathway of SARS-CoV-2 mediated CNS damage through hyperactivation of human microglia. Our results also attempt to explain the extra-pulmonary dysfunctions observed in COVID-19 cases when active replication of virus is not supported. Since Spike gene and mRNAs have been extensively picked up for vaccine development; the knowledge of host immune response against spike gene and protein holds a great significance. Our study therefore provides novel and relevant insights regarding the impact of Spike gene on shuttling of host microRNAs via exosomes to trigger the neuroinflammation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Targets USP33-IRF9 Axis via Exosomal miR-148a to Activate Human Microglia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has necessitated the identification of sequence areas in the viral proteome that are capable to serve as antigenic sites and treatment targets. In the present study, we have applied a novel approach for mechanistically illuminating the virus-host organism interactions, by analyzing the Unique Peptides (UPs) of the virus featured by a minimum amino acid sequence length being defined as Core Unique Peptides (CrUPs), not of the virus per se, but against the entire proteome of the host organism. This approach resulted in the identification of CrUPs of the virus itself, which could not be recognized in the host organism proteome. Thereby, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for identification of CrUPs against the human proteome, which have been defined as C/H-CrUPs. We herein reveal that SARS-CoV-2 include 7.503 C/H-CrUPs, with the SPIKE_SARS2 being detected as the protein with the highest density of C/H-CrUPs. Extensive analysis has indicated that the critical P681R mutation produces new C/H-CrUPs around the R685 cleavage site, while the L452R mutation causes loss of antigenicity of the NF9 peptide and strong(er) binding of the virus to its ACE2 receptor protein. Simultaneous formation of these mutations in detrimental variants like Delta leads to the immune escape of the virus, its massive entrance into the host cell, a notable increase in virus formation, and its massive release and thus elevated infectivity of human target cells.","output":"Unique peptide signatures of SARS-CV-2 virus against human proteome reveal variants immune escape and infectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In recent years, therapy-refractory courses of dermatophytoses have increasingly become the focus of attention. The most frequent pathogens are Trichophyton (T.) rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. In addition to local therapy, first-line treatment includes terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal agent that acts by inhibiting squalene epoxidase and thus interfering with ergosterol synthesis. In refractory cases, terbinafine resistance due to point mutation in the squalene epoxidase gene has been frequently detected. OBJECTIVES The aim is to present specific aspects in the epidemiology of dermatophytoses with terbinafine resistance and to illustrate them on the basis of four patient cases including diagnostic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS A review of handbook knowledge, a selective literature search, and a review of four patient cases were performed. RESULTS Detection of the terbinafine resistance was performed by in vitro testing using the breakpoint method as well as sequencing of the Trichophyton isolate and detection of the point mutation with amino acid substitution at position L393F or F397L of squalene epoxidase. CONCLUSION In refractory and recurrent dermatophytoses, terbinafine resistance should be considered, especially in T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum, and in vitro resistance testing of the dermatophyte and point mutation analysis of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) should be performed. Therapeutically, intermittent administration of itraconazole in combination with antifungal local therapy is recommended. Nevertheless, a recurrent course is to be expected and long-term therapy with itraconazole is usually necessary.","output":"[Terbinafine-resistant dermatophytoses and onychomycosis due to Trichophyton rubrum]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic may increase risk of intimate partner and sexual violence and make relevant services less accessible. This study explored the perspectives of intimate partner and sexual violence workers across Canada on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the survivors with whom they work. METHODS: Using a qualitative descriptive design, we interviewed 17 management and frontline staff of organizations supporting survivors of intimate partner and sexual violence across Canada. Results: We identified 4 themes that describe the impacts of COVID-19 on intimate partner and sexual violence survivors, from the perspective of service providers: (1) No escape; (2) Isolation; (3) Tough decisions; and (4) Heightened vulnerability. These narrative findings are presented first, followed by an analysis within a social determinants of health framework. Interpreting our findings against such a framework revealed a complex interplay of social determinants, notably social support, access to services, and poverty, that produced several challenges for intimate partner and sexual violence survivors during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: According to service providers, intimate partner and sexual violence survivors in Canada faced several challenges during the pandemic, including reduced ability to escape their situations, increased isolation, increasingly complex decisions, and heightened vulnerability. Our findings demonstrate the critical need to adopt a broader, more holistic approach in tackling intimate partner and sexual violence by also addressing socioeconomic issues such as poverty and marginalization.

This paper examines, (i) the reporting of a worsening state of illness as a result of COVID-19-related measures among individuals with depressive disorders; and (ii) whether this worsening was related to restrictions in healthcare for depression or changes in depression-related lifestyle. The analysis was based on a population-representative survey of the German population aged 18C69 years (N = 5,135 respondents, comprising a subgroup of n = 1,038 persons suffering from depression and n = 598 persons who spent the lockdown primarily in home isolation). The key findings were: 49% (n = 505) of respondents with self-reported diagnosed depression reported that the measures against the pandemic had a negative impact on their depressive illness (new depressive episode, worsening of symptoms, suicidal impulses, suicide attempt, and other negative consequences). Of those who reported impaired access to healthcare for their depressive illness, 70% (n = 276) also reported a worsening of their depressive illness. This was a significantly higher percentage than those who did not experience impaired access to healthcare (36%, n = 229, p < 0.001). Of those who reported changes in depression-related lifestyle (loss of daily structure, lack of exercise, or extended bed and sleep time), 58% (n = 308) reported a worsening of their depressive illness. This was a significantly higher percentage than those who did not exhibit any of the outlined behaviours (28%, n = 19, p < 0.001). Worsening of the depressive illness was most common among those who reported a lack of daily structure or extended bedtimes (67%; n = 230 resp. N = 226). People who mentioned a lack of exercise also reported a worsening of their depressive illness (59%; n = 271). These findings reinforce the need to consider the suffering and possible increased suicide risk to people suffering from depression induced by measures designed to constrain the COVID-19 pandemic; an important consideration in identifying the optimal risk-benefit ratio when setting pandemic measures. Our study highlighted the importance of maintaining healthcare, even in crisis situations, and ensuring access to guideline-based treatment for people who need urgent care. It also showed that political interventions can influence individual behaviours that can have negative effects on depressive illness.","output":"Lockdown Measures Against the Spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Negative Effects for People Living With Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India, the second-most populous country in the world and the third-largest consumer of primary energy, faces the challenge of meeting the twin objectives of fulfilling the aspirations of its citizens by providing them a reasonable standard of living while at the same time to protect its environment and meet climate change objectives.

The purpose of this study was to create metrics for and evaluate the validity for two new tasks: camera navigation (N) and cannulation (C), and to explore the potential value of adding these tasks to the FLS program. METHODS Participants were assessed by two raters during performance of N and C in addition to the five standard FLS tasks. They also completed a questionnaire regarding the educational value of the new tasks. Validity evidence was assessed by comparing performance between Novice (PGY 1 and 2) and Experienced (PGY 3 and higher) participants, and by correlating new task scores with standard FLS scores. The ability to predict level of training using scores was evaluated by regression analysis. RESULTS Sixty subjects participated from five North American centers.

We present a patient with an eroded IPP who developed a secondary contralateral urethrocavernous fistula requiring repeat urethroplasty. We also describe the literature surrounding these complications and strategies to prevent them. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presented to our clinic with 6 months of intermittent white urethral discharge first noted after IPP removal and replacement by an outside urologist for device malfunction. Office cystoscopy revealed an eroded right-sided prosthetic cylinder in the bulbar urethra. The patient was taken to the operating room for IPP explantation with closure of right corporal defect, left sided malleable prosthesis placement, and primary excision with anastomosis of his bulbar urethra. A catheter was left in place for two weeks postoperatively, at which time a peri-catheter retrograde urethrogram was performed which showed no evidence of contrast extravasation and his catheter was subsequently removed. Several months later, he presented with recurrent urethral discharge without evidence of recurrent erosion on cystoscopy with development of scrotal abscesses following office cystoscopy, concerning for an unidentified urethral defect. He returned to the operating room for scrotal exploration and was noted on cystoscopy to have a pinpoint fistula between his left corporal body and his bulbar urethra. He underwent left sided malleable prosthetic explant, and non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty. Peri-catheter retrograde urethrogram two weeks later showed no contrast extravasation and he has had no recurrence of urethral discharge or scrotal abscesses since.

Many countries worldwide implemented stringent social isolation as a strategy to contain virus transmission. However, the same physical distancing that protects against the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact mental health and well-being of the population. The present study sought to shed light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and subjective well-being (SWB) among individuals who were subjected to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in Brazil between March 31 and April 2, 2020. All of the volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement after reading consent terms. The inclusion criteria were participants who had been in social isolation for at least 1 week and agreed to the consent terms. Three instruments were applied. A questionnaire was constructed for this study that assessed the participants exercise routines. The Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being, and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) scale was created by researchers of this study that assessed the relationship between well-being and physical activity during social isolation. The Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was also used. A total of 592 participants (371 female, 220 male, 1 transgender), 14C74 years old (M = 32.39 years, SD = 10.5 years), reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 days (SD = 3.3 days). Well-being that was related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine was linked to an established routine of physical activity before the social isolation period. Participants who already practiced physical exercises previously and reported continuing the practice during the quarantine period had higher positive affect scores. Participants who engaged in physical activity without direct guidance only during the quarantine period had higher negative affect scores. Participants who already practiced physical activity felt more motivated to continue practicing physical activity during the social isolation period, resulting in positive affect, unlike participants who began exercising only during quarantine. Our results suggest that negative affect can occur among individuals who only just begin exercising during social isolation, indicating that physical activity should be habitual and not only occur during periods of social isolation. Engaging in exercise only during social isolation may contribute to an increase in malaise.","output":"Effects of physical activity and exercise on well-being in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays and due to the pandemic of COVID-19, nurses are working under the highest pressure benevolently all over the world. This urgent situation can cause more fatigue for nurses who are responsible for taking care of COVID-19 patients 24 hours a day. Therefore, nurse scheduling should be modified with respect to this new situation. The purpose of the present research is to propose a new mathematical model for Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) considering the fatigue factor. To solve the proposed model, a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been developed to provide a nurse schedule for all three shifts of a day. To validate the proposed approach, a randomly generated problem has been solved. In addition, to show the applicability of the proposed approach in real situations, the model has been solved for a real case study, a department in one of the hospitals in Esfahan, Iran, where COVID-19 patients are hospitalized. Consequently, a nurse schedule for May has been provided applying the proposed model, and the results approve its superiority in comparison with the manual schedule that is currently used in the department.

A positive transformation has been brought about by innovative solutions in the health care sector that aim to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on human health. For instance, the use of telehealth has been on the rise amidst this public health emergency. OBJECTIVE: Given the unprecedented scale of the pandemic with no definitive endpoint, we aimed to scope the existing telehealth-related literature during a defined period of the ongoing pandemic (ie, January to June 2020). METHODS: Our scoping review was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer Manual. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases with specific eligibility criteria. Data extracted from the shortlisted articles included first author and affiliation, journal title, publication type, terminologies used to describe telehealth and their accompanying definitions, health discipline or medical specialties and subspecialties wherein telehealth had been applied, the purpose of telehealth use, and the authors' overall sentiment on telehealth use. We collated the available information and used descriptive statistics to analyze the synthesized data. RESULTS: In all, 543 articles published across 331 different journals were included in this scoping review. The Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals featured the highest number of articles (25/543, 4.6%). Nearly all (533/543, 98.2%) articles were in English. The majority of the articles were opinions, commentaries, and perspectives (333/543, 61.3%). Most authors of the articles reviewed were from high-income countries (470/543, 86.6%), especially from the United States of America (237/543, 43.6%). In all, 39 different definitions were used to describe terms equivalent to telehealth. A small percentage (42/543, 7.7%) of the articles focused on the provision of COVID-19-related care. Moreover, 49.7% (270/543) of the articles primarily focused on the provision of multiple components of clinical care, and 23% (125/543) of the articles focused on various specialties and subspecialties of internal medicine. For a vast majority (461/543, 84.9%) of the articles, the authors expressed a celebratory sentiment about the use of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified considerable emerging literature on telehealth during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit mostly from high-income countries. There is compelling evidence to suggest that telehealth may have a significant effect on advancing health care in the future. However, the feasibility and application of telehealth in resource-limited settings and low- and middle-income countries must be established to avail its potential and transform health care for the world's population. Given the rapidity with which telehealth is advancing, a global consensus on definitions, boundaries, protocols, monitoring, evaluation, and data privacy is urgently needed.","output":"Use of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Misinformation has become a frightening specter of society, especially fake news that concerning Covid-19.

Abstract SARS-CoV2 infection, also known as COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease-19), was first identified in December 2019. In Spain, the first case of this infection was diagnosed on 31 January, 2020 and, by 30 March 2020, has caused 7340 deaths, especially in the elderly. Due to the rapidly evolving situation regarding this disease, the data reported in this article may be subject to modifications. The older population are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and to developing severe disease. The higher morbidity and mortality rates in older people have been associated with comorbidity, especially cardiovascular disease, and frailty, which weakens the immune response. Due to both the number of affected countries and the number of cases, the current situation constitutes an ongoing pandemic and a major health emergency. Because Spain has one of the largest older populations in the world, COVID-19 has emerged as a geriatric emergency.

Further analysis of the textual data identified two nuanced trends: universities in a more economically developed region and at a higher level tended to have more rigid and exclusive recruitment preferences for candidates with an overseas background; competitive employers tended to be selective in applicants overseas backgrounds by gauging their potential productivity measured in quantifiable research outputs.

Wild boar is a main driver of the transmission and persistence of ASFV in the endemic infected countries in Europe. Some European countries free from ASF, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have limited population sizes of wild boar, but have large swine productions. In these countries, the patterns of transmission and persistence of ASFV in the existing wild boar population, in case of introduction of ASFV, are unknown. It is important to get a better understanding of ASFV in these wild boar populations, in order to better manage the existing wild boar population and thereby minimize the risk of virus introduction and transmission to domestic pigs, in case of an ASFV incursion. We created an agent-based spatio-temporal model and simulated the transmission of ASFV within Danish wild boar populations, using actual landscape data. The model was run with 50 and 100 wild boar groups used as initial population sizes, respectively, either distributed across the southern part of the mainland (Jutland) or across both the southern and middle parts of Jutland, where wild boar groups are believed to exist. At first, the model was run without ASFV for 25 years to assess wild boar population dynamics in both regions. Thereafter, ASFV was added to the model 1 year after initiation and run for up to another 4 years. The model predicted that wild boar populations may increase drastically over the next 25 years, if wild boar groups were distributed across both southern and middle Jutland and no mitigation actions were taken, while the population sizes will be restricted, if groups were distributed only across the southern part of Jutland. The density of the population is an important factor affecting the transmission and persistency of the disease. Model results indicated that ASF epidemics in the simulated populations would generally persist for few months. However, due to the high stochasticity of the process, in certain situations the epidemics may last for more than one year, posing a serious risk of ASFV introduction to domestic pigs.","output":"Simulation of transmission and persistence of African swine fever in wild boar in Denmark."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 49 pneumonia because of its availability and rapidity.

Our aim was to describe the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) and investigate the association between pathogens and (i) exacerbation severity on presentation and (ii) ED treatment failure. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the DOORWAY study, a prospective multi-center cohort of children (1C17 years) presenting to the ED with moderate or severe asthma exacerbation. All received per protocol oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Nasopharyngeal (NPA) secretions were analyzed by RT-PCR for 30 different pathogens. Linear and logistic multivariate regression models were used to estimate absolute risks and risk differences (RD) with their 95% CI representing average marginal effects. RESULTS: Of 958 patients with NPA specimens, 591 (61.7%) were positive for  1 pathogens; human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most prevalent (29.4%). Non-HRV infection (RD -12.9%; 95% CI -19.5; -6.3), human metapneumovirus (RD -13.6%; 95% CI -23.0%; -4.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (RD -31.7%; 95% CI -44.5%; -18.9%) were negatively associated with severity; no association was found between severity and the presence of any pathogen, co-infection, or the specific viruses HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza (INF), enterovirus serotype D68, adenovirus or coronavirus. The risk of treatment failure in the absence of a pathogen was 12.5% (95% CI 9.0%; 16.0%). The presence of any pathogen (RD 8.2%; 95% CI 3.3%; 13.1%) and non-HRV infection as a group (RD 13.1%; 95% CI 6.4%; 19.8%), and of INF and PIV specifically (RD 24.9%; 95% CI 4.7%; 45.1% and RD 34.1%; 95% CI 7.5%; 60.7%) were positively associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of children with moderate or severe exacerbation, no single respiratory pathogen was associated with higher severity on presentation. However, in addition to any pathogen and non-HVR infection, INF and PIV were specifically associated with higher treatment failure in the ED, supporting the need for influenza prevention, pathogen identification at presentation and exploration of pathogen-therapy interaction.

Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was performed before and 45 days after surgery. RESULTS In both strains of rats, there was no statistical difference in food intake and weight gain between the sham and SG rodents before and after surgery. In ZF rats, there was no change in fasting glucose or OGTT area under the curve (AUC) before or 45 days after surgery. In the ZDF rodents, the mean preoperative fasting glucose and OGTT AUC was 204  25 and 25,441  2,648, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate on how people perceive the COVID-19 outbreak using the components of the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) and to find out how this might contribute to possible behavioral responses to the prevention and control of the disease. Methods: : This cross-sectional study was conducted in Iran during March and April 2020. Participants were recruited via online applications using a number of platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Instagram asking people to take part in the study. To collect data an electronic self-designed questionnaire based on the EPPM was used in order to measure the risk perception (efficacy, defensive responses, perceived treat) related to the COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were used to explore the data. Results: : A total of 3,727 individuals with a mean age (SD) of 37.0 (11.1) years participated in the study. The results revealed significant differences in efficacy, defensive responses and perceived treat among different population groups particularly among those aged 60 and over. Women had significantly higher scores than men on some aspects such as self-efficacy, reactance, and avoidance but men had higher perceived susceptibility scores compared to women. Overall 56.4% of participants were engaged in danger control (preventive behavior) while the remaining 43.6% were engaged in fear control (non-preventive behavior) process. Conclusion: More than half of all participants motivated by danger control. This indicated that more than half of participants had high perceived efficacy (i.e., self-efficacy and response efficacy). Self-efficacy scores were significantly higher among participants who were older, female, single, lived in rural areas, and had good economic status.

DESIGN: A Finite Mixture Model (FMM) is used to uncover a mix of two latent groups of hospitals that differ in quality. In the FMM, a multinomial logistic equation relates hospital-level factors to the odds of being in either group. A multiple linear regression relates the characteristics of communities served by hospitals to the patients' expected ratings of their experiences at hospitals in each group. Thus, this association potentially varies with hospital quality. The analysis was conducted via Stata. SETTING: Hospital ratings are measured by Hospital Compare using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, a patient satisfaction survey required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for hospitals in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 2,816 Medicare-certified acute care hospitals across all US states. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in the marginal impacts of key community demographics on patient experiences between the two groups of hospitals. RESULTS: We provide evidence that low-rated hospitals have much more variability in patient experience ratings than high-rated ones. Moreover, the experiences at low-rated hospitals are more sensitive to county demographic factors, which means exogenous shocks, like coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), will likely affect these hospitals differently, as such shocks are known to disproportionately affect their communities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that low-rated hospitals with more variability in their HCAHPS responses are more likely to face adverse patient experiences due to COVID-19 than high-rated hospitals.

To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH.

All the researchers had found significant reduction in number of tests (depending on pool size, stages, and pooling design), leading to conservation of resources. Pooling can be done with extracted RNA eluate or directly with patient's sample before extraction. This leads to further reduction in consumables, time and manpower. Risk of false negativity in samples with high-threshold cycle (i.e., low-viral load) value was a concern. Some researchers suggest adding few additional cycles to lower the chances of missing positive cases with low-Ct value. Lower limit of detection (LoD) of RT-PCR kits, that is, sensitivity of kits was another factor to consider. Thus, in a country like India, given the economic benefit and scarcity of resources, pooling strategy can be very effective, especially in low-prevalence areas and in low-risk contacts.","output":"Effectiveness of Sample Pooling Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Mass Screening by RT-PCR: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is posing major challenges to the health care sector. This scoping review compiles evidence concerning changes to health care service availability and utilisation as well as possible impacts on health for selected groups of chronically ill people in Germany. The focus is on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and mental disorders. Most empirical data available concerned inpatient care and showed a clear decline in the utilisation of inpatient treatments in March and April 2020 in the areas of oncology and cardiology as well as in mental health. For cardiovascular emergencies such as heart attack and stroke, a decline was observed especially regarding less serious cases. Although there were indications of treatment delays, there was no evidence thus far that emergency care had been generally compromised due to adjustments to inpatient care capacities. In the outpatient setting, extensive adjustments to health care services availability were observed for all disease groups considered. Overall, very limited empirical data were available. In particular, hardly any data were available on how changes in care impacted population health.

We evaluated several unsupervised gene embedding models leveraging literature-curated signed causal gene expression findings. Using linear regression, it is shown that, based on these gene embeddings, gene-function relationships can be predicted with about 95% precision for the highest scoring genes. Function embedding vectors, derived from parameters of the linear regression model, allow to infer relationships between different functions or diseases. We show for several diseases that gene and function embeddings can be used to recover key drivers of pathogenesis, as well as underlying cellular and physiological processes. These results are presented as disease-centric networks of genes and functions.

METHODS: This retrospective study used data from the longitudinal prescription (LRx) database (IQVIA) and included all patients with at least two insulin prescriptions per year in 2017-2021. Calculated daily dose (CDD) was assessed in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, separately. RESULTS: The number of patients was comprised between 1,120,276 in 2017 and 1,079,894 in 2021. Median (interquartile range) CDD of basal insulin was relatively stable across the years and ranged between 27.9 (18.5-38.8) in 2021 and 28.3 (18.7-39.5) in 2020. In terms of short-acting insulin, median (interquartile range) CDD slightly decreased from 40.1 (28.2-54.3) in 2017 to 38.1 (27.2-52.2) in 2021. A slight decrease was also observed for mix insulin, from 39.4 (27.5-55.3) in 2017 to 37.9 (26.5-54.2) in 2021. These results were corroborated in most age and sex subgroups.

With delays in the 2021 Electronic Residency Applications Service (ERAS) timeline, students and programs have had more time to interact prior to the formal application process. This communication will report recent trends in social media presence by OHNS residency programs, and discuss mechanisms to compensate for decreased applicant-program interactions using social media ahead of the 2021 Match. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of the accredited otolaryngology residency programs in the United States, the number of social media profiles on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook from 2009 to 2019 were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Most programs (61%) have at least 1 social media profile. Over the past 10 years, the number of programs on social media has increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter and Instagram showed higher rates of growth compared to Facebook. With the reduction of in-person opportunities for interactions, both applicants and programs are utilizing social media to showcase their values and their research. Twitter, in particular, also serves as a platform for professional networking. CONCLUSION: Both Twitter and Instagram are growing in popularity among programs and applicants to enhance networking.

Polysomnography (PSG) type I, the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA, is expensive and difficult to access by low-income populations. In this study, we aimed to verify the accuracy of the oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI) in comparison to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) using a portable monitor. METHODS: We evaluated 94 type III PSG home test results of 65 elderly patients (69.216.94 years old), along with information, such as the body mass index (BMI) and sex, using data obtained from a clinical trial database. RESULTS: A significant linear positive correlation (r=0.93, p<0.05) was observed between ODI and AHI, without any interference from sex, BMI, and positional component. The sensitivity of ODI compared to that of AHI increased with an increase in the severity of OSA, while the specificity of ODI in comparison to that of AHI was high for all degrees of severity. The accuracy of ODI was 80.7% for distinguishing between patients with mild and moderate apnea and 84.4% for distinguishing between patients with moderate and severe apnea. CONCLUSION: The ODI values obtained in uncontrolled conditions exhibited high sensitivity for identifying severe apnea compared to the AHI values, and correctly identified the severity of OSA in more than 80% of the cases.

Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc.

The relationship between cough and the severity of asthma is ill defined. A study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that, in children with asthma who cough as a major part of their asthma symptoms, cough receptor sensitivity (CRS) is heightened during an acute severe exacerbation of asthma but not in the non-acute phase and airway calibre or its change correlates with CRS. METHODS Spirometric measurements and the capsaicin CRS test were performed on children admitted to hospital for an acute severe exacerbation of asthma. Nasal secretions were tested for viruses. The children were grouped into those who usually cough with asthma episodes and those who do not. The tests were repeated 7-10 days and 4-6 weeks later. The CRS outcome measure used was the concentration of capsaicin required to stimulate two (Cth) and five coughs (C5). RESULTS The CRS of the group who coughed (n = 15) was significantly higher than those who did not cough (n = 16) (mean difference log Cth 0.77 mumol (95% CI 0.35 to 1.18), C5 0.72 mumol (95% CI 0.26 to 1.18)) during acute asthma but not after the exacerbation. CRS was not significantly different between groups based on the presence of a viral infection. Neither forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) nor its change correlated with CRS nor its change.

Their resilience is defined as the ability to withstand and maintain a certain level of functionality of performances compared to their reference regular/planned level during the impact of disruptive events and to recover reasonably rapidly afterwards. Robustness is defined as the level of saved functionality of performances compared to their planned/regular level, enabling continuous operations during the impact of disruptive events. The level of deteriorated functionality compared to that of the planned/regular functionality of performances represents their vulnerability. This paper develops a methodology for assessing resilience, robustness and vulnerability of airports affected by a given disruptive event(s). The methodology consists of analytical models of indicators of operational, economic, social and environmental performances of airports and other main actors/stakeholders involved. These indicators are used as figures-of-merit in analytical models for assessing their cumulative and time-dependent resilience, robustness, and vulnerability. The methodology is applied to assess resilience, robustness and vulnerability of two large airports - LHR (London Heathrow, UK) and NYC JFK (John F.

Based on the indicators of operational and economic performances, the results indicate very low resilience and robustness and very high vulnerability of both airports and their other main actors/stakeholders involved. Their resilience and robustness based on the indicators of social and environmental performances were not substantively different from the corresponding vulnerability. In absolute terms, LHR airport has been affected stronger than its NYC JFK counterpart.

Responses often come through reallocation of resources from one disease control effort to a new pressing need. The operating models of preparedness and response are ill-equipped to prevent or ameliorate disease emergence or reemergence at global scales. Epidemiological challenges that are a threat to the economic stability of many regions of the world, particularly those depending on travel and trade, remain at the forefront of the Global Commons. Consequently, efforts to quantify the impact of mobility and trade on disease dynamics have dominated the interests of theoreticians for some time. Our experience includes an H1N1 influenza pandemic crisscrossing the world during 2009 and 2010, the 2014 Ebola outbreaks, limited to regions of West Africa lacking appropriate medical facilities, health infrastructure, and sufficient levels of preparedness and education, and the expanding Zika outbreaks, moving expeditiously across habitats suitable for Aedes aegypti. These provide opportunities to quantify the impact of disease emergence or reemergence on the decisions that individuals take in response to real or perceived disease risks. The case of SARS 2003 in 2003, the efforts to reduce the burden of H1N1 influenza cases in 2009, and the challenges faced in reducing the number of Ebola cases in 2014 are the three recent scenarios that required a timely global response. Studies addressing the impact of centralized sources of information, the impact of information along social connections, or the role of past disease outbreak experiences on the risk-aversion decisions that individuals undertake may help identify and quantify the role of human responses to disease dynamics while recognizing the importance of assessing the timing of disease emergence and reemergence. The co-evolving human responses to disease dynamics are prototypical of the feedbacks that define complex adaptive systems.

We aimed to provide an overall view of patients perspectives, concerns, and expectations towards their treatment throughout the clinic lockdown during the pandemic; and to assess patients levels of mental distress and its association with their confidence in resuming care. METHODS: An anonymous, validated, in-person paper questionnaire was distributed to adult orthodontic patients post-lockdown at an academic institution. The survey focused on the clinical aspects and patients perspectives regarding orthodontic treatment during the pandemic. The Kessler Mental Distress Scale (K10) was used to evaluate their psychological status. Survey responses were descriptively summarized and confidence in resuming care was compared between normal patients and patients with mental distress using Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients were surveyed from July to October 2020. Mean age of the participants was 29.30 (SD = 12.01) years and 62% were females. Emergencies during the closure (21%, 32/154) involved primarily irritation with protruding wires. Patients were neutral regarding tele-dentistry and preferred their current fixed appliances over clear aligners. Upon resuming care, 80.51% were extremely pleased with the restrictive protocols and with high level of confidence in resuming treatment. The average level of anxiety was low, and a modest association was found between mental distress and reduced confidence in resuming treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Few numbers of minor emergencies occurred during the clinic closure. Despite the rising interest in tele-dentistry, patients were neutral on considering this option to monitor treatment and were content with fixed appliances. Patients had high confidence levels to resume their care based on the protocols established upon reopening. The association of mental distress and confidence in resuming care is suggestive and needs further investigation.","output":"Patients perceptions of orthodontic treatment experiences during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mixed valence Cs?{Fe4-Fe4} cyanido-cube was synthesized and structurally characterized.

Here, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, we delineated metabolic remodeling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that may lead to the progression of severe COVID-19. After scoring the metabolism-related biological processes and signaling pathways, we found that mono-CD14+ cells expressed higher levels of glycolysis-related genes (PKM, LDHA and PKM) and PPP-related genes (PGD and TKT) in severe patients than in mild patients. These genes may contribute to the hyperinflammation in mono-CD14+ cells of patients with severe COVID-19. The mono-CD16+ cell population in COVID-19 patients showed reduced transcription levels of genes related to lysine degradation (NSD1, KMT2E, and SETD2) and elevated transcription levels of genes involved in OXPHOS (ATP6V1B2, ATP5A1, ATP5E, and ATP5B), which may inhibit M2-like polarization. Plasma cells also expressed higher levels of the OXPHOS gene ATP13A3 in COVID-19 patients, which was positively associated with antibody secretion and survival of PCs. Moreover, enhanced glycolysis or OXPHOS was positively associated with the differentiation of memory B cells into plasmablasts or plasma cells. This study comprehensively investigated the metabolic features of peripheral immune cells and revealed that metabolic changes exacerbated inflammation in monocytes and promoted antibody secretion and cell survival in PCs in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease.","output":"Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of the Immunometabolic Rewiring and Immunopathogenesis of Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has infected tens of millions of people worldwide since its pandemic.

However, the clinical efficacy and safety of CPT in COVID-19 remains unclear.Methods: We performed a matched control study by PSM analysis (including 163 cases with CPT and 163 controls with the standard treatment) and meta-analysis (including 498 cases and 557 controls) estimate the clinical efficacy and security of CPT and COVID-19, which will help inform clinical management of COVID-19 infection.Results: We found that days of hospital stay in case with CPT groups were significantly higher than matched control group (P< 0.0001). A significant reduction in mortality (OR= 0.496, 95%CI= 0.342-0.719, P< 0.0001) was found in the CPT group compared with the standard treatment group, and a true positive result was also found in sequential analysis. In terms of adverse events, sequential analysis found a false positive, although meta-analysis found a significant increase in the incidence of adverse events in patients treated with CPT compared to the control group. No differences between the two groups in terms of length of stay, improvement of clinical symptoms, and discharge were found.Conclusions: This study is the first to systematically review and meta-analysis the efficacy and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 in the largest sample size. Our results showed that CPT could significantly reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients, and there was no significant increase in the incidence of adverse events.

Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001).

The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality.

The content and bioavailabilities of proteinogenic AAs in beef are greater than those in plant-sourced foods. Taurine (a potent anti-oxidant) is essential for the integrity and functions of tissues, including eyes, heart, and skeletal muscle, whereas -alanine is required for the production of antioxidative and neuromodulatory dipeptides. Furthermore, beef contains a large amount of creatine (essential for energy metabolism in tissues, particularly brain and skeletal muscle), anti-oxidative dipeptides (carnosine and anserine), and 4-hydroxyproline (an anti-inflammatory nutrient that maintains intestinal integrity and inhibits colitis). There are myths that plants provide all nutrients that are available in animal-sourced foods. However, taurine, vitamin B(12), creatine, carnosine, and anserine are absent from plants, whereas -alanine and 4-hydroxyproline are low or negligible in plants. Like other animal-sourced foods, beef plays an important role in the optimum growth of children and the prevention of anemia in humans, as well as maintaining muscle mass, delaying ageing, and mitigating sarcopenia in adults, while meeting the high demands of exercising individuals for high-quality protein. Some epidemiological studies raised concern that the consumption of red meat might increase risks for chronic diseases in humans, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancers. However, findings from many epidemiological and clinical studies do not support these claims. Beef-derived AAs and other nutrients enhance the metabolism (e.g., nitric-oxide and glutathione syntheses) and the functions of monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and other cells of the immune system, thereby helping the human host to kill pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.

A retrospective study was performed to determine the rate of port-site hernias as well as influencing risk factors for developing this complication. METHODS A review of all consecutive patients who underwent SILS over 4 years was conducted using electronic medical records in a multi-specialty integrated healthcare system. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographics in addition to bivariate and multivariate analyses of potential risk factors, which were age, gender, BMI, procedure, existing insertion-site hernia, wound infection, tobacco use, steroid use, and diabetes. RESULTS 787 patients who underwent SILS without conversion to open were reviewed. There were 454 cholecystectomies, 189 appendectomies, 72 colectomies, 21 fundoplications, 15 transabdominal inguinal herniorrhaphies, and 36 other surgeries. Cases included 532 (67.6 %) women, and among all patients mean age was 44.65 (19.05) years and mean BMI of 28.04 (6). Of these, 50 (6.35 %) patients were documented as developing port-site incisional hernias by a health care provider or by incidental imaging.

In developing countries including Ethiopia, where trained human resources and equipment for the treatment of COVID-19 are scarce, working on prevention of the viral spread should be a priority as a feasible intervention strategy. The aim of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 and its prevalence among hospital visitors. METHODS: Health institution based cross sectional study was conducted among 513 hospital visitors who are recruited by using simple random sampling technique at Ataye district hospital, Northeast Ethiopia from June 3, 2020 to August 10, 2020. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to obtain information related to socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge (11 questions), attitude (9 questions) and practice (9 questions). Oro-pharyngeal specimen was collected by trained healthcare provider and processed in a molecular laboratory. After extraction of viral nucleic acid, the Real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Data was analyzed using bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model with 95% CI (confidence interval). From the bi-variable analysis, variables having a P-value <0.25 were retained into multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables with a P-value <0.05 was declared as associated factors. RESULTS: Majority (72.9%) of the study participants were male; and most were urban dwellers. From the total study participants, 17 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The magnitude of low-level of knowledge was 4.9%; and of the analyzed risk factors, female gender, age (category less than 16 years and category between 16 and 65 years), and usual alcohol drinking habit had statistically significant association with low level knowledge. The proportion of study participants who had low level of practice was 75/513 (14.62%). Family size, age category between 16 and 65 years, and low-level knowledge were associated with low-level practice. CONCLUSION: Limited number of study participants had high-level knowledge and practice towards COVID-19; while majority of the study candidates demonstrated moderate level of knowledge and practice.

Requiring abstinence for shelter engagement is impractical for many with severe alcohol use disorders and poses a modifiable barrier to self-isolation orders. Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) have successfully increased housing adherence for those with physical alcohol dependence in Canada, but to our knowledge, they have not been implemented in the United States. To avoid life-threatening alcohol withdrawal syndromes and to support adherence to COVID-19 self-isolation and quarantine orders, MAPs were piloted by the public health departments of San Francisco and Alameda counties. Development of MAPs: We describe implementation of a first-in-the-nation alcohol use disorder intervention of a MAP that emerged at three public health isolation settings within San Francisco and Alameda counties in California. All three interventions utilized a similar process to develop the protocol and implement the MAP that included identification of champions for system-level advocacy and engagement of stakeholders.

She developed with a 4-day illness with fever, cough, and myalgia from which she made a full and uncomplicated recovery. Ten days later she developed a new erythematous itchy rash on her legs, trunk, and face and a progressive polyarthralgia affecting her MCPs, wrists, shoulders, hips, and knees. The rash typically lasted for 2 days at one site and was non-scarring. This was associated with a low-grade fever. There were no associated mouth ulcers, photosensitivity, alopecia, Raynauds, GI disturbance or respiratory symptoms. She had no relevant family history of autoimmunity, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease or travel history and had been prescribed no new medications. On examination, she had an erythematous rash on the face in a non malar distribution. She had multiple tender joints without definite synovitis. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastroenterology and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Investigations revealed a normal full blood count and CRP<1 with normal liver and renal function tests. Her urinalysis was unremarkable. Immunology was negative for ANA, ANCA and rheumatoid factor. Immunoglobulins were normal. Two weeks later her symptoms were fully resolved. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with nearly 30 strains recognised to infect humans. They induce both an innate and adaptive immune system response. It is hypothesised that a dysregulated innate system response, leading to a prolonged adaptive response triggers damaging inflammation and a potential cytokine storm. This is associated with poor outcome during primary viral infection. Variations in this immune response, with different underlying HLA genotypes could lead to other post infectious immune mediated phenomena, such as Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome - Temporally associated with COVID-19. There is a European registry collating data about patients with known rheumatic diseases who are admitted with COVID-19. There is emerging data regarding Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS).

Patients with PE were hospitalized after a longer time since symptoms onset (7 IQR 3C11 days, 3 IQR 1C6 days; p = 0.001) and showed higher D-dimers level (1819 IQR 568C5017 ng/ml vs 555 IQR 13C1530 ng/ml; p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of myocardial injury(47% vs 28%, p = 0.033). At multivariable analysis, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE; HR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.66C0.98; p = 0.046) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP; HR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03C1.23; p = 0.008) resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence. Mortality rates (50% vs 27%; p = 0.010) and cardiogenic shock (37% vs 14%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in PE as compared with non-PE patients. At multivariate analysis PE was significant associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: PE is relatively common complication in COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality risk. TAPSE and sPAP resulted the only parameters independently associated with PE occurrence in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients: Prevalence, predictors and clinical outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Registered midwives in British Columbia (BC) are primary health care practitioners for healthy people throughout pregnancy and for approximately 6 weeks postpartum. BC registered midwives are authorized to prescribe and administer certain vaccines to adults under their care during the perinatal period and hepatitis B vaccine to high\\\\risk newborns. However, little has been documented about their recommendations for, and administration of, prenatal and infant vaccinations. This study surveyed midwives currently practicing in British Columbia to understand their vaccination practices. METHODS: An online survey was administered to the members of the Midwives Association of BC in spring 2018. Outcome measures were the proportion of midwives who discussed, recommended, and administered the following vaccines: influenza, varicella, rubella, and infant hepatitis B. The proportion of midwives who discussed and recommended infant vaccines was measured. Barriers to discussion, recommendation, and administration of vaccines were captured. RESULTS: Sixty\\\\three percent of 108 respondents administered vaccines to their clients. Hepatitis B and rubella were the most frequent vaccines administered. Logistical concerns were the greatest barrier to vaccine administration. This was followed by the perception that vaccine administration is not within the scope of practice of midwives, especially for influenza vaccine. Midwives who administered vaccines were significantly more likely to discuss and recommend vaccines to their clients and their infants. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of BC midwives discuss, recommend, and administer vaccines to their clients. Our survey highlighted key areas to address to strengthen midwifery capacity to discuss, recommend, and provide prenatal and infant vaccines.","output":"Exploring vaccination practices of midwives in British Columbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human body is continuously threatened by pathogens, and the immune system must maintain a balance between fighting infection and becoming over-activated Mucosal surfaces cover several anatomically diverse organs throughout the body, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and are directly exposed to the external environment Various pathogens invade the body through mucosal surfaces, making the mucosa the frontline of immune defense The immune systems of various mucosal tissues display distinctive features that reflect the tissues' anatomical and functional characteristics This review discusses the cellular components that constitute the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts;in particular, it highlights the complex interactions between epithelial and immune cells to induce Ag-specific immune responses in the lung and gut This information on mucosal immunity may facilitate understanding of the defense mechanisms against infectious agents that invade mucosal surfaces, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and provide insight into effective vaccine development","output":"Recent Insights into Cellular Crosstalk in Respiratory and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Immune Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candidemia caused by Candida spp. is a serious threat in hospital settings being a major cause of acquired infection and death and a possible contributor to Covid-19 mortality.

Since then, reports of new onset diabetes (NODM) and diabetic ketoacidosis have been published (2, 3). This study aims to estimate the incidence of NODM among patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Basra, southern Iraq. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a retrospective crosssectional study conducted at Al-Mawani Hospital from October to December 2020 on 1011 patients. Data were extracted from records of patients admitted to COVID-19 wards and ICU. Patients were diagnosed as having NODM according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (4). Place of admission (isolation wards or ICU), patients' outcome (alive or dead), plasma glucose and insulin use were documented. Result(s): Males represent 58.4% of the participants. Mean age was 55.6 years. Approximately, 1/5 (20.5%) of the participants were managed at ICU. NODM was reported in 26.7% of the patients (44.8% of those who do not have past history of diabetes). Preexisting diabetes was reported in 40.4%. Accordingly, 679 (67.1%) were having diabetes both known and NODM. Mean plasma glucose for those with diabetes was = 334 mg/dL. Insulin therapy was used in 444 (65.3% of those with diabetes). Mortality rate was 24.3%. Those with NODM were more likely to be admitted to the isolation ward rather than ICU compared to those without (21.3% vs 18.5%, p=0,0005). In contrast, those with pre-existing diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU (22.4% vs 19.2%, p=0.0005). Mortality rate was higher among those with pre-existing diabetes than those with NODM (27.6% vs 21.1%, p=0.0005). Mortality rate among those with diabetes was more than those without (25% vs 22.8%, p=0005). Conclusion(s): A high incidence rate of NODM and prevalence rate of diabetes were reported in this cohort of patients. Quarter of patients admitted to the hospital for moderate-severe COVID-19 died. Inpatients insulin therapy was suboptimal. Future studies which include pre-admission data on glucose profile as well studies on the incidence of NODM among mild-moderate cases of COVID19 are required. Further prospective studies with a long follow up period are needed to better understand the outcome of NODM post COVID-19.

The organization of care was turned upside down. Patients with diabetes are at risk of severe forms of COVID-19 and their care was completely disrupted, especially in hospitals, outpatient follow-ups and offers of therapeutic education programs for diabetic patients (TPE-DB). Objectives: To describe the measures adopted by healthcare professionals for TPE-DB programs that were or were not maintained during the first lockdown. Methods: Questionnaire survey conducted of coordinators of TPE-DB programs, during the lockdown period from March 13 to May 11, 2020. Results: The coordinators of 153 TPE-DB programs responded to the survey: 72% (n=110) of programs were discontinued, 27% (n=42) continued with adapted programs when 7% (n=10) implemented specific activities related to COVID-19 and chronic disease. Conclusion: 1) The sudden stop of TPE-DB programs was due to several reasons: imposed closure of structures by authorities, redeployment of professionals to other medical activities, patients no longer consulting in departments. TPE was more integrated into care consultations and with rare exceptions, some patients were educated by those who remained in their posts. For the TPE programs that were maintained, they focused on the development of remote practice strengthening, adapting the content of the TPE. 2) This crisis highlighted the frailty of TPE, an activity that has often been sidelined. But it also provided opportunities for developing e-TPE programs; the respondents did not indicate whether these e-programs had been authorized by the regional health agencies (ARS). E-programs could now be integrated into patient care, however there is the risk of a digital divide for older people or those of low socio-cultural level.","output":"Adaptations des pratiques dETP destines aux personnes diabtiques en France durant la crise de la COVID-19 : enqute descriptive sur 153 programmes dETP durant le confinement de mars 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 crisis has posed an enormous challenge for all healthcare services.

New approaches to targeted therapy and immunotherapy represent the future in the field of oncology, making it essential to understand its effect on patients. Study endpoints were (a). To describe the percentage of nutritional counseling or nutritional support among those diagnosed as malnourished or at risk. And (b) to categorize the percentage and descriptive characteristics of cancer patients with mild, moderate, or severe malnutrition in Spain and descriptive characteristics of patients with malnutrition according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: From a total of 585 patients from 10 hospitals, two groups were established, group A, N: 408, patients undergoing immunotherapy, group B with patients with inmuno plus chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (N: 204). The objective of this observational study was to determine the prevalence (or risk) of malnutrition in the Spanish population of outpatients receiving immunotherapy. To do this, it was proposed to explore the nutritional status of these patients using Nutritional risk (NutriScore), Nutritional Global Subjective Assessment, ECOG PS;type of cancer and nutritional treatment: chemo, type of chemo, and COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: In group A (Immuno only) 28.3% of the patients were at risk of malnutrition, compared to 58.5% in group B (combined Immuno plus Chem&RT) with a statistically significant difference (p<0.0001);27.4% were on nutritional therapy, 97 (42.9%) of patients who obtained a score of 5 (at risk), and 63 (17.5%) %) of patients who obtained a score <5 (out of risk) in NutriScore (p<0.0001).

SLV213 (K777) is an orally administered small molecule protease inhibitor that exhibits in vitro activity against a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. To confirm efficacy in vivo, K777 was evaluated in an African green monkey (AGM) model of COVID-19. A pilot experiment was designed to test K777 in a prophylactic setting, animals were pre-treated with 100mg/kg K777 (N=4) or vehicle (N=2) before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. Initial data demonstrated that K777 treatment reduced pulmonary pathology compared to vehicle-treated animals. A second study was designed to test activity in a therapeutic setting, with K777 treatment (33 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) initiated 8 hours after exposure to the virus. In both experiments, animals received K777 daily via oral gavage for 7 days. Vehicle-treated animals exhibited higher lung weights, pleuritis, and diffuse alveolar damage. In contrast, lung pathology was reduced in K777-treated monkeys, and histopathological analyses confirmed the lack of diffuse alveolar damage. Antiviral effects were further demonstrated by quantitative reductions in viral load of samples collected from upper and lower airways.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and spike protein are crucial for viral replication and transmission. Spike protein recognizes the human ACE2 receptor and transmits SARS-CoV-2 into the human body. Thus, M(pro), spike protein, and ACE2 receptor act as appropriate targets for the development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Spices are traditionally known to have anti-viral and immune-boosting activities. Therefore, we investigated the possible use of selected spice bioactives against the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational analysis. METHODS: Molecular docking analysis was performed to analyze the binding efficiency of spice bioactives against SARS-CoV-2 target proteins along with the standard drugs. Drug-likeness properties of selected spice bioactives were investigated using Lipinski's rule of five and the SWISSADME database. Pharmacological properties such as ADME/T, biological functions, and toxicity were analyzed using ADMETlab, PASS-prediction, and ProTox-II servers, respectively. RESULTS: Out of forty-six spice bioactives screened, six bioactives have shown relatively better binding energies than the standard drugs and have a higher affinity with at least more than two targets of SARS-CoV-2. The selected bioactives were analyzed for their binding similarities with the standard drug, remdesivir, towards the targets of SARS-CoV-2. Selected spice bioactives have shown potential drug-likeness properties, with higher GI absorption rate, lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological roles.

ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17?-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","output":"Sex-Specific SARS-CoV-2 Mortality: Among Hormone-Modulated ACE2 Expression, Risk of Venous Thromboembolism and Hypovitaminosis D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are among the most common illnesses and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Here, we began by pursuing the hypothesis that circulating factors such as neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants, D-dimer, or C-reactive protein might predict the COVID-19 serum samples (n=118) that most robustly activated cultured endothelial cells. Indeed, we found modest correlations between serum NET remnants (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and upregulation of surface E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. However, a more robust predictor of the ability of COVID-19 serum to activate endothelial cells was the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and anti-phosphatidlyserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) IgG and IgM. Depletion of total IgG from anticardiolipin-high and anti-PS/PT-high samples markedly restrained upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. At the same time, supplementation of control serum with patient IgG was sufficient to trigger endothelial cell activation.

Our study is an attempt to deploy various computational methods to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes from the spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 which have the novel potential for vaccine development against COVID-19. For this we have taken 8 unique strains with one each from India, China, France, USA, Italy, Australia, Iran and Pakistan. The strain data was extracted from NCBI Database. By analyzing the immune parameters like surface accessibility, antigenicity, variability, conservancy, flexibility, hydrophilicity, allergenicity and toxicity of the conserved sequences of spike glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential novel linear (SGTNGTKRFDN and ASVYAWNRK) and one structural B-cell epitope as well as two T-cell epitopes (RLFRKSNLK and IPTNFTISV) which can be used as epitope-based peptide vaccines. Docking simulation assay revealed that above T-cell epitopes have minimum free binding energy and showed strong hydrogen bond interaction which strengthened its potential as being a T-cell epitope for the epitope-based novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Suramin sodium suppresses ATP generation during the glycolytic pathway and is ineffective against T. vivax and T. congolense infections. Resistance to suramin is associated with pathogen altered transport proteins. Melarsoprol binds irreversibly with pyruvate kinase protein sulfhydryl groups and neutralizes enzymes which interrupts the trypanosome ATP generation. Melarsoprol resistance is associated with the adenine-adenosine transporter, P2, due to point mutations within this transporter. Eflornithine is used in combination with nifurtimox. Resistance to eflornithine is caused by the deletion or mutation of TbAAT6 gene which encodes the transmembrane amino acid transporter that delivers eflornithine into the cell, thus loss of transporter protein results in eflornithine resistance. Nifurtimox alone is regarded as a poor trypanocide, however, it is effective in melarsoprol-resistant gHAT patients. Resistance is associated with loss of a single copy of the genes encoding for nitroreductase enzymes. Fexinidazole is recommended for first-stage and non-severe second-stage illnesses in gHAT and resistance is associated with trypanosome bacterial nitroreductases which reduce fexinidazole. In AAT, quinapyramine sulfate interferes with DNA synthesis and suppression of cytoplasmic ribosomal activity in the mitochondria. Quinapyramine sulfate resistance is due to variations in the potential of the parasite's mitochondrial membrane. Pentamidines create cross-links between two adenines at 4C5 pairs apart in adenine-thymine-rich portions of Trypanosoma DNA. It also suppresses type II topoisomerase in the mitochondria of Trypanosoma parasites. Pentamidine resistance is due to loss of mitochondria transport proteins P2 and HAPT1. Diamidines are most effective against Trypanosome brucei group and act via the P2/TbAT1 transporters. Diminazene aceturate resistance is due to mutations that alter the activity of P2, TeDR40 (T. b. evansi). Isometamidium chloride is primarily employed in the early stages of trypanosomiasis and resistance is associated with diminazene resistance. Phenanthridine (homidium bromide, also known as ethidium bromide) acts by a breakdown of the kinetoplast network and homidium resistance is comparable to isometamidium. In humans, the development of resistance and adverse side effects against monotherapies has led to the adoption of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy. Current efforts to develop new prodrug combinations of nifurtimox and eflornithine and nitroimidazole fexinidazole as well as benzoxaborole SCYX-7158 (AN5568) for HAT are in progress while little comparable progress has been done for the development of novel therapies to address trypanocide resistance in AAT.","output":"An Update on African Trypanocide Pharmaceutics and Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2002ؼԺۺSARS2012жۺMERSĹ״(CoV)֤ʵǴӶﴫġ2019͹״2019-nCov͹״׵ıٴ֤CoVཡشв2019-nCovȾϵͳ⣬оѪϵͳҲֺáĶ2019-nCovĻṹԼȾߵĲѧ˵ǱڻơƲԽʾٴҽע2019-nCovǱڷաǿ๦ܹ.","output":"[Cardiac manifestations of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and related treatment recommendations]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managing the airway in the intensive care unit (ICU) is complicated by a wide array of physiologic factors.

Findings: Low-income countries report a significantly lower average number of COVID-19 deaths compared to high-income countries. Community mobility and the easiness of carrying the virus from one place to another are significant factors affecting the number of deaths, while life expectancy is only significant in high-income countries.

Though behavioral health disorders can be successfully mitigated with early implementation of evidence-based parent management strategies, education for pediatric residents on behavioral health anticipatory guidance has been limited to date, with training challenges compounded by the physical distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) simulations provide an opportunity to train residents on this complex competency by allowing deliberate practice of necessary skills while adhering to current social distancing guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the usability of a VR-based behavioral health anticipatory guidance curriculum for pediatric residents. METHODS: This mixed methods study included 14 postgraduate third-year pediatric residents who completed the behavioral health anticipatory guidance VR curriculum. Residents completed the MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire to assess immersion in the virtual environment. Semistructured interviews were used to elucidate residents perspectives on the curriculums content and format. The interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Quantitatively, residents reported a high degree of immersion, spatial presence, and cognitive involvement. Most residents (11/14, 79%) agreed or strongly agreed that it seemed as though they took part in the action of the simulation. Qualitatively, two themes emerged from the data: (1) the curriculum expands behavioral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing knowledge and skills and (2) VR technology is uniquely positioned to develop competence. These themes revealed that the curriculum expanded their current level of knowledge and skill, addressed training gaps, and was applicable to all residents. Additionally, residents experienced VR as immersive, feasible, realistic to the clinic setting, and a safe space to practice and learn new skills. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data indicates that VR may be an effective tool to teach pediatric residents behavioral health anticipatory guidance, meeting a current gap in medical education training.

Strategies involving treating with remdesivir only patients with low-flow oxygen and patients with low-flow and high-flow oxygen were examined.

Extending remdesivir use to high-flow-oxygen patients would have amplified reductions in ICU-bed occupancy by up to 14% [18%; 11%]. A minimum remdesivir uptake of 20% was required to observe decreases in bed occupancy. Dexamethasone had effects of similar amplitude.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the utilization of SDD following shoulder arthroplasty. We hypothesize that patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic will have higher rates of SDD. METHODS: A retrospective continuous review was performed on 370 patients who underwent a primary anatomic (TSA) or reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) between August 2019 and December 2020 by a single surgeon. This group of patients represent the 185 arthroplasty cases completed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the first 185 patients after the start of the pandemic. April 1, 2020 was chosen as the cutoff for pre-COVID patients, as this represents the date a statewide ban on elective surgery was declared. All patients were counseled preoperatively regarding SDD and given the choice to stay overnight, unless medically contraindicated. Demographics, medical history, length of stay, 30 and 90-day readmissions, and 90-day emergency room (ER) and urgent care visits were obtained from medical records and compared. Two-tailed student t-tests, chi-square tests, and Fischers Exact were performed where appropriate. RESULTS: The two groups were similar in age, BMI, gender distribution, and Outpatient Arthroplasty Risk Assessment (OARA) score. During the collection period, there were more anatomic shoulder arthroplasties performed after (54%) than before (44%) the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.029). Patients treated after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were almost 3 times more likely to have a SDD (p<0.001), with 85.4% (158/185) of patients being discharged the same day following COVID-19, compared to 34.6% (64/185) before COVID-19. Discharge Disposition (location of discharge) was significantly different, as 99% (183/185) of patients undergoing surgery after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were discharged home, compared to 94% (174/185) of patients before COVID-19. There was no difference in 30-day readmissions, 90-day readmissions, and 90-day (ER) and urgent care visits between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted patient choices for SDD within a single surgeons practice, with nearly 3 times as many patients electing for SDD.

The present prospective comparison study was designed to determine the effects of variations in arterial blood pressure on the reliability of the FTV system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS Comparative measurements of cardiac output by FTV (derived from a femoral arterial line; software version 1.14) and IPATD were performed in 16 patients undergoing elective CABG in the period before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia, after sternotomy, and during five time points during graft preparation. During graft preparation, arterial blood pressure was increased stepwise in intervals of 10 to 15 minutes by infusion of noradrenaline and lowered thereafter to baseline levels. RESULTS Mean arterial blood pressure was varied between 85 mmHg and 115 mmHg. IPATD cardiac output did not show significant changes during periods with increased arterial pressure either during sternotomy or after pharmacological manipulation. In contrast, FTV cardiac output paralleled changes in arterial blood pressure; i.e. increased significantly if blood pressure was raised and decreased upon return to baseline levels. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and FTV cardiac output were closely correlated (r = 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 - 0.74), P < 0.0001) while no correlation between MAP and IPATD cardiac output was observed. Bland-Altman analyses for FTV versus IPATD cardiac output measurements revealed a bias of 0.4 l/min (8.5%) and limits of agreement from 2.1 to -1.3 l/min (42.2 to -25.3%). CONCLUSIONS Acute variations in arterial blood pressure alter the reliability of the FlowTrac/Vigileo device with the second-generation software.

SUMMARY ANSWER: WES has been successfully applied in combination with PGT-M by identifying new pathogenic mutations in addition to known gene mutations, extending the scope of PGT-M. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most couples ignore their risk of being a carrier of an inherited genetic disease until they have an affected child. Rare, atypical, and undiagnosed autosomal-recessive disorders frequently occur in the offspring of consanguineous couples. Routine single gene diagnostic tests fail to detect any possible gene defects other than the clinically apparent one. Prospective WES or genetic carrier screening testing of consanguineous couples could identify couples who both are carriers of autosomal recessive diseases and thus encourage them to make informed reproductive decisions. Screening tests using NGS technology simultaneously sequence exons and exon-intron boundaries to determine disease carrier status. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between January 2017 and October 2020, a total of 206 PGT-M couples applied to Istanbul Memorial Hospital ART Center. Of these couples, multigene PGT-M workups were carried for twelve couples who were carriers of more than one inherited disease. Eight couples were found to be carriers for two different diseases and four couples were carrying three diseases. All biopsies were performed at the blastocyst stage. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: For the 12 couples with multigene PGT-M workups the average female age was 31.0  6.2. Nine of them initiated an ART cycle and the mean number of cumulus-oocyte complexes, metaphaseII oocytes, biopsied blastocysts and transferrable PGT-M embryos were 15  6.9, 13.3  6.3, 5.9  2.0 and 2.9  1.9, respectively. PGT-A was routinely performed for all couples with transferrable PGT-M tested embryos except one couple who refused PGT-A. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 28 different gene workups were completed for 26 genes. The inheritance mode of the 26 conditions was as follows: 20 autosomal recessive, four autosomal dominant and two X-linked recessive. Out of 12 couples, 9 of them initiated an ART cycle and transferrable embryos were found after PGT-M followed by PGT-A. Eight women had frozen embryo transfers resulting in five healthy babies (3 singletons and 1 twin), two pregnancies still ongoing and one biochemical miscarriage at the time of data collection. The couple who declined PGT-A testing prior to their frozen embryo transfer had anegative bhCG test. Three couples completed their workups but postponed their ART and PGT-M cycle due to CovidC19 pandemic. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The probability of finding at least one transferrable embryo after PGT-M is influenced by the inheritance mode of the disease. Late-onset diseases presumed to be caused by variants of unknown significance and polygenic diseases that are possibly influenced by environmental factors were not included in this study. Wider implications of the findings: With decreasing costs and improved availability of WES and genetic carrier screening panels, couples, especially consanguineous couples, who were previously shown to have one inherited disease may be offered to be screened for additional undiagnosed inherited diseases that may pose a threat for their offspring.

Magnetic resonance 1.5T images were obtained from schizophrenia (n = 47), schizoaffective disorder (n = 15), and from healthy control (n = 42) participants, matched for age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, and race. The caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were characterized using high-dimensional brain mapping procedures (Csernansky et al., 2004b). Results revealed significant shape deformations between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder that also differed from control subjects. Relative to schizophrenia, schizoaffective subjects showed exaggerated inward deformations indicative of localized volume loss in subregions of the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus (all p < 0.001). These shape features correlated with mental flexibility and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (all p < 0.05), but not schizoaffective disorder.

While taste perception in the laboratory has been widely studied, it has rarely been taken into account when exploring dietary patterns in a population (3). The aim of this work is to identify consumers' taste perceptions for a list of foods. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme year 9 was used to generate a list of foods consumed by adolescents (10-19 years old). 1748 different foods were grouped by type/food group, and/or sugar/salt contents into 7 main and 23 subgroups. A pilot test identified foods with high agreement to further limit the list. The shortened food list was included in an online survey which was distributed to Facebook groups and Twitter. Food-taste classification questions asked participants to allocate one main taste to each food: sweet, salty, sour, bitter and savoury/umami;neutral and never tried. To minimize participant burden, the food list was divided into 3 and participants were asked to complete one part with an option to complete the rest. Foods were allocated to taste categories based on agreement by  50% of respondents. If there was a &lt; 50% agreement, foods were classified by allocation to two+ taste categories based on the highest scoring taste combinations The pilot questionnaire was completed by 19 participants. 15/19 rated 55 foods as the same taste and these were removed from the final questionnaire. The final food list contained 184 items. The main online questionnaire obtained 209 responses from 162 females, 44 males, (3 not known). The age range was from 18-70+ years with the majority between 40-59 years old. Seven reported having COVID-19, but only 3 were tested positive (none experienced a taste loss). Food items were classified as 29% neutral, 22% sweet, 11% savoury/umami, 9% salty, 7% bitter, and 5% sour. Six mixed tastes categories were identified: savoury/umami-salty (11%), sweet-sour (3%), sweet-bitter (2%), sour-bitter (1%), salty-bitter (0.5%) and savoury/umami-bitter (1%). In the next step of the study, taste categories will be applied to the remaining foods consumed by adolescents reported in the NDNS to generate taste patterns allowing us to explore links with nutrition and anthropometry.

Therefore, determining whether a history of suicide attempt is associated with COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder has implications for COVID-19 vulnerability stratification in this patient population. METHODS: We carried out cross-sectional analyses of electronic health records of veterans with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that received treatment at any United States Veterans Affairs Medical Center between January 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We used logistic regression to estimate unadjusted and adjusted (including age, sex, race, marital status, body mass index (BMI), and a medical comorbidity score) odds ratios (ORs) for COVID-19 positivity in suicide attempters relative to nonattempters. RESULTS: A total of 101,032 veterans (mean age 56.67  13.13 years; males 91,715 [90.8%]) were included in the analyses. There were 2,703 (2.7%) suicide attempters and 719 (0.7%) patients were positive for COVID-19. The association between history of suicide attempt and COVID-19 positivity was modified by age and BMI, such that the relationship was only significant in patients younger than 59 years, and in obese (BMI 30) patients (adjusted OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.02C5.79 and OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.65C4.94, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of COVID-19 in young or obese suicide attempters with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder might be due to the elevated risk for the infection in this subgroup of patients.","output":"History of Suicide Attempts and COVID-19 Infection in Veterans with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder: Moderating Effects of Age and Body Mass Index"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) of turkeys and runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) of chickens are significant viral enteric diseases of poultry. Although a number of different viruses, including avian reoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses and coronaviruses, have been isolated from the intestinal contents of birds in affected poultry flocks, their role in PEMS and RSS is not yet understood. Here, we report the application of a molecular screening method to detection of novel viruses in intestinal samples of chickens and turkeys exhibiting characteristic signs of enteric disease. The technique is based on random amplification of particle-associated nucleic acids in clinical samples. Using this method we successfully identified parvovirus DNA sequences in intestinal homogenates of affected birds. This is the first time partial genomic sequences of autonomously replicating chicken and turkey parvoviruses have been described. Sequence analysis of the left end of the genome, including the complete non-structural gene, demonstrated that the chicken and turkey parvoviruses were closely related to each other and were representative of a novel member of the Parvovirus family.

Although often subtle, lamina propria between and around the neoplastic glands (identified by plasma cells, scattered eosinophils, etc.) is frequent in cases with classic morphology, arguing (at least in such cases) in favor of adenoma extending into lymphoglandular complexes rather than true invasive carcinoma. Some have postulated that the tumor arises from M-cells, specialized epithelial cells overlying GALT, and others have suggested it represents a unique pathway to carcinoma, specific to the environmental conditions of epithelium overlying lymphoid tissue. Although both hypotheses are intriguing, definitive phenotypic and genetic support is currently lacking. To address these possibilities, we undertook whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemical characterization of a GALT neoplasm recently identified on our clinical service. We discovered well-known mutations in both APC and KRAS, as well as mutations in several Wnt pathway components (MED12, BCL9L, RFX4, DACT3). No immunohistochemical expression of GP2, a marker of M-cell differentiation, was identified. Expression of CDX2, SATB2, and the DNA mismatch repair proteins was observed, while expression of both CK7 and CK20 was absent. No PD-L1 expression was present on tumor cells, but PD-L1 expression was noted in a subset of tumor-adjacent mononuclear cells. Overall, the findings suggest that GALT neoplasms, although morphologically distinct, may be a precursor or early form of typical sporadic colon carcinoma.","output":"Whole exome sequencing of a gut-associated lymphoid tissue neoplasm points to precursor or early form of sporadic colon carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented human and health crisis.

Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support. This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm.

We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients. RESULTS: Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy. In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications. In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.

Therefore, improvements in crop production have always been a prime objective to meet the demands of an ever-growing population. In the last decade, studies have acknowledged the role of photosynthesis augmentation and enhancing nutrient use efficiency (NUE) in improving crop production. Recently, the applications of nanobionics in crop production have given hope with their lucrative properties to interact with the biological system. Nanobionics have significantly been effective in modulating the photosynthesis capacity of plants. It is documented that nanobionics could assist plants by acting as an artificial photosynthetic system to improve photosynthetic capacity, electron transfer in the photosystems, and pigment content, and enhance the absorption of light across the UV-visible spectrum. Smart nanocarriers, such as nanobionics, are capable of delivering the active ingredient nanocarrier upon receiving external stimuli. This can markedly improve NUE, reduce wastage, and improve cost effectiveness. Thus, this review emphasizes the application of nanobionics for improving crop yield by the two above-mentioned approaches. Major concerns and future prospects associated with the use of nanobionics are also deliberated concisely.","output":"Nanobionics in Crop Production: An Emerging Approach to Modulate Plant Functionalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers SEPIR, the extension of an existing parametric SEIR continuous simulation compartment model. Both models can be fitted to real data as they include parameters that can simply be estimated from the data. However SEPIR deploys an additional presymptomatic (also called asymptomatic) infectious stage that is not included in SEIR but which is known to exist in COVID-19. This stage is also parametrised and so can be fitted to data. Both SEPIR and the existing SEIR model assume a homogeneous mixing population, an idealisation that is unrealistic in practice when dynamically varying control strategies are deployed against virus. This means that if either model is to represent more than just a single period in the behaviour of the epidemic, then the parameters of the model will have to be time dependent.

However, image artifacts, respiratory motion, and challenging scenarios could limit the accuracy of multimodality image registration necessary before image overlay. Ensuring the accuracy of registration during interventional procedures is therefore critically important. The goal of this study was to develop a novel framework that has the ability to assess the quality (i.e., accuracy) of nonrigid multimodality image registration accurately in near real time. We constructed a solution using registration quality metrics that can be computed rapidly and combined to form a single binary assessment of image registration quality as either successful or poor. Based on expert-generated quality metrics as ground truth, we used a supervised learning method to train and test this system on existing clinical data. Using the trained quality classifier, the proposed framework identified successful image registration cases with an accuracy of 81.5%. The current implementation produced the classification result in 5.5 s, fast enough for typical interventional radiology procedures.

OBJECTIVE We performed a prospective analysis of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients during and after hospitalization. METHODS We enrolled 171 COVID-19 intensive care unit patients. POCUS of the lungs was performed with phased array (2-4 MHz), convex (2-6 MHz) and linear (10-15 MHz) transducers, scanning 12 lung areas. Chest computed tomography angiography was performed to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism. Survivors were clinically and sonographically evaluated during a 4 month period for evidence of residual lung injury. Chest computed tomography angiography and echocardiography were used to exclude pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chest high-resolution-computed-tomography to exclude interstitial lung disease (ILD) in symptomatic survivors. RESULTS Cox regression analysis showed that lymphocytopenia (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.68-0.96, p = 0.048), increased lactate (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.46, p = 0.049), and D-dimers (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.44, p = 0.03) were mortality predictors. Non-survivors had increased incidence of pulmonary abnormalities (B-lines, pleural line irregularities, and consolidations) compared to survivors (p < 0.05). During follow-up, POCUS with clinical and laboratory parameters integrated in the semi-quantitative Riyadh-Residual-Lung-Injury scale had sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.89) and specificity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.94-0.95) in predicting ILD. The prevalence of PH and ILD (non-specific-interstitial-pneumonia) was 7% and 11.8%, respectively.

Early in the pandemic, the seemingly low African case count was largely attributed to low testing and case reporting. However, there is reason to consider that many African countries attenuated the spread and impacts early on. Factors explaining low spread include early government community-wide actions, population distribution, social contacts, and ecology of human habitation.

Around two billion people worldwide suffer from food insecurity and hidden hunger. Food insecurity and associated factors among pregnant women in Gedeo Zone Public Hospitals, Southern Ethiopia, are the focus of this study. Method From May to June 2021 G.C. institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women in Gedeo zone public hospitals. A sample of 506 women has been used, and a multistage cluster sampling technique was used. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the association between various factors and outcomes. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant in multivariable regression. Results Food insecurity was found to be prevalent in 67.4% of pregnant mothers. The results of a multivariable logistic regression revealed that pregnant women from rural areas [AOR=0.532, 95% CI: 0.285, 0.994], married [AOR=0.232, 95% CI: 0.072, 0.750], have a secondary education [AOR=0.356, 95%CI: 0.154, 0.822], and be employed [AOR=0.453, 95% CI: 0.236, 0.872], income between 1000 and 2000 [AOR=0.163, 95% CI: 0.066, 0.399], and income greater than 2000 [AOR=0.125, 95% CI: 0.053,0.293], the wealth index middle and rich [AOR=0.441, 95% CI: 0.246, 0.793] were significant predictors of food insecurity among pregnant mothers [AOR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.128, 0.449].

The purpose of this study was to analyze the preference and subjective design features of 133 existing icons associated with COVID-19 prevention measures published by the health and medical organizations of different countries. The 133 icons represent nineteen different function names, such as Wash Hands and Wear Face Mask. A total of 57 participants were recruited to perform two different tests: ranking test and subjective rating test. The ranking test was conducted to elicit the preference ranking of seven icon designs representing each function name. It was followed by a subjective rating test using 13 semantic scales on the two most preferred icons to analyze their perceived quality. Spearmen correlation was applied to derive the possible correlations between users rankings and the semantic scales, and Friedmans test was also performed to determine the true difference between ranking in terms of each semantic scale to provide a fully meaningful interpretation of the data. Generally, findings from the current study showed that the image presented in the icon is the key point that affects the icons perceived quality. Interestingly, Spearmans correlation analysis between preference ranking and semantic scales showed that vagueCclear, weakCstrong, incompatibleCcompatible, and ineffectiveCeffective were the four strongest semantic scales that highly correlated with the preference ranking. Considering the significant relationships between the semantic distances and the functions, images depicted in an icon should be realistic and as close as possible to its respected function to cater to users preferences. In addition, the results of Spearmans correlation and Friedmans test also inferred that compatibility and clarity of icon elements are the main factors determining a particular icons preferability. This study is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the icons associated with the COVID-19 prevention measures. The findings of this study can be utilized as the basis for redesigning icons, particularly for icons related to COVID-19 prevention measures.

Resistant birds, although infected, were unable to transmit virus to contact birds, as ultimately only the presence of a sustained cloacal shedding (and not oropharyngeal shedding) was critical for transmission. Restriction of within-bird transmission of virus occurred in the resistant line, with intra-nares or cloacal infection resulting in only local shedding and failing to transmit fully through the gastro-intestinal-pulmonary tract. Resistance to infection was independent of adaptive immune responses, including the expansion of specific IFN secreting cells or production of influenza-specific antibody.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study compared patients with MI who underwent invasive coronary angiography at New York University from March-April 2020, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic, with those presenting in March-April 2019. RESULTS: Only 35 patients with MI underwent angiography during the study period in 2020 vs 109 patients in 2019. No differences in comorbidities or baseline medications were identified. The proportion of patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (48.6% vs 24.8%, respectively;P=.01). Median peak troponin concentration was higher (14.5 ng/mL vs 2.9 ng/mL;P<.01) and left ventricular ejection fraction was lower (43.34% vs 51.1%;P=.02) during the pandemic.

METHODS The 24 novice participants in this study performed the FLS peg transfer task using two conventional laparoscopic 12-mm working ports, the SILS port, the TriPort access system, and the GelPOINT system with two standard length 5-mm graspers. Each participant completed the task using conventional laparoscopy first for familiarization, followed by each of the three LESS surgical ports in random order. Task completion time, errors, and subjective questionnaire ratings were used to compare conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Congruent with FLS scoring procedures, task completion time and errors were used to compute a standardized task score for each port. RESULTS The task score did not differ significantly between conventional laparoscopy and the single-port devices. Additionally, there were no task score differences between trials for either the SILS port or the GelPOINT system. There was a significant performance decrement starting with the TriPort versus starting with either the SILS port or the GelPOINT, which resulted in the lowest overall trial task score (p<0.05).

This is a case series performed at 4 academic tertiary care centers in Paris of all the children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with shock, fever and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 15th and April 27th, 2020. Results: 20 critically ill children admitted for shock had an acute myocarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35% (25C55); troponin, 269 ng/mL (31C4607)), and arterial hypotension with mainly vasoplegic clinical presentation. The first symptoms before PICU admission were intense abdominal pain and fever for 6 days (1C10). All children had highly elevated C-reactive protein (&gt; 94 mg/L) and procalcitonin (&gt; 1.6 ng/mL) without microbial cause. At least one feature of Kawasaki disease was found in all children (fever, n = 20, skin rash, n = 10; conjunctivitis, n = 6; cheilitis, n = 5; adenitis, n = 2), but none had the typical form. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were positive for 10 and 15 children, respectively. One child had both negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology, but had a typical SARS-CoV-2 chest tomography scan. All children but one needed an inotropic/vasoactive drug support (epinephrine, n = 12; milrinone, n = 10; dobutamine, n = 6, norepinephrine, n = 4) and 8 were intubated.

However, there was no difference between these viruses in the potential to induce apoptosis in cultured cells. The apoptosis in the brain did not appear to result from the direct viral attack, since apoptotic cells were found in the lesion where viral antigens were barely detected. The present study suggests that the amino acids mutated in the S protein of srr mutants, especially the amino acid at position 1114 mutated in srr7, influence the neurovirulence in mice.","output":"Neurovirulence in mice of soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants of mouse hepatitis virus: intensive apoptosis caused by less virulent srr mutant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Diarrhoea is the most common manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Africa. Numerous parasitic or bacterial agents have been implicated, but a pathogen-specific aetiology has not been found. Enteric viruses (i.e., rotavirus, small round structured viruses, coronavirus, and adenovirus) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electron microscopy in faecal specimens of 17% of 198 consecutive adult admissions to a general medical ward of an urban hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization Aids stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms. However, a trend (P = 014) towards greater frequency of virus in stools from patients in the lower 3 quintiles of the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio was seen. This trend approached statistical significance (P = 007) with stratification by HIV infection.

Myalgia has been recognized as a symptom of long COVID syndrome. The treatment for long COVID syndrome-related myalgia lacks research. Dry needling is a technique that involves the insertion of a needle into the tissue of, or overlaying, a pain point. Wet needling is the addition of an injection of an analgesic substance such as lidocaine while performing needling. Both dry and wet needling have are practiced as treatment modalities for myofascial pain. Limited literature exists to define long COVID syndrome-related myalgia and its relation to myofascial pain, or to examine the utility of needling techniques for this pain. We report a case of dry and wet needling as effective treatments for long COVID-related myofascial pain. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old, previously healthy Hispanic male with no comorbid conditions was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered moderate disease without hypoxia and was never hospitalized. Three months later, the patient continued to suffer from symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, brain fog, and myalgia. An extensive multisystem workup revealed normal cardiac, pulmonary, and end organ functions. The patient was then diagnosed with long COVID syndrome. The nature and chronicity of the patients myalgia meet the criteria for myofascial pain. Both wet and dry needling were used to treat the patients myofascial pain, with good short- and long-term therapeutic effects. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection has been shown to exacerbate preexisting myofascial pain syndrome. Our case report indicates that long COVID syndrome-related myalgia is likely a form of new-onset myofascial pain. Additionally, both wet and dry needling can be utilized as an effective treatment modality for this pain syndrome, with short- and long-term benefits.","output":"Trigger point injections and dry needling can be effective in treating long COVID syndrome-related myalgia: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical consequences of extended interval dosing (EID) of ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In our retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we compared patients with RRMS on EID (defined as 4-week delay of dose interval) with a control group on standard interval dosing (SID) at the same period (January to December 2020). RESULTS: Three hundred eighteen patients with RRMS were longitudinally evaluated in 5 German centers. One hundred sixteen patients received ocrelizumab on EID (median delay [interquartile range 8.68 [5.09C13.07] weeks). Three months after the last ocrelizumab infusion, 182 (90.1%) patients following SID and 105 (90.5%) EID patients remained relapse free (p = 0.903). Three-month confirmed progression of disability was observed in 18 SID patients (8.9%) and 11 EID patients (9.5%, p = 0.433). MRI progression was documented in 9 SID patients (4.5%) and 8 EID patients (6.9%) at 3-month follow-up (p = 0.232). Multivariate logistic regression showed no association between treatment regimen and no evidence of disease activity status at follow-up (OR: 1.266 [95% CI: 0.695C2.305]; p = 0.441). Clinical stability was accompanied by persistent peripheral CD19(+) B-cell depletion in both groups (SID vs EID: 82.6% vs 83.3%, p = 0.463). Disease activity in our cohort was not associated with CD19(+) B-cell repopulation. CONCLUSION: Our data support EID of ocrelizumab as potential risk mitigation strategy in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The RA column was composed of hydrophobic inner column (poly(styrene-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and hydrophilic outer layer (poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate chain) which was grafted on the hydrophobic surface by means of the second ARGET-ATRP reaction. The as-prepared RA monolithic tip was connected to a 2mL syringe for directly extracting magnolol and honokiol from rat plasma just by manually pushing operation. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the column were characterized by scanning electronic microscope, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy respectively. The determined results of evaluation experiments based on the optimized solid phase extraction conditions showed that the RA column possessed good protein exclusion power, extraction recovery and reusability. The constructed RA-SPE-HPLC/UV method for simultaneously analyzing magnolol and honokiol in rat plasma was validated with quality control (QC) samples at four concentration levels. Good precision (RSDs, 3.39~11.16%) and acceptable accuracy (relative recoveries, 89.52%~108.42%) were obtained for intra- and inter-day assays.

This image analysis produced two coefficients that represent the fraction of co-localizing objects in each component of a dual-channel image. The generation of test objects with a Gaussian intensity distribution, at well-defined positions in both components of dual-channel images, allowed an accurate investigation of the reliability of the procedure. To do that, the co-localization coefficients were determined before degrading the image with background, cross-talk and Poisson noise. These synthesized sources of image deterioration represent sources of deterioration that must be dealt with in practical confocal imaging, namely dark current, non-specific binding and cross-reactivity of fluorescent probes, optical cross-talk and photon noise. The degraded images were restored by filtering and cross-talk correction. The co-localization coefficients of the restored images were not significantly different from those of the original undegraded images. Finally, we tested the procedure on images of real biological specimens. The results of these tests correspond with data found in the literature.

The initial response to invading pathogens is mediated by the recognition through various pattern-recognition receptors along with cellular engulfment resulting in a coordinated release of soluble effector molecules and cytokines aiming to terminate the external stimuli. Members of the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family have the capability to proteolytically cleave transmembrane molecules close to the plasma membrane, a process called ectodomain shedding. In fact, in infectious diseases dysregulation of numerous ADAM substrates such as junction molecules (e.g., E-cadherin, VE-cadherin, JAM-A), adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, L-selectin), and chemokines and cytokines (e.g., CXCL16, TNF-) has been observed.

Yet, research and practice are lacking solid measurement instruments assessing digital communication and collaboration competencies of workers so far. Furthermore, it is yet unknown if digital communication and collaboration competencies and other so far known resources indeed act as drivers of work engagement during the pandemic. Based on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model and the conservation of resources theory, we hypothesized that personal (digital communication and collaboration competencies) and job (social support) resources positively influence each other over time, also boosting work engagement. In a cross-lagged study design during the pandemic, we investigated our hypotheses in a sample of German workers (N = 231). Against our expectations, we did not find support for effects from personal or job resources on work engagement over time or effects of the resources influencing each other. Instead, we found high stabilities of digital communication and collaboration competencies and work engagement. Our results provide important insights into the motivational process of individuals working during a pandemic.

Little is known about the factors associated with household transmission, at the level of the case, contact or household, or how these have varied over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. RESULTS: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66-0.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","output":"HOSTED-England's Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset: preliminary findings from a novel passive surveillance system of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public transport was already one of the biggest issues for all municipalities where people are highly concentrated at the same space at the same time With COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing consequences, mass transportation is actually the main barrier for students and workers dependents of transport to go back to their daily routines with comfort and safety Thus, the objective is to determine a demand control able to equalize the number of passengers in each car, respecting the COVID-19 social distancing protocols The number of passengers in each time-of-day range were combined in four different models that included independent variables related to passengers behavior indicating that almost 90% of all passengers are following a very strict and straight daily routine that can be coordinated and scheduled creating enough time space one from the other to avoid undesirable concentrations inside buses and bus stops In conclusion, a very accurate urban management tool can arise from the study and may be able to solve not only the pandemic issues but also to improve local public services efficiency, to attract private investments and to improve citizen's quality of life","output":"Challenges for Public Transportation: consequences and possible alternatives for the Covid-19 pandemic through strategic digital city application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Chest radiographs are the mainstay of initial radiological investigation in this COVID-19 pandemic.

Some technologies, including Active(+)me, were used without knowing their benefits. We assessed changes in patient activation measure (PAM) in patients participating in routine CR, using Active(+)me. We also investigated changes in PAM among low, moderate, and high risk patients, changes in cardiovascular risk factors, and explored patient and healthcare professional experiences of using Active(+)me. METHODS: Patients received standard CR education and an exercise prescription. Active(+)me was used to monitor patient health, progress towards goals, and provide additional lifestyle support. Patients accessed Active(+)me through a smart-device application which synchronised to telemetry enabled scales, blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeter, and activity trackers. Changes in PAM score following CR were calculated. Sub-group analysis was conducted on patients at high, moderate, and low risk of exercise induced cardiovascular events. Qualitative interviews explored the acceptability of Active(+)me. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were recruited (Age: 60.4  10.9 years; BMI: 27.9  5.0 kg(.)m(2); 78.3% male). PAM scores increased from 65.5 (range: 51.0 to 100.0) to 70.2 (range: 40.7 to 100.0; P = 0.039). PAM scores of high risk patients increased from 61.9 (range: 53.0 to 91.0) to 75.0 (range: 58.1 to 100.0; P = 0.044). The PAM scores of moderate and low risk patients did not change. Resting systolic blood pressure decreased from 125 mmHg (95% CI: 120 to 130 mmHg) to 119 mmHg (95% CI: 115 to 122 mmHg; P = 0.023) and waist circumference measurements decreased from 92.8 cm (95% CI: 82.6 to 102.9 cm) to 85.3 cm (95% CI 79.1 to 96.2 cm; P = 0.026). Self-reported physical activity levels increased from 1557.5 MET-minutes (range: 245.0 to 5355.0 MET-minutes) to 3363.2 MET-minutes (range: 105.0 to 12,360.0 MET-minutes; P < 0.001).

Bangladesh, a country of 170 million people, is not an exception regarding COVID-19; it has reported several thousand COVID-19 patients with several hundred of deaths. This observational study has been planned to assess the scope and limitation of management strategy against COVID-19 patients in a medical college hospital of Bangladesh with available drugs in a real-life situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients in this cohort (N: 33) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and they attended the hospital with variable presenting symptoms those ranged from cough and fever to respiratory distress and pneumonia. As per the protocol, the patients were regularly evaluated for several parameters of COVID-19-related pathology. Before discharge, they were checked for SARS-CoV-2 for 2 consecutive times. The management strategy included standard of care (SoC) and administration of hydroxychloroquine and azythromycin, available in Bangladesh. RESULTS: Out of total 33 patients, 1 patient died at day 4 day after admission. Two patients developed severe complications and were referred to tertiary hospital in Dhaka (2 and 3 days after admission), the capital of Bangladesh, where they recovered and were discharged from hospital after being SARS-CoV-2 negative. The rest 30 patients were discharged from the medical college hospital after being negative for SARS-CoV-2 in two subsequent assessments and improvement of their COVID-related symptoms. The average hospital stay of these patients was 14.5 days with a range of 10C24 days. CONCLUSION: It seems that most of the COVID-19 patients may be adequately managed by standard of care management with drug support. However, early diagnosis and hospitalization with adequate care may be important variables for better survival.

We report here that under DM stress, interfering Ran or nuclear transport factor Ntf2 by RNAi could suppress the nuclear import of nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 which then down-regulates the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes (Cyp4d20, Cyp4ae1, GstD5, Sod3, etc.), ultimately resulting in a significant apoptosis of Drosophila Kc cells. In contrast, after overexpressing Ran in Kc cells, Nrf2 has a higher concentration in the nucleus, and the expressions of detoxification enzyme genes are up-regulated, while the DM-induced apoptosis is significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, we preliminary found silencing Ntf2 or Ran could prevent the nuclear import of transcription factor Dif under DM stress, subsequently decreased expressions of antimicrobial peptide genes (Drsl1).

The Nursing Workplace Satisfaction questionnaire was used to collect data online via social media platforms, and consisted of Likert Scale responses, and both closed and opened ended questions. RESULTS: The quantitative results noted an overall positive result to participants job satisfaction, however there were areas that participants reported as problematic. These areas were delved into further via the results of the qualitative data which highlighted eight themes that explored the participants perception of the worst things that impacted upon their job satisfaction, and also the best things which impacted in relation to their current jobs. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed factors including staff shortages, being time-poor, missing basic human rights like meals and comfort breaks which were linked to midwives dissatisfaction with their jobs in Australia. The study also identified that midwives valued being of service to women, and that this factor was a driving force in job satisfaction.","output":"A mixed-methods pilot study exploring midwives job satisfaction: Is being of service to women the key?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Use of technological gadgets has rapidly been increasing among adolescents, which may result in health issues and technology addiction. This study focuses on the prevalence of usage of technological gadgets and health\\\\related complications among secondary school\\\\going children of Bangladesh. METHODS: A total of 1803 secondary school students from 21 different districts of Bangladesh participated in the study. The children were asked questions relating to their access to electronic gadgets, time spent on outdoor activities, and whether they experienced any health\\\\complications as an after\\\\effect of the usage. A binary logistic regression model was adapted considering time spent on gadgets as an independent variable and health problems (physical and mental) as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Among all the gadgets, 67.11% of the participants were reported to use mobile phones on a daily basis. Due to the ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic, 24.48% of respondents used electronic gadgets for attending online classes. The participants were reported to use gadgets significantly more (P < .05) in 2020 as compared to 2019. Children showed less tendency to spend time in outdoor activities. More than 50% of the participants spend time doing outdoor activities for less than 1 hour daily. An association between gadget use and health problems like headache, backache, visual disturbance, and sleeping disturbance has been observed in our study. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that different socio\\\\demographic factors have influence on the use of gadgets by children, and this use has greatly been affecting both the physical and mental health of the secondary school\\\\going students of Bangladesh.","output":"Prevalence and impact of the use of electronic gadgets on the health of children in secondary schools in Bangladesh: A cross\\\\sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Virus population disease dynamics in various species of ecosystem keep the research interests alive for many centuries.

The conditions for the extinction and permanence of the viral infection in the interacting populations has been found, analyzed and supported with numerical simulations. An application to HIV infection model has also been presented for drawing a comparative study of the model under various modeling methods.

Assessing community knowledge and behavior could help in designing effective health-care policies tailored to the need of target population. AIMS: We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) about COVID-19 among Kashmiri population and to determine the association of KAP scores with the sociodemographic variables. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study conducted via various online platforms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire was formulated which was divided into three scoring sections assessing KAP about COVID-19 and a nonscoring section assessing individual reactions. A link to the survey was disseminated through social media platforms. A total of 1051 individuals participated. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics were used for assessing the demographic characteristics of participants. Inferential statistics (MannCWhitney U-test and KruskalCWallis test) were used for comparison. RESULTS: Majority of the participants belonged to the age group of 20C39 years (75.4%), were unmarried (66.6%), were from urban background (54.9%), and had education of above high school (96.3%). In general, scores suggested that participants possessed adequate knowledge (mean  standard deviation: 10.07  1.134), had good attitudes (11.85  1.42), and followed good practices (12.26  1.42) regarding COVID-19.

First, there is a viral phase that may well be asymptomatic or mild in the majority, perhaps 80% of patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in minimal disease in this initial phase are not well known. In the remaining 20% of cases, the disease may become severe and/or critical. In most patients of this latter group, there is a phase characterized by the hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. A third phase corresponds to a state of hypercoagulability.

Now the world is ravaged by COVID-19, with tremendous loss of life, economic and societal disruption, and dire predictions of more destructive and frequent pandemics. There are now calls to tightly regulate and even enact complete wildlife trade bans, while others call for more nuanced approaches since many rural communities rely on wildlife for sustenance. Given pressures from political and societal drivers and resource limitations to enforcing bans, increased regulation is a more likely outcome rather than broad bans. But imposition of tight regulations will require monitoring and assessing trade situations for zoonotic risks. We present a tool for relevant stakeholders, including government authorities in the public health and wildlife sectors, to assess wildlife trade situations for risks of potentially serious zoonoses in order to inform policies to tightly regulate and control the trade, much of which is illegal in most countries. The tool is based on available knowledge of different wildlife taxa traded in the Asia-Pacific Region and known to carry highly virulent and transmissible viruses combined with relative risks associated with different broad categories of market types and trade chains.","output":"A tool for rapid assessment of wildlife markets in the Asia-Pacific Region for risk of future zoonotic disease outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to over 94 million confirmed cases and over 2 million deaths globally (John Hopkins CRC, 2021).

We have examined the effects of GDP (allocated to pandemics and health), education, gender, cultural factors, number of physicians (per 1000 of the population) on the death rate. A correlation between the death rate and socio-economic conditions has been observed. The finding shows that power distance, individualism, gender, and age affect the death rate more than other socio-economic factors we use. We have also performed the same analysis by using Lockdown levels as a moderator. Lockdown levels have a more significant moderating effect on cultural factors rather than the other socio-economic factors. However, due to the topic's sensitivity, we still need to pay attention to the socio-economic factors that may have lower levels of significant relationship with the death rate, since even 0.1 % of changes in coefficients of our other socio-economic variables could mean thousands of lives.

The aging lung is transcriptionally characterized by increased cell adhesion and stress responses, with reduced mitochondria and cellular replication. Deconvolution analysis reveals that the proportions of alveolar type 2 cells, proliferating basal cells, goblet cells, and proliferating natural killer/T cells decrease with age, whereas alveolar fibroblasts, pericytes, airway smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and IGSF21(+) dendritic cells increase with age. Several age-associated genes directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Age-associated genes are also dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in patients with severe COVID-19.

IPH rates are high with the current standard of care, forced air warming (FAW). Our hypothesis is that a prototype thermal compression device that heats the popliteal fossa and soles of the feet, with lower leg compression, increases perioperative temperatures and reduces IPH compared to the current standard of care. METHODS Thirty six female breast surgery patients, at a tertiary academic hospital, were randomized to the device or intraoperative FAW (stage I) with a further 18 patients randomized to the device with a single heating area only (stage II, popliteal fossa or sole of the feet). Stage I: 37 patients recruited (final 36). Stage II: 18 patients recruited (final 18). INCLUSION CRITERIA general anesthesia with esophageal monitoring for over 30 min, legs available and able to fit the device and no contraindications to leg heating or compression. The intervention was: Stage I: Investigational prototype thermal compression device (full device group) or intraoperative FAW. Stage II: Device with only a single heating location. Primary outcomes were perioperative temperatures and incidence of IPH. Secondary outcomes were local skin temperature, general and thermal comfort scores and presence of perioperative complications, including blood loss. RESULTS Mean temperatures in the full device group were significantly higher than the FAW group in the pre-operative (36.7 vs 36.4 C, p < 0.001), early intraoperative (36.3 vs 35.9 C, p < 0.001), intraoperative (36.6 vs 36.2 C, p < 0.001) and postoperative periods (36.8 vs 36.5 C, p < 0.001). The incidence of IPH in the device group was also significantly lower (16.7% vs 72.0%, p = 0.001). Thermal comfort scores were significantly higher in the full device group and hypothermia associated wound complications were higher in the FAW group.

We focused on the effects of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) and endovascular mechanical recanalization (EMR) as rescue therapies in major strokes refractory to IVT. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 87 patients (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >20), who did not respond to full-dose IVT due to LAO, was performed based on their endovascular therapy status. IAT was performed as an intraclot infusion of alteplase, and EMR was provided by the Solitaire device? (Covidien, Dubin, Ireland). The recanalization and 3-month outcome rates after IAT/EMR were correlated with a group of patients who were scheduled to receive endovascular treatment but who underwent only IVT. RESULTS We achieved successful recanalization by IAT and EMR in 68.7% and 76.1% of patients, respectively. Despite no significant differences in mortality between IAT and EMR, a trend towards better outcomes after IAT and a statistically significant increase for outcome-modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-3 (45.7%) and mRS 0-2 (34.9%) after EMR was noted when compared with IVT. The degree of recanalization did not correlate with the functional results except for the good-moderate outcome after successful recanalization by EMR.

Methods: 2004 residents of both sexes, aged 8-72 years old, had responded to a home-based questionnaire. SARS-CoV-2 cases were collected from the Greater ABC Region, an industrial region of the S?o Paulo State, Brazil, part of the S?o Paulo Metropolitan Region. With a focus on the Capuava Petrochemical Complex influence area, using the combination of the AERMOD dispersion model with the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) meteorological model (2016), we evaluated the Greater ABC region.

DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro and The Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases from inception to 22 October 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA RCTs evaluating any intervention aiming to prevent future impact of LBP, reporting an outcome measure of LBP intensity and/or disability measured at least 3 months post-randomisation, and the intervention group must be compared with a group that received no intervention/placebo or minimal intervention. Trials restricting recruitment to participants with current LBP were excluded. RESULTS 27 published reports of 25 different trials including a total of 8341 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled results, from three RCTs (612 participants), found moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme can prevent future LBP intensity (mean difference (MD) -4.50; 95% CI -7.26 to -1.74), and from 4 RCTs (471 participants) that an exercise and education programme can prevent future disability due to LBP (MD -6.28; 95% CI -9.51 to -3.06). It is uncertain whether prevention programmes improve future quality of life (QoL) and workability due to the overall low-quality and very low-quality available evidence. CONCLUSIONS This review provides moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme, and a programme combining exercise and education, are effective to reduce future LBP intensity and associated disability.

MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (HRQoL) - PROMIS? 29+2 Profile v2.1 (PROPr) - measured at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include dyspnoea, cognitive function, health utility, physical activity participation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, work status, health and social care resource use, death - measured at three, six and 12 months post-randomisation. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomised to best practice usual care or the REGAIN programme on a 1:1.03 basis using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, performed by minimisation and stratified by age, level of hospital care, and case level mental health symptomatology. Once consent and baseline questionnaires have been completed by the participant online at home, randomisation will be performed automatically by a bespoke web-based system. BLINDING (MASKING): To ensure allocation concealment from both participant and REGAIN practitioner at baseline, randomisation will be performed only after the baseline questionnaires have been completed online at home by the participant. After randomisation has been performed, participants and REGAIN practitioners cannot be blind to group allocation. Follow-up outcome assessments will be completed by participants online at home. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 535 participants will be randomised: 263 to the best-practice usual care arm, and 272 participants to the REGAIN programme arm. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol: Version 3.0 (27th October 2020) Recruitment will begin in December 2020 and is anticipated to complete by September 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN:11466448 , 23rd November 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol Version 3.0 (27th October 2020) is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

Experts are concerned about elevated substance use (SU) given its well-known association with negative emotions, but existing research has not examined SU among mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a critical next step to inform policy and service supports given links between maternal SU and adverse family experiences. Methods: Data were collected online between April 14-28, 2020. Five-hundred and eight mothers (Mage=34.8 years, SD=5.1) with children 0-8 years old participated via the Parenting During the Pandemic study. Mothers self-reported SU change and motivations for using substances, as well as mental health symptoms. Results: Of participating mothers, 54.9% did not change, 39.2% increased, and 5.9% decreased their SU. Findings indicated mothers with an anxiety disorder or elevated anxiety symptoms were more likely to report increased SU during the pandemic. Using substances to cope with anxiety, depression, and boredom, was elevated among mothers self-reporting increased SU during the pandemic versus those reporting no change or a decrease in usage. Using substances to cope with anxiety was a risk factor for increased SU. Conclusions: Many mothers have increased their SU since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight the need to treat maternal anxiety and the importance of teaching mothers coping strategies, other than using substances, to reduce the incidence of increased SU among mothers and its negative sequelae.","output":"Changes in Maternal Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"First, the authors believed that elevated levels of liver injury markers, particularly aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may reflect true hepatic injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, they might not always reliably produce results when they do not specifically bind to the target proteins that their providers designed them for, leading to unreliable research results. While many proposals have been developed to deal with the problem of antibody specificity, it is still challenging to cover the millions of antibodies that are available to researchers. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of automatically generating alerts to users of problematic antibodies by extracting statements about antibody specificity reported in the literature. The extracted alerts can be used to construct an Antibody Watch knowledge base containing supporting statements of problematic antibodies. We developed a deep neural network system and tested its performance with a corpus of more than two thousand articles that reported uses of antibodies. We divided the problem into two tasks. Given an input article, the first task is to identify snippets about antibody specificity and classify if the snippets report that any antibody exhibits non-specificity, and thus is problematic. The second task is to link each of these snippets to one or more antibodies mentioned in the snippet. The experimental evaluation shows that our system can accurately perform the classification task with 0.925 weighted F1-score, linking with 0.962 accuracy, and 0.914 weighted F1 when combined to complete the joint task. We leveraged Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) to precisely identify antibodies linked to the extracted specificity snippets.

As clinical data revealed poor response rates, the need for developing new methods has increased to improve the overall wellbeing of patients with HCC. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence shows that cancer metabolic changes are a key feature of many types of human malignancies. Metabolic reprogramming refers to cancer cells ability to change their metabolism in order to meet the increased energy demand caused by continuous growth, rapid proliferation, and other neoplastic cell characteristics. For these reasons, metabolic pathways may become new therapeutic and chemopreventive targets. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic alterations associated with metformin (MET), an anti-diabetic agent when combined with two antifolate drugs: trimethoprim (TMP) or methotrexate (MTX), and how metabolic changes within the cancer cell may be used to increase cellular death. In this study, single drugs and combinations were investigated using in vitro assays including cytotoxicity assay (MTT), RT-qPCR, annexin V/PI apoptosis assay, scratch wound assay and Seahorse XF analysis, on a human HCC cell line, HepG2. The cytotoxicity assay showed that the IC(50) of MET as single therapy was 44.08 mM that was reduced to 22.73 mM and 29.29 mM when combined with TMP and MTX, respectively. The co-treatment of both drugs increased p53 and Bax apoptotic markers, while decreased the anti-apoptotic marker; Bcl-2. Both combinations increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and halted cancer cell migration when compared to MET alone. Furthermore, both combinations decreased the MET-induced increase in glycolysis, while also inducing mitochondrial damage, altering cancer cell bioenergetics. These findings provide an exciting insight into the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of MET and anti-folates on HepG2 cells, and how in combination, may potentially combat the aggressiveness of HCC.","output":"Effects of Metformin Combined With Antifolates on HepG2 Cell Metabolism and Cellular Proliferation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus of 2019 (nCoV-19) has become a pandemic, affecting over 205 nations with over 7,410,000 confirmed cases which has resulted to over 418,000 deaths worldwide.

However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. Study design RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPA-study) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. Results RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. Conclusions Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.","output":"Clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of rhinovirus infections in early childhood: A comparison between non-hospitalised and hospitalised children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for people worldwide.

Antibody titers, calculated using a standard curve consisting of stepped concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal antibody, correlated closely (p < 0.0001) with titers obtained from a gold-standard PRNT50% assay performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. IMMUNO-COV v2.0 was comprehensively validated using data acquired from 242 assay runs performed over seven days by five analysts, utilizing two separate virus lots, and 176 blood samples. Assay performance was acceptable for clinical use in human serum and plasma based on parameters including linearity, dynamic range, limit of blank and limit of detection, dilutional linearity and parallelism, precision, clinical agreement, matrix equivalence, clinical specificity and sensitivity, and robustness. Sufficient VSV-SARS2-Fluc virus reagent has been banked to test 5 million clinical samples.

METHODS In this study, the process of detecting the virus began with the deployment of a virtual material inside CT images of the lungs of 128 patients. Virtual material is a hypothetical material that can penetrate the healthy regions in the image by performing sequential numerical measurements to interpret images with high data accuracy. The proposed method also provides a segmented image of only the healthy parts of the lung. RESULTS The resulting segmented images, which represent healthy parts of the lung, are classified into six levels of severity. These levels are classified according to physical symptoms. The results of the proposed methodology are compared with those of the radiologists' reports. This comparison revealed that the gold-standard reports correlated with the results of the proposed methodology with a high accuracy rate of 93%.

The reanalysis of all these datasets in a unified approach should help in understanding the molecular basis of COVID-19. This should allow for the identification of COVID-19 biomarkers expressed in patients and the presence of markers specific to disease severity and condition. Aim: In this study, we aim to use the multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify consistently differential expressed genes in different tissues and clinical settings. Materials and Methods: A list of datasets was generated from NCBIs GEO using the GEOmetadb package through R software. Search keywords included SARS-COV-2 and COVID-19. Datasets in human tissues containing more than ten samples were selected for this study. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each dataset were identified.

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed 12 comorbidities within the first tier that increase with the risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including the comorbidities that are common with increasing age (referred to as age-related comorbidities) and other comorbidities. However, the current method compares a population with and without a particular disease (or disorder), which may result in a bias in the results. Thus, comorbidity risks of COVID-19 mortality may be underestimated. Objective: To re-evaluate the mortality data from the US and estimate the odds ratios of death by major comorbidities with COVID-19, we incorporated the control population with no comorbidity reported and assessed the risk of COVID-19 mortality with a comorbidity. Methods: We collected all the comorbidity data from the public health websites of fifty US States and Washington DC (originally accessed on December 2020). The timing of the data collection should minimize bias from the COVID-19 vaccines and new COVID-19 variants. The comorbidity demographic data were extracted from the state public health data made available online. Using the inverse variance random-effects model, we performed a comparative analysis and estimated the odds ratio of deaths by COVID-19 with pre-existing comorbidities. Results: A total of 39,451 COVID-19 deaths were identified from four States that had comorbidity data, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New York. 92.8% of the COVID-19 deaths were associated with a pre-existing comorbidity. The risk of mortality associated with at least one comorbidity combined was 1113 times higher than that with no comorbidity. The comparative analysis identified nine comorbidities with odds ratios of up to 35 times higher than no comorbidities. Of them, the top four comorbidities were: hypertension (odds ratio 34.73; 95% CI 3.63C331.91; p = 0.002), diabetes (odds ratio 20.16; 95% CI 5.55C73.18; p < 0.00001), cardiovascular disease (odds ratio 18.91; 95% CI 2.88C124.38; p = 0.002), and chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 12.34; 95% CI 9.90C15.39; p < 0.00001). Interestingly, lung disease added only a modest increase in risk (odds ratio 6.69; 95% CI 1.06C42.26; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: The aforementioned comorbidities show surprisingly high risks of COVID-19 mortality when compared to the population with no comorbidity. Major comorbidities were enriched with pre-existing comorbidities that are common with increasing age (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension). The COVID-19 deaths were mostly associated with at least one comorbidity, which may be a source of the bias leading to the underestimation of the mortality risks previously reported. We note that the method has limitations stemming primarily from the availability of the data. Taken together, this type of study is useful to approximate the risks, which most likely provide an updated awareness of age-related comorbidities.","output":"Unusually High Risks of COVID-19 Mortality with Age-Related Comorbidities: An Adjusted Meta-Analysis Method to Improve the Risk Assessment of Mortality Using the Comorbid Mortality Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the COVID-19 pandemics impact on US military veterans health, wellbeing, and care engagement. Healthcare systems like VA need additional information about the pandemics biopsychosocial impacts and how a Whole Health approach may help to address them. OBJECTIVE: To examine how the pandemic has affected veterans health, wellbeing, and engagement in the VA Whole Health System of Care. METHOD: We conducted qualitative interviews with 40 veterans at a large multicampus VA healthcare system during the pandemic. Informed by a Whole Health approach, interviews used open-ended questions to holistically explore pandemic impacts on mental and physical health, healthcare access and engagement, social support, coping strategies, and use of VA healthcare and wellness services. Interviews were conducted by telephone, audio-recorded, and analyzed using a matrix-based technique. Interviews were supplemented by an original survey assessing pandemic impacts; descriptive frequencies were calculated to describe and characterize the interviewed sample. INTERVIEW RESULTS: Nearly, all participating veterans described significant pandemic impacts on their wellbeing, especially loneliness and sorrow stemming from isolation and disruptions to ordinary routines. These emotional impactssometimes combined with new constraints on care access and personal mobilitydisrupted veterans health plans and sometimes deterred engagement in both routine and wellness care. Veterans already struggling with chronic mental and physical health conditions and those who experienced transitions or losses during the pandemic described the most severe impacts on their wellbeing. Virtual VA wellness services, especially health coaching and mind-body wellness groups, were a key source of support and connection for those who engaged in them.

We compared acute and arranged hospitalisation and mortality rates in holiday (Anzac Day Monday to Friday) and non-holiday (Anzac Day Saturday or Sunday) years, for mid-week holidays and long weekends; and measured total weekly average acute and arranged hospitalisation counts. RESULTS: Hospitalisation rates were lower in holiday years than non-holiday years (rate ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.96, p<0.001), with fewer arranged admissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.94, p<0.001), but no significant difference for acute admissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00, p=0.087).

Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden. AIMS: This modeling study aimed to quantify potential health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: We adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections from the NZ Treasury. RESULTS: We estimated the potential CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 health-adjusted life years (HALYs) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities would be increased with the per capita health loss for Mori (Indigenous population) estimated to be 3.7 times greater than for non-Mori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people). The estimated additional health system costs ranged between (NZ$303 million [m] to 503m in 2019 values; or US$209m to 346m). CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause significant health loss, increase health inequities from CVD, and impose additional health system costs in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including additional job creation programs and measures directed towards the primary prevention of CVD.","output":"Potential impact of COVID-19 related unemployment on increased cardiovascular disease in a high-income country: Modeling health loss, cost and equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing during the COVID-19 pandemic has been crucial to public health surveillance and clinical care. Supply chain constraintsspanning limitations in testing kits, reagents, pipet tips, and swabs availabilityhave challenged the ability to scale COVID-19 testing. During the early months, sample collection kits shortages constrained planned testing expansions. In response, the University of Vermont Medical Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Vermont Department of Health Laboratory, Aspenti Health, and providers across Vermont including 16 area hospitals partnered to surmount these barriers. The primary objectives were to increase supply availability and manage utilization. Within the first month of Vermonts stay-at-home order, the University of Vermont Medical Center laboratory partnered with College of Medicine to create in-house collection kits, producing 5000 per week. University of Vermont Medical Center reassigned 4 phlebotomists, laboratory educators, and other laboratory staff, who had reduced workloads, to participate (requiring a total of 5.3-7.6 full-time equivalent (FTE) during the period of study). By August, automation at a local commercial laboratory produced 22,000 vials of media in one week (reducing the required personnel by 1.2 FTE). A multisite, cross-institutional approach was used to manage specimen collection kit utilization across Vermont. Hospital laboratory directors, managers, and providers agreed to order only as needed to avoid supply stockpiles and supported operational constraints through ongoing validations and kit assembly. Throughout this pandemic, Vermont has ranked highly in number of tests per million people, demonstrating the value of local collaboration to surmount obstacles during disease outbreaks and the importance of creative allocation of resources to address statewide needs.","output":"All Hands-On Deck and All Decks on Hand: Surmounting Supply Chain Limitations During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Empirical data on the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic remain scarce, especially among patients with chronic pain. We conducted a cross-sectional study matched by season to examine patient-reported health symptoms among patients with chronic pain pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic onset. Survey responses were analyzed from 7535 patients during their initial visit at a tertiary pain clinic between April 2017COctober 2020. Surveys included measures of pain and pain-related physical, emotional, and social function. The post-COVID-19 onset cohort included 1798 initial evaluations, and the control pre-COVID-19 cohort included 5737 initial evaluations. Patients were majority female, White/Caucasian, and middle-aged. The results indicated that pain ratings remained unchanged among patients after the pandemic onset. However, pain catastrophizing scores were elevated when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020. Pain interference, physical function, sleep impairment, and emotional support were improved in the post-COVID-19 cohort. Depression, anxiety, anger, and social isolation remained unchanged. Our findings provide evidence of encouraging resilience among patients seeking treatment for pain conditions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our findings that pain catastrophizing increased when COVID-19 cases peaked in July 2020 suggests that future monitoring and consideration of the impacts of the pandemic on patients pain is warranted.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on patients with chronic pain seeking care at a tertiary pain clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the dependence between extreme returns of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices and the Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX) changes as well as the predictive power of OVX to generate accurate Value at Risk (VaR) forecasts for crude oil.

This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic from June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression, and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = .017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = .032) and education level (P < .001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < .001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing).

However, recent research has serious limitations, such as non-guideline definition of myocardial injury, heterogenicity of troponin sampling or very short-term follow-up. Using data from a large European cohort, we aimed to overcome these pitfalls and adequately characterize myocardial damage in COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and available high-sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. RESULTS: A total of 918 patients (mean age 63.2  15.5 years, 60.1% male) with a median follow-up of 57 (49-63) days were included. Of these, 190 (20.7%) fulfilled strict criteria for myocardial injury (21.1% chronic, 76.8% acute non-ischemic, 2.1% acute ischemic). Time from onset of symptoms to maximum hs-TnI was 11 (7-18) days. Thrombotic and bleeding events, arrhythmias, heart failure, need for mechanical ventilation and death were significantly more prevalent in patients with higher hs-TnI concentrations, even without fulfilling criteria for myocardial injury. hs-TnI was identified as an independent predictor of mortality [HR 2.52 (1.57-4.04) per 5-logarithmic units increment] after adjusting for multiple relevant covariates. CONCLUSION: Elevated hs-TnI is highly prevalent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even mild elevations well below the 99th URL were significantly associated with higher rates of cardiac and non-cardiac complications, and higher mortality. Future research should address the role of serial hs-TnI assessment to improve COVID-19 prognostic stratification and clinical outcomes.","output":"CHARACTERIZATION OF MYOCARDIAL INJURY IN A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The mobility of an individual measured by phone-collected location data has been found to be associated with depression; however, the longitudinal relationships (the temporal direction of relationships) between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility have yet to be fully explored. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the relationships and the direction of the relationships between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility over time. METHODS: Data used in this paper came from a major EU program, called the Remote Assessment of Disease and RelapseCMajor Depressive Disorder, which was conducted in 3 European countries. Depressive symptom severity was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) through mobile phones every 2 weeks. Participants location data were recorded by GPS and network sensors in mobile phones every 10 minutes, and 11 mobility features were extracted from location data for the 2 weeks prior to the PHQ-8 assessment. Dynamic structural equation modeling was used to explore the longitudinal relationships between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility. RESULTS: This study included 2341 PHQ-8 records and corresponding phone-collected location data from 290 participants (age: median 50.0 IQR 34.0, 59.0) years; of whom 215 (74.1%) were female, and 149 (51.4%) were employed. Significant negative correlations were found between depressive symptom severity and phone-measured mobility, and these correlations were more significant at the within-individual level than the between-individual level.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","output":"A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: People from ethnic minority backgrounds living with dementia are more likely to be diagnosed later and have less access to health and social care support than their White counterparts in the United Kingdom (UK). Covid\\\\19 has exacerbated health inequalities and diminished trust from underserved communities in the government and health services. The wider aim of the study was to explore the impact of covid\\\\19 on Black and South\\\\Asian people living with dementia and their carers as well as exploring the experiences of dementia care. The present paper specifically explores their views on trust and mistrust using an ecological model. METHOD: Semi\\\\structured interviews were conducted with 11 family carers and four people living with dementia from South Asian or Black communities living in the community. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. DESIGN: An exploratory qualiative design was used. RESULTS: Four main themes were developed exploring trust at the structural, organisational, community and individual level. At the structural level, participants discussed the inequity of Covid\\\\19, some lack of trust in the UK Government and confusion in its messaging, and the anxiety sometimes leading to curtailment of media usage. At the organisational level, there was some evidence of a perceived lack of person\\\\centred and culturally sensitive care from healthcare professionals, as well as concerns around care homes as places of safety. At the neighbourhood community level, participants discussed both a distrust as well as a strengthening of relationships and, at the individual level, factors such as knowledge of services, identity, and faith influenced their experience of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: People living with dementia need support at all levels and this study highlights how the pandemic impacted each level. Ways to improve trust in the Government and health professionals alongside culturally adapted health messaging should be explored.

Although social media platforms, such as YouTube, can be an inexpensive and effective method of sharing accurate health information, inaccurate and misleading information shared on YouTube can be dangerous for viewers. The confusing nature of data and claims surrounding the benefits of vitamin D, particularly in the prevention or cure of COVID-19, influences both viewers and the general immune boosting commercial interest. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to ascertain how information on vitamin D and COVID-19 was presented on YouTube in 2020. METHODS: YouTube video results for the search terms COVID, coronavirus, and vitamin D were collected and analyzed for content themes and deemed useful or misleading based on the accuracy or inaccuracy of the content. Qualitative content analysis and simple statistical analysis were used to determine the prevalence and frequency of concerning content, such as confusing correlation with causation regarding vitamin D benefits. RESULTS: In total, 77 videos with a combined 10,225,763 views (at the time of data collection) were included in the analysis, with over three-quarters of them containing misleading content about COVID-19 and vitamin D. In addition, 45 (58%) of the 77 videos confused the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19, with 46 (85%) of 54 videos stating that vitamin D has preventative or curative abilities. The major contributors to these videos were medical professionals with YouTube accounts. Vitamin D recommendations that do not align with the current literature were frequently suggested, including taking supplementation higher than the recommended safe dosage or seeking intentional solar UV radiation exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of misinformation is particularly alarming when spread by medical professionals, and existing data suggesting vitamin D has immune-boosting abilities can add to viewer confusion or mistrust in health information.

To date, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been observed only in patients with severe renal insufficiency.The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a prolonged circulation time of GBCAs caused by reduced renal clearance on the long-term retention of Gd in the skin of rats after administration of different GBCAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Renally impaired Han Wistar Rats (5/6-nephrectomized rats) were injected with Omniscan, OptiMARK, Magnevist, or Gadovist. The contrast agents were administered once daily for 5 consecutive days into the tail vein at a dose of 2.5 mmol Gd/kg b.w. Skin biopsies were taken at various time points, and the gadolinium (Gd) concentration was determined by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) over an observation period of 168 days post injection (p.i.). RESULTS Differences in the skin Gd concentrations were observed between the 4 investigated GBCAs. For the nonionic linear compounds, Omniscan and OptiMARK, high Gd concentrations were maintained in the skin over the observation period of up to 168 days p.i. For the ionic linear compound, Magnevist, comparatively lower Gd retention in the skin was observed over time. For the macrocyclic compound, Gadovist, the Gd values in the skin were even lower, and significantly lower than Gd values in the skin in Omniscan and OptiMARK treated animals. CONCLUSION The results of this preclinical study support the use of 5/6-nephrectomized rats as a model for prolonged circulation time of GBCAs as seen in patients with severe renal impairment. Surgically induced severe renal impairment resulted in delayed clearance of the administered GBCAs in the study animals. The highest amount of Gd was observed in the skin after treatment with the nonionic linear GBCAs, whereas the lowest Gd values were observed after treatment with the macrocyclic agent. This suggests that the difference in the Gd values observed in rat skin tissue after treatment with the different GBCAs is caused of a different propensity of the different GBCAs to release Gd in vivo. However, the analytical method used does not distinguish between chelated and unchelated Gd.","output":"Impact of renal impairment on long-term retention of gadolinium in the rodent skin following the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The yield of product (cheese) during the cheese-making process depends on the cutting time of the cheese curd.

Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm widea change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cellsand in one instance in an infected mosquito cellof crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory to the initiation of budding. In areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50C60 nm spherical structures. In a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cultures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation.

The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %). Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3-100 for both tests) and IV (CI95 %: 96.3-100) and 97 % (CI95 %: 91.5-98.9) for test III. Regarding handling, test I obtained the overall highest scores, while test II was considered to have the most convenient components. Of note, users considered all assays, with the exception of test I, to pose a significant risk for contamination by drips or spills. DISCUSSION: Besides some differences in sensitivity and handling, all four AgPOCTs showed acceptable performance in high viral load samples. However, due to the significantly lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, a careful consideration of pro and cons of AgPOCT has to be taken into account before clinical implementation.","output":"Handling and accuracy of four rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 compared to RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Acute confusional state (ACS) in COVID-19 is shown to be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Methods: We assessed the impact of ACS - defined as a documented deterioration of mental status from baseline on the alertness and orientation to time, place, and person - on inpatient mortality and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in inpatient admissions with active COVID-19 infection in a single-center retrospective cohort of inpatient admissions from a designated COVID-19 tertiary care center using an electronic health record system. Furthermore, we developed and validated a neurological history and symptom-based predictive score of developing ACS. Results: Thirty seven out of 245 (15%) patients demonstrated ACS. Nineteen (51%) patients had multifactorial ACS, followed by 11 (30%) patients because of hypoxemia. ACS patients were significantly older (80 [70-85] years vs 50.5 [38-69] years, p < 0.001) and demonstrated more frequent history of dementia (43% vs 9%, p < 0.001) and epilepsy (16% vs 2%, p = 0.001). ACS patients observed significantly higher in-hospital mortality (45.9% vs 1.9%, aOR [adjusted odds ratio]: 15.7, 95% CI = 3.6-68.0, p < 0.001) and need for ICU transfer (64.9% vs 35.1%, aOR: 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-6.1, p = 0.015). In patients who survived hospitalization, ACS was associated with longer hospital stay (6 [3.5-10.5] days vs 3 [2-7] day, p = 0.012) and numerically longer ICU stay (6 [4-10] days vs 3 [2-6] days, p = 0.078). A score to predict ACS demonstrated 75.68% sensitivity and 81.73% specificity at a cutoff of 3. Conclusion: A high prevalence of ACS was found in patients with COVID-19 in our study cohort. Patients with ACS demonstrated increased mortality and need for ICU care.

We aimed to develop and evaluate a fluorescent destination marker (FDM), composed of a resected omental appendix injected with indocyanine green (ICG), for real-time navigation in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer in this pilot study. METHODS This study included ten patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. To prepare FDMs, we laparoscopically harvested omental appendices attached to the colon we planned to resect. The harvested appendices were injected with diluted ICG, and a gauze tag was attached. The FDMs were placed at target intra-abdominal sites with a ligation clip. RESULTS Patient diagnoses included 1 cecal, 2 ascending colon, 3 transverse colon, 2 sigmoid colon, and 2 rectal cancers. No conversion to open surgery was required and no intraoperative complications occurred. We created 12 sets of FDMs, which were placed at a total of 13 sites in abdominal cavities. FDM fluorescence was successfully detected in all cases. Furthermore, FDMs could be detected earlier than the gauze tags at 12 points, and they were detected at the same time at 1 point. CONCLUSIONS All FDMs facilitated laparoscopic surgery by allowing the surgeon to find the tissue to be dissected, particularly in procedures that required the dissection of lymph nodes around middle colic vessels and mobilization of the splenic flexure. FDMs showed potential for guiding the laparoscopic surgeon to a target anatomical destination.

Design: A cross-sectional study aimed at IMSIU medical students in Riyadh. A questionnaire was distributed in April 2021 through WhatsApp to randomly select medical students from all years except preparatory-year students. Results: We collected 301 responses. 41.9% reported not starting any clinical rotations, and 38.5% indicated finishing some clinical rotations. Of the total students surveyed, 49.5% indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced their choice of specialty;48.6% felt that they had discovered new interests, which affected their consideration. In comparison, 40.5 % believed that COVID -19 had limited their ability to explore their considered specialty. A total of 63.1% students were concerned about fulfilling their graduation requirements in a timely manner, and 15.9% thought that they would need an additional year in medical school before applying to residency because of COVID-19. Conclusion: It was found that most of the students did not complete their clinical rotations or electives. Moreover, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced students' perceptions about their specialty choices after graduation. Most of the students surveyed said their intentions had changed from pursuing specialties that required direct contact with patients to those that did not.

Exclusion criteria were <16 years old, pregnancy, acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and acute respiratory failure from an alternative diagnosis to SARS-CoV-2. Early intubation strategy was previously fiercely advocated due to concerns of exceedingly high NIV failure rate in MERS, infection transmission risks and poorer outcomes with delayed intubation.4-6 In a non-SARS-CoV-2 population, the LUNGSAFE study showed higher ICU mortality with NIV use in patients with PaO2/FiO2 <150 mmHg compared with early intubation.6 Data in SARS-CoV-2 are not available.","output":"Ward-based continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objectives of the study are to understand and explore critical feature wavelengths of the obtained near-infrared (NIR) data relating to dianhong black tea quality categories, we propose a multi-variable selection strategy based on the variable space optimization from big to small which is the kernel idea of a variable combination of the improved genetic algorithm (IGA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in this study. A rapid description based on the NIR technology is implemented to assess black tea tenderness and rankings. First, 700 standard samples from dianhong black tea of seven quality classes are scanned using a NIR system. The raw spectra acquired are preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering coupled with standard normal variate transformation (SNV). Then, the multi-variable selection algorithm (IGA-PSO) is applied to compare with the single method (the IGA and PSO) and search the optimal characteristic wavelengths. Finally, the identification models are developed using a decision tree (DT), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and support vector machine (SVM) based on different kernel functions combined with the effective features from the above variables screening paths for the discrimination of black tea quality. The results show that the IGA-PSO-SVM model with a radial basis function achieves the best predictive results with the correct discriminant rate (CDR) of 95.28% based on selected four characteristic variables in the prediction process. The overall results demonstrate that NIR combined with a multi-variable selection method can constitute a potential tool to understand the most important features involved in the evaluation of dianhong black tea quality helping the instrument manufacturers to achieve the development of low-cost and handheld NIR sensors.","output":"Multi-variable selection strategy based on near-infrared spectra for the rapid description of dianhong black tea quality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, Mitchel narrates about her personal experience navigating stereotypes thrust upon her as a high school student.

Methods Using data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health and the population-based multicentre cohort study, all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan who met the national severe criteria were included from January 16 to March 15, 2020. All patients were followed-up from the day of inclusion, noted as Day one (D1), until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Findings Out of 539 COVID-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities.

Due to the global financial crisis, yacht ownership has declined, but demand for such holiday products remained steady, therefore shifting the yachters profile towards younger and less experienced consumers who prefer to charter boats, rather than own one. Boat chartering offers more flexibility to explore different regions from year to year, but this means that significantly more time must be spent planning the route, since local experience is absent. The tourists experience during the initial contemplation and planning phase, taking place weeks or months before an actual trip, and where a broad range of route options needs to be explored, could thus significantly benefit from support given by automated IT tools. Current literature demonstrates a complete lack of research in the development of itinerary recommendation systems in the context of sailing holidays.

Research and observational data provide broad support regarding the importance of effective vaccines, in contrast, debates remain on the timing and priority of booster vaccination under the assumption of resource constraint. This study aims to evaluate the effect of vaccination regimes on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic from the medium-term perspective. We employ a mathematical model to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, thereafter perform simulation on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic up to 3 years. The outcomes imply that in the absence of severe variants of the pathogen, administration of booster vaccination curtails the peak size of total cases and share of severe infections at later waves. Nevertheless, it can be better off by prioritizing the primary doses to unvaccinated individuals when vaccine shortage is challenged. The effects of priority categories are consistent across a broad range of profiles. Increasing the rollout capacity (i.e., administration rate) of doses can render the reproduction number lower than one and hence contain the transmission of pandemic ultimately controlling for other factors. The timing of rollout of primary doses is pivotal in reducing the magnitude of transmission saturation. It is of importance to prioritize the administration of primary vaccination series to vulnerable individuals efficiently and thereafter increment of administration capacity when the supply of vaccine increases over time to scale down the size of an epidemic.","output":"Evaluation of the effects of vaccination regimes on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of an efficacious and affordable vaccine, the current crisis of COVID-19 is likely to be a long drawn one for many developing countries. In Bangladesh, where the entire population is susceptible and strict lockdown has been relaxed (as of May 31(st) 2020) due to concerns over saving livelihoods, the best available resources and capacities in the country have to be mobilized for an integrated and adaptive response strategy. In this paper we argue that a suitable response strategy for a country with highly constrained health system, must consider how response components will be delivered at scale, along with what can be delivered. In order to save maximum number of lives, an optimal strategy will be one that is able to iteratively select the most feasible set of health response and the network of organizations that can deliver most effectively at scale. This might require thinking outside of the conventional vertical network of public health system. Given its history of high-capacity non-government organizations in Bangladesh, it is likely that there are multiple alternative horizontal network options for delivering any set of response interventions. In fact many horizontal networks are already actively engaged in COVID-19 response work. The goal should be to identify and coordinate these networks, create new networks, and embed mechanisms for scaling up what works and scaling down what does not work.

METHOD: A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms.

On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(?/?) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.","output":"CD200 Receptor Controls Sex-Specific TLR7 Responses to Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 crisis affecting the whole world. This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways \\"atypical\\". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life? administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life? is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life?). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life? was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life? has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs.

Single center retrospective analysis of TLE and RALE performed for carcinoma esophagus between January 2015 and September 2018. Propensity score matching was done between the groups for age, gender, BMI, ASA grade, tumor location, neoadjuvant therapy, the extent of surgical resection (Ivor Lewis or McKeowns), histopathological type (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma), clinical T and N stages. The primary outcome parameter was lymph node yield. Secondary outcome parameters were resection margin status, duration of surgery, blood loss, conversion to open procedure, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, complications, 90-day mortality and cost. There were 90 patients in TLE and 25 patients in RALE group. After propensity matching, there were 22 patients in each group. The lymph node yield was similar in both the groups (23.95  8.23 vs 22.73  11.63; p = 0.688). There were no conversions or positive resection margins in either group. RALE was associated with longer operating duration (513.18  91.23 min vs 444.77  64.91 min; p = 0.006) and higher cost ($5271.75  456.46 vs $4243.01  474.64; p < 0.001) than TLE.

Nevertheless, previous studies reported institutional or individual reluctance of departments or anatomists, respectively, due to an expectation of adverse publicity. This study aimed to investigate whether the official websites of Turkish anatomy departments provided information on body donation and analyzed the content of these websites. Websites of anatomy departments at 100 medical faculties were evaluated. Only 12 departments (12%) provided information on body donation with varying content. A thematic analysis of the information provided revealed five main themes. These were (1) legal aspects, (2) significance, (3) acceptance/rejection criteria, (4) availability, and (5) redirection. All departments (n = 12, 100%) outlined the legal aspects of body donation, 7 departments (58%) highlighted the significance of body donation, 7 departments (58%) provided contact information for potential donors, 5 departments (41%) covered acceptance/rejection criteria, and 3 departments (25%) provided a link to the official website of the Turkish Society of Anatomy and Clinical Anatomy. Thus Turkish anatomy departments were reluctant to provide information on body donation, and the content of provided information varied greatly among departments.

Methods Participants aged 18 C 59 y received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, 14 days apart, and a booster dose after 12 m. Blood samples were collected before vaccination (baseline), 1 and 6 m after primary immunization, and at multiple instances within 21 d of booster dose. NAbs against the spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 and three variants were measured using pseudovirus neutralization assays. Results Out of 400 enrolled participants, 387 completed visits scheduled within 6 m of the second dose, and 346 participated received the booster dose in the follow-up research. After 1 m of primary immunization, geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NAbs peaked for Wuhan-Hu-1, while GMTs of other variants were < 30. After 6 m of primary immunization, GMTs of NAbs against all strains were < 30. After 3 d of booster immunization, GMTs were unaltered, seroconversion rates reached approximately 50% after 7 d, and GMTs of NAbs against all strains peaked at 14 d. Conclusion Two-dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine induced the formation of NAbs and memory-associated immune responses, and high titers of NAbs against the variants obtained after booster immunization may further improve the effectiveness of the vaccine.","output":"Evaluation of Immunogenicity by Pseudovirus Neutralization Assays for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Variants after Primary and Booster Immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a pressing need for more sustainable healthcare. UK medical graduates are required to apply social, economic, and environmental principles of sustainability to their practice. The Centre for Sustainable Healthcare has developed a sustainability in quality improvement (SusQI) framework and educators toolkit to address these challenges. We aimed to develop and evaluate SusQI teaching using this toolkit at Bristol Medical School. METHODS: We facilitated a SusQI workshop for all third-year Bristol Medical School students. We used mixed methods including questionnaires, exit interviews and follow-up focus groups to evaluate the outcomes and processes of learning. RESULTS: Students reported: improvements in knowledge, confidence, and attitudes in both sustainable healthcare and quality improvement; increased self-rated likelihood to engage in SusQI projects; and willingness to change practices to reduce environmental impact in their healthcare roles. Factors for successful teaching included: interactivity; collaboration and participation; and real-life, relevant and tangible examples of projects delivered by credible role models. CONCLUSIONS: Students reported that SusQI education supported by the toolkit was effective at building knowledge and skills, and reframed their thinking on sustainability in quality improvement. Combining the two topics provided enhanced motivation for and engagement in both. Further research is needed on the clinical impacts of SusQI learning.

We aimed to explore the reasons behind Australian parents' vaccine intentions for themselves and for their children. METHOD: This mixed methods study relates to Wave 13 (January 2021) of a longitudinal study of Australian parents' experiences during COVID-19 and contained 1094 participants (83% mothers). We used multinomial logistic regression to understand demographic predictors of vaccine intention, and a descriptive template thematic analysis to analyse open-ended questions about parents' reasons for vaccine intentions for themselves and their children. RESULTS: 64% of Australian parents intend on vaccination, 26% are unsure and 9% intend to decline; 48% intend to vaccinate their children, 38% are unsure, and 14% intend to decline. Relative to those intending to vaccinate, parents unsure (OR = -0.63, 95% CI: 0.46, ?0.84, p = .002) or not intending (OR = -0.41, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.67 p < .001) to vaccinate were more likely to have lower trust in doctors. Similar predictors emerged for parents who did not intend to vaccinate their children (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.70, p < .001). Qualitative data indicated that many parents had not made a firm decision, including a lack of alignment between intentions and reasons. For example, parents who said yes to vaccination, often then expressed hesitance and a focus on risks in their written response. Reasons for hesitancy for themselves included concerns about testing, side effects, and long-term outcomes. Similar themes were present for children, but parents expressed a strong desire to protect their children, and an eagerness for health information. CONCLUSION: Based on prior research and the themes identified here, a multipronged campaign that includes education/promotion, good access to vaccines and role models, is likely to support parents to make informed decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Poison or protection?

METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 12) from two universities participate in a yearlong CPDM. In the first semester, undergraduates attend weekly meetings focused on online learning platforms; building community of practice; reviewing learning models, theories, and pedagogy; and building skills to support social and emotional learning. Undergraduates participate in reflective practice throughout the CPDM to advance their teaching skills. In the second semester, undergraduates develop online modules supporting remote instruction for the learner-centered curriculum Teens CAN: Comprehensive Food Literacy in Cooking, Agriculture, and Nutrition. Undergraduates develop virtual lesson procedures and content to be pilot tested with the community of practice. RESULTS: Upon project conclusion, undergraduates will complete a retrospective questionnaire measuring self-efficacy to teach nutrition. They will also participate in an in-depth interview that mirrors the reflective practice, where they reflect on what they gained and wished to change for future CPDM projects. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing strategies from in-person CPDMs in virtual professional development may provide an efficient, effective, and equitable methodology to connect with undergraduate students and improve their self-efficacy to teach while providing training and skills. This virtual methodology may serve two purposes; decreasing attrition in participation by removing barriers such as travel and scheduling, but also enhancing the delivery of nutrition education through utilization of modern technology. Limitations of remote instruction are numerous, but providing opportunities for undergraduates to develop skills in online education has the potential to broaden the reach of health-focused programming delivered by agencies with limited staff during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

We therefore performed a secondary subgroup-analysis of data from an open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial published in 2015 investigating the proanthocyanidin-rich Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 in patients with the common cold. Methods: 120 patients with common cold and at least 2 out of 10 common cold symptoms received one film-coated 20 mg tablet EPs 7630 thrice daily for 10 days in an uncontrolled, interventional multicentre trial (ISRCTN65790556). At baseline, viral nucleic acids were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Common cold-associated symptoms and treatment satisfaction were evaluated after 5 days and at treatment end. Based on the data of patients with proof of viral nucleic acids, we compared the course of the disease in patients with or without HCoV infection. Results: In 61 patients, viral nucleic acids were detected. Of these, 23 (37.7%) were tested positive for at least one HCoV (HCoV subset) and 38 (62.3%) for other viruses only (non-HCoV subset). Patients of both subsets showed a significant improvement of common cold symptoms already after 5 days of treatment, although the observed change tended to be more pronounced in the HCoV subset. At treatment end, more than 80% of patients of both groups were completely recovered or majorly improved. In both subsets, less than 22% of patients took concomitant paracetamol for antipyresis. The mean number of patients days off work or school/college was similar (0.9  2.6 days in HCoV subset vs 1.3  2.8 days in non-HCoV subset). In both groups, most patients were satisfied or very satisfied with EPs 7630 treatment. Conclusion: EPs 7630 treatment outcomes of common cold patients with confirmed HCoV infection were as favourable as in patients with other viral infections. As this trial was conducted before the pandemic, there is currently no evidence from clinical trials for the efficacy of EPs 7630 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In addition to drug resistance, the important causative agent of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)) is able to persist asymptomatically in individuals for many years, causing latent forms of tuberculosis. In such a dormant state, Mtb cells are also resistant to known antibiotics. In this regard, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) could be an effective alternative to antibiotics as its action is based on the generation of active forms of oxygen independently on the presence of specific antibiotic targets, thereby inactivating both drug-resistant and dormant bacteria. In this review, we summarise examples of the application of PDI for the elimination of representatives of the genus Mycobacteria, both in vitro and in vivo. According to published results, including photosensitisers in the PDI regime results in a significantly higher lethal effect. Such experiments were mainly performed using chemically synthesised photosensitisers, which need to be transported to the areas of bacterial infections, limiting PDI usage by surface (skin) diseases. In this regard, endogenous photosensitisers (mainly porphyrins) could be used to solve the problem of transportation. In vitro experiments demonstrate the effective application of PDI for mycobacteria, including Mtb, using endogenous porphyrins; the intracellular contents of these substances can be elevated by administration of 5-aminolevulenic acid, a precursor of porphyrin synthesis. Photodynamic inactivation can also be used for dormant mycobacteria, which are characterised by high levels of endogenous porphyrins. Thus, PDI can effectively eliminate drug-resistant mycobacteria. The exploitation of modern light-transmitting techniques opens new possibilities to use PDI in clinical settings. KEY POINTS: ?The potential effects of photodynamic inactivation of mycobacteria are critically reviewed. ?Approaches to photoinactivation of mycobacteria using exogenous and endogenous photosensitisers are described. ?Prospects for the use of photodynamic inactivation in the treatment of tuberculosis are discussed.","output":"Photoinactivation of mycobacteria to combat infection diseases: current state and perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance There are few data on remote postdischarge treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Objective To compare the safety and efficacy of allied health care practitioner-led remote intensive management (RIM) with cardiologist-led standard care (SC). Design, Setting, and Participants This intention-to-treat feasibility trial randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing early revascularization and with N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration more than 300 pg/mL to RIM or SC across 3 hospitals in Singapore from July 8, 2015, to March 29, 2019. RIM participants underwent 6 months of remote consultations that included -blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACE-I/ARB) dose adjustment by a centralized nurse practitioner team while SC participants were treated face-to-face by their cardiologists. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary safety end point was a composite of hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, or acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization. To assess the efficacy of RIM in dose adjustment of -blockers and ACE-I/ARBs compared with SC, dose intensity scores were derived by converting comparable doses of different -blockers and ACE-I/ARBs to a scale from 0 to 5. The primary efficacy end point was the 6-month indexed left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) adjusted for baseline LVESV. Results Of 301 participants, 149 (49.5%) were randomized to RIM and 152 (50.5%) to SC. RIM and SC participants had similar mean (SD) age (55.3 [8.5] vs 54.7 [9.1] years), median (interquartile range) N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (807 [524-1360] vs 819 [485-1320] pg/mL), mean (SD) baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (57.4% [11.1%] vs 58.1% [10.3%]), and mean (SD) indexed LVESV (32.4 [14.1] vs 30.6 [11.7] mL/m2); 15 patients [5.9%] had a left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. The primary safety end point occurred in 0 RIM vs 2 SC participants (1.4%) (P = .50). The mean -blocker and ACE-I/ARB dose intensity score at 6 months was 3.03 vs 2.91 (adjusted mean difference, 0.12 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.26; P = .10]) and 2.96 vs 2.77 (adjusted mean difference, 0.19 [95% CI, -0.02 to 0.40; P = .07]), respectively. The 6-month indexed LVESV was 28.9 vs 29.7 mL/m2 (adjusted mean difference, -0.80 mL/m2 [95% CI, -3.20 to 1.60; P = .51]). Conclusions and Relevance Among low-risk patients with revascularization after myocardial infarction, RIM by allied health care professionals was feasible and safe.

Objective: We developed and validated a fit-for-purpose, disease-specific instrument to assess symptoms in patients with COVID-19 to inform endpoints in an interventional trial for non-hospitalized patients. Design: The initial drafting of the 23-item Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) Instrument was developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptom list and available published literature specific to patients with COVID-19 as of Spring 2020. The measurement principles in the Food and Drug Administration patient-reported outcomes guidance and the four methodological Patient-Focused Drug Development Guidances were also considered. Setting: Interviews were conducted virtually with patients recruited through a healthcare research firm. Participants: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 Intervention: Interviews involved two stages: (1) concept elicitation, to obtain information about the symptoms experienced as a result of COVID-19 in patients' own words, and (2) cognitive debriefing, for patients to describe their understanding of the SE-C19 instructions, specific symptoms, response options, and recall period to ensure the content of the SE-C19 is relevant and comprehensive. Five clinicians treating COVID-19 outpatients were interviewed to obtain their insights on symptoms experienced by patients and provide input on the SE-C19. Main Outcome and Measure: Patients reported no issues regarding the relevance or appropriateness of the SE-C19 instructions, including the recall period. The comprehensiveness of the SE-C19 was confirmed against the conceptual model developed in the qualitative research. Minor conceptual gaps were revealed to capture nuances in the experience of nasal and gustatory symptoms, and systemic manifestations of sickness.

However, recent studies and analysis have also emphasized the importance of understanding the negative aspects of ESMs use. By applying uses and gratifications theory (UGT), this study proposes a research model that tests how employees ESM usage (hedonic, social, and information values) leads to ESM-related strain through perceived information overload. The study collected data from 315 Chinese employees using a survey method and analyzed the results using AMOS 21.0 software. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the proposed hypothesis. The results indicate that perceived hedonic, social, and information values are significant predictors of perceived information overload. Such overload is also significantly associated with ESM-related strain. The results also indicate that ESM visibility strengthens the significant relationship between perceived information overload and ESM-related strain. Furthermore, managers can also train individuals to use ESM appropriately. We recommend that employees can better control and manage their ESM usage by recognizing the causes of excessive use.","output":"Investigating the factors of enterprise social media strain: The role of enterprise social medias visibility as a moderator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3a), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage &#8805; 2/rectal cancer T stage &#8805; 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.","output":"[Treatment strategy for gastrointestinal tumor under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 by clarifying the clinical characteristics and immune responses.

RESULTS: This study included 836 patients with confirmed COVID-19. In total, 699 (83.6%) were cured and discharged, and 137 (16.4%) died. Our analysis revealed that age  65 years, male sex, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, dizziness, respiratory rate > 20 bpm, heart rate > 100 bpm, systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, neutrophils > 6.3109/L, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, D-dimer  0.5 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase > 250 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase > 40 U/L, total bilirubin > 26 mol/L, albumin < 35 g/L, blood urea nitrogen > 9.5 mmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73, elevated cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide  900 pg/ml, C-reactive protein  25 mg/L, procalcitonin  0.05 ng/ml and ferritin > 400 g/L were associated with death in patients with COVID-19. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73, elevated cardiac troponin I, C-reactive protein  25 mg/L and procalcitonin  0.05 ng/ml were predictive of mortality. Regarding immune responses, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF were remarkably higher in the deceased group at admission, and the levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF in the deceased group showed a rapid increase; the dynamics of these cytokines were highly consistent with disease deterioration. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed that the deceased patients showed significant decreases in lymphocyte counts, especially helper T cells, suppressor T cells and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 ml/min/1.73, elevated cardiac troponin I, C-reactive protein  25 mg/L and procalcitonin  0.05 ng/ml were predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients.

It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging.","output":"Mechanistic Analysis of Age-Related Clinical Manifestations in Down Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient empowerment is seen as the capability to understand health information and make decisions based on it.

Cognitive training targeting these capacities results in improved cognitive function and mood, demonstrating the relationship between cognition and affect, and shedding light on novel targets for cognitive-focused interventions. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is one such new intervention, with evidence suggesting it may be effective as an adjunct treatment for depression. Parallel research suggests that mindfulness training improves depression via enhanced ER and augmentation of self-referential processes. CCT and mindfulness training both act on anti-correlated neural networks involved in EF and ER that are often dysregulated in depressionthe cognitive control network (CCN) and default-mode network (DMN). After practicing CCT or mindfulness, downregulation of DMN activity and upregulation of CCN activity have been observed, associated with improvements in depression and cognition. As CCT is posited to improve depression via enhanced cognitive function and mindfulness via enhanced ER ability, the combination of both forms of training into mindfulness-enhanced CCT (MCCT) may act to improve depression more rapidly. MCCT is a biologically plausible adjunct intervention and theoretical model with the potential to further elucidate and target the causal mechanisms implicated in depressive symptomatology.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent robotic single-port transumbilical total hysterectomy between January 2010 and July 2010. All surgical procedures were performed through a single 3-4-cm umbilical incision, with a multi-channel system consisting of a wound retractor, a surgical glove, and two 10/12-mm and two 8 mm trocars. RESULTS Seven patients were treated with robotic single-port transumbilical total hysterectomy. Procedures included total hysterectomy due to benign gynecological disease (n=5), extra-fascial hysterectomy due to carcinoma in situ of the cervix (n=1), and radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer IB1 (n=1). The median total operative time was 109 minutes (range, 105 to 311 minutes), the median blood loss was 100 mL (range, 10 to 750 mL), and the median weight of the resected uteri was 200 g (range, 40 to 310 g).

Patients are increasingly using physician online reviews (PORs) to learn about the quality of care. Patients benefit from the use of PORs and physicians need to be aware of how this evaluation affects their treatment decisions. The current work aims to investigate the influence of critical quantitative and qualitative factors on physician review helpfulness (RH). (2) Methods. The data including 45,300 PORs across multiple disease types were scraped from Healthgrades.com. Grounded on the signaling theory, machine learning-based mixed methods approaches (i.e., text mining and econometric analyses) were performed to test study hypotheses and address the research questions. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify the data set with review- and service-related features through a confusion matrix. (3) Results. Regarding review-related signals, RH is primarily influenced by review readability, wordiness, and specific emotions (positive and negative). With regard to service-related signals, the results imply that service quality and popularity are critical to RH. Moreover, review wordiness, service quality, and popularity are better predictors for perceived RH for serious diseases than they are for mild diseases. (4) Conclusions. The findings of the empirical investigation suggest that platform designers should design a recommendation system that reduces search time and cognitive processing costs in order to assist patients in making their treatment decisions. This study also discloses the point that reviews and service-related signals influence physician RH. Using the machine learning-based sentic computing framework, the findings advance our understanding of the important role of discrete emotions in determining perceived RH.

This novel coronavirus, caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-), is described as highly infectious. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavirus as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, and declared it as a pandemic. Almost all countries have undertaken wide-scale precautions so as to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, with most having practiced some form of lockdown along with social distancing, as well as dispensed recommendations for proper hand washing, avoiding touching the face, wearing facemasks, and using disposable tissues when either coughing or sneezing. Whereas it is well known that slowing the spread of this new epidemic requires the cooperation of all citizens, some people still seem to willfully disregard the rules and guidelines, and thereby ignore the health risks posed to both themselves and to others they come into contact with. People have responded differently to lockdown rules and social distancing practices. Whilst the majority follow the rules and recommendations with great care, others are more lax or simply refuse to comply. These differences might be accounted for according to a number of factors including personal, social, cultural, mental, and economic variables. Being persuaded to comply with preventive rules, especially those concerned with health-related behaviors, also bring certain other factors into play. Fear is one of those factors, and is one of the most powerful. It is well known that fear-based appeals can be effective in inculcating health behaviors, with many theories having been developed in this area. However, both the content of the message (the level of the fear it contains) and certain personal variables can determine the persuasive power of the fear appeal. It can even have an adverse effect if not properly applied. Many theories have been developed to address the persuasive effectiveness of the fear appeal (e.g., fear-drive theory, protection-motivation theory), and this study aims to discuss these individual differences in precautionary and preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic within the framework of the basic assumptions of these theoretical approaches.","output":"Accepting Restrictions and Compliance With Recommended Preventive Behaviors for COVID-19: A Discussion Based on the Key Approaches and Current Research on Fear Appeals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current situation of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline workers are trying hard with maximum possible efforts to lessen the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with the help of available resources Due to existing shortages of the Personal Protective Equipments (PPE) more frequently facemasks and respirators, the rational use of these PPEs and their prioritisation becomes absolutely necessary Other measures such as the use of respirators beyond their shelf-life, extended usage, limited reuse of respirators and decontamination, reprocessing and re-use of respirators have to be considered This review article focused on the current situation of shortage of masks, rational use of various types of respiratory protective devices, mask use in laboratories and different methods of decontamination and reprocessing of the respirators Intense literature search of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Influenza pandemic 2009 were done and various guidelines inclusive of Centre for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), World Health Organisation (WHO), Public health agency of Canada were adapted for this review","output":"Intelligent Use of Mask in the View of Extraordinary Shortage Situation of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a telerehabilitation program during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adult patients with physical disabilities.

Autistic and non-autistic researchers spoke to 144 people, including 44 autistic adults, 84 parents of autistic children and 16 autistic young people (12-18 years old). We asked them about their everyday lives and mental health during lockdown. People told us that they enjoyed having fewer obligations and demands compared to pre-COVID-19 life. They felt that life was quieter and calmer. But people also told us again and again how much they missed meeting people in real life, especially their friends, and their therapists and support workers. People told us that their mental health suffered because they did not have contact with their friends and services. Importantly, many people (including researchers) think that autistic people do not want friends or to be around people. But our results show that is not true. Many autistic people do want friends and to be around other people. Some people's mental health has been damaged by not being able to see people during COVID-19. Autistic people need support in many areas of life so they can keep socialising and seeing their friends even through difficult times, like pandemics.","output":"COVID-19, social isolation and the mental health of autistic people and their families: A qualitative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 crisis is likely to have had wide-ranging consequences on lifestyle behaviours and may have affected weight management. The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight-related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: As part of an online cross-sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well-being. Results: Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI]  30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. Conclusions: Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased risk.","output":"Weight-related lifestyle behaviours and the COVID-19 crisis: An online survey study of UK adults during social lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic value of the rtRT-PCR test and CT in patients presenting with typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19 Methods: The study with the participation of four center in Turkey was performed retrospectively from 20 March-15 April 2020 in 203 patients confirmed for COVID-19 The initial rtRT-PCR test was positive in 142(70 0%) of the patients(Group-I) and negative in 61 patients(Group-II) Results: The mean age of the patients in Group-I was 49 718 0 years and the time between the onset of symptoms and admission to the hospital was 3 62 0 days;whereas the same values for the patients in Group-II were 58 119 9 and 5 34 2, respectively(p=0 004;p=0 026) Initial rtRT-PCR was found positive with 83 5% sensitivity and 74 1% PPV in patients with symptom duration of less than five days It was found that rtRT-PCR positivity correlated negatively with the presence of CT findings, age, comorbidity, shortness of breath, and symptom duration, while rtRT-PCR positivity correlated positively with headache Presence of CT findings was positively correlated with age, comorbidity, shortness of breath, fever, and the symptom duration Conclusions: It should be noted that a negative result in the rtRT-PCR test does not rule out the possibility of COVID-19 diagnosis in patients whose symptom duration is longer than five days, who are elderly with comorbidities and in particular who present with fever and shortness of breath In these patients, typical CT findings are diagnostic for COVID-19 A normal chest CT is no reason to loosen up measures of isolation in patients with newly beginning symptoms until the results are obtained from the PCR test","output":"Diagnostic value of Chest CT and Initial Real-Time RT-PCR in COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & Aims: Knowledge-based businesses active in the medical and health innovative ecosystem play an important role in inhibiting the Covid-19 virus outbreak crisis The current study deals with extracting and analyzing the key aspects of medical innovative eco-system and the role of innovative intermediaries in supporting the development of these businesses Materials & Methods: In terms of purpose, this study is developmental - applied, in terms of data collection, it is descriptive and survey and in terms of the origin of collected data, it is a mixed study (both quantitative and qualitative) The research tool for quantitative data collection was interview and qualitative data collection tool was a questionnaire created by the researchers themselves In qualitative part, data-based method with the Glaserian approach (emergent and spontaneous) was used and in qualitative part structural equations and SMART-PLS3 software were used The population of this study was faculty members of university of medical science (as experts) and CEOs and personnel of knowledge-based and technology-based companies that are active in medical innovative eco-system of Western Azerbaijan province, from which a sample of 162 subjects was chosen on the basis of Cochran formula","output":"Investigating the impact of knowledge-based business development in medical and health innovative ecosystem on inhibiting the COVID-19 virus outbreak crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service Members and military beneficiaries face complex and ill-structured challenges, including suicide, sexual violence, increasing health care costs, and the evolving coronavirus pandemic. Military and other government practitioners must identify effective programs, policies, and initiatives to preserve the health and ensure the readiness of our Force. Both research and program evaluation are critical to identify interventions best positioned to prevent disease, protect the public's health, and promote health and well-being within our ranks to retain a medically ready force and reduce the global burden of disease. While military and medical leaders are typically well versed in research and understand the role of research in evidence-informed decisions, they may be less aware of program evaluation. Program evaluation is the systematic application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program, policy, or initiative. Although program evaluators commonly utilize scientific or research methods to answer evaluation questions, evaluation ultimately differs from research in its intent. Several recently published federal and Department of Defense policies specifically reference program evaluation, emphasizing its importance to the military and government as a whole. The Army is uniquely positioned to conduct medical and public health evaluation activities and there are several Army organizations and entities that routinely perform this work. For example, the United States Army Public Health Center (APHC) is among recognized military experts in public health assessment and program evaluation. Given the breadth of our work, the APHC understands the challenges to conducting evaluation studies in the Army and we have thoughtfully examined the conditions common to successful evaluation studies. In this commentary, we share our lessons learned to assist military colleagues, potential partners, and others in successfully evaluating the programs, policies, and initiatives necessary to keep our Service Members and beneficiaries healthy and ready. There are several challenges to executing evaluation studies in the Army that may be relevant across all Services. These include but are not limited to frequent Army leadership transitions, urgency to report study results, lack of program documentation and adequate planning for evaluation, expectation management to ensure stakeholders are well-informed about the evaluation process, and a disorganized data landscape. These challenges may hinder the successful execution of evaluation studies, or prevent them from being attempted in the first place, depriving Army leaders of quality, actionable information to make evidence-informed decisions. Despite the aforementioned challenges, we have identified a number of best practices to overcome these challenges and conduct successful evaluation studies. These facilitators of successful evaluations can be summarized as: collaboration with engaged stakeholders who understand the value of evaluation, evaluation studies aligned with larger strategic priorities, agile methodology, thoughtful evaluation planning, and effective communication with stakeholders. We wholeheartedly recommend and encourage program evaluation at every opportunity, and we anticipate the call for evaluation and evidence-informed decisions to continually increase. Our hope is that others - to include partners and stakeholders within and external to the military - will be able to leverage and apply this information, especially the identified best practices, in their evaluation efforts to ensure success.","output":"The Role of Program Evaluation in Keeping Army Health \\"Army Strong\\": Translating Lessons Learned Into Best Practices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observational studies are needed to demonstrate real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outcomes.

The utility of such tasks arises from the complex interaction of linguistic demands (word retrieval, sentence formulation, articulation). However, this complexity also makes spontaneous speech hugely variable and difficult to assess. The current study aimed to simplify the problem by identifying latent factors underlying performance in spontaneous speech in aphasia. The ecological validity of the factors was examined by examining how well the factor structures corresponded to traditionally defined aphasia subtypes. Method A factor analysis was conducted on 17 microlinguistic measures of narratives from 274 individuals with aphasia in AphasiaBank. The resulting factor scores were compared across aphasia subtypes. Supervised (linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (latent profile analysis) classification techniques were then conducted on the factor scores and the solutions compared to traditional aphasia subtypes. Results Six factors were identified. Two reflected aspects of fluency, one at the phrase level (Phrase Building) and one at the narrative level (Narrative Productivity). Two other factors reflected the accuracy of productions, one at the word level (Semantic Anomaly) and one at the utterance level (Grammatical Error). The other two factors reflected the complexity of sentence structures (Grammatical Complexity) and the use of repair behaviors (Repair), respectively. Linear discriminant analyses showed that only about two thirds of speakers were classified correctly and that misclassifications were similar to disagreements between clinical diagnoses. The most accurately diagnosed syndromes were the largest groups-Broca's and anomic aphasia. The latent profile analysis also generated profiles similar to Broca's and anomic aphasia but separated some subtypes according to severity. Conclusions The factor solution and the classification analyses reflected broad patterns of spontaneous speech performance in a large and representative sample of individuals with aphasia. However, such data-driven approaches present a simplified picture of aphasia patterns, much as traditional syndrome categories do. To ensure ecological validity, a hybrid approach is recommended, balancing population-level analyses with examination of performance at the level of theoretically specified subgroups or individuals.

Value should be measured by outcomes achieved, relevant for patients. Patient-centeredness is one domain for quality improvement determined by the Institute of Medicine, aiming to deliver care responsive to the patient. The development and implementation of patient reported outcome- and experience measures can be used for this goal. Recently, we developed the Patient Reported Measure (PRM)-acute care, based on five relevant domains to evaluate and improve the quality of care in the Emergency Department (ED). OBJECTIVE: To validate the PRM-acute care, in order to evaluate and improve patient-centered care in the ED. METHODS: We performed a prospective questionnaire-based study. Patients 18 years presenting for internal medicine in the ED were eligible. The validity of the PRM-acute care was evaluated according to the COSMIN-criteria. We performed hypotheses testing to evaluate construct validity. The perceived quality of care was evaluated by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Face- and content validity was evaluated based on previously performed research and deemed good. Construct validity was supported by demonstrated differences between subgroups; patients with severe symptoms had a higher perceived quality of care. The correlation between overall satisfaction and the total mean score of the PRM-acute care (r = 0,447, p = 0.01) was significant. Overall, patients reported a mean perceived quality of care of 4.67/6.0. CONCLUSION: The PRM-acute care is a valid instrument to measure the perceived quality of care in an acute setting for internal medicine patients. Additionally, patients reported a good perceived quality of care in the ED with scores ranging from moderate to well for each of the relevant domains. Therefore, we believe that the PRM-acute care can be implemented in daily practice to evaluate the perceived quality of care and to improve the quality of acute care.","output":"Quality of acute internal medicine: A patient-centered approach.

No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. METHODS: The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by the ongoing RCTs.

We performed endoscopic resection and histopathological analysis of all resected lesions within 3 months after CCE2. We considered the optical colonoscopy (OC) findings as the gold standard and evaluated CCE2 sensitivity. RESULTS Sixty-seven lesions (6 mm) were detected via OC, with 27 colorectal superficial lesions and 40 protruded lesions. CCE2 sensitivity for 6-mm-sized, superficial, and protruded lesions was 84, 78, and 88%, respectively. No significant intergroup differences were observed. CCE2 false-negative colorectal superficial lesions accounted for 31% of right-sided colon lesions and 50% of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps). The CCE2 false-negative protruded lesions accounted for 17% of right-sided colon lesions.

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations. RESULTS: The study included 541 patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD. The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%). Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p<0.05). Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026). Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p<0.05). The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%).

The workforce found reassurance from understanding what was not expected of them, as much as what was. For example, making clear that Arterial Blood Gases would not be introduced to the psychiatric setting. There is an ongoing learning need for physical health training through SBE in non-covid scenarios. SBE can be an effective intervention for a range of medical grades and covering a large geographical area. There are opportunities for developing multi-disciplinary training on physical health in psychiatry. Conclusion We have outlined some of the key learning outcomes from a successfully implemented SBE project during the first COVID-19 wave in spring 2020. The project has cemented the role of the relatively new simulation faculty within the trust and highlighted the effectiveness of close collaboration between leadership and a small, dedicated group of facilitators. The project has continued to be used for training new staff members and the resources have been widely shared, used by other NHS trusts and also internationally.","output":"Responding to a pandemic with Simulation Based Education (SBE)?

The annual concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 m (PM(10)), ranging from 141 to 166 g m(? 3) in 2000C2004, could be very harmful to human health. In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM(10) pollution based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposureCresponse function. The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing's gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM(2.5) pollution in Beijing to protect public health. The Beijing government also needs to cooperate with the other local governments to reduce high background level of particulate air pollution.","output":"A health-based assessment of particulate air pollution in urban areas of Beijing in 2000C2004"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented number of adults receiving non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) with such patients having a high mortality rate.MethodsAs part of better elucidating the challenges of end of life care delivery in the COVID era, we conducted an audit of our respiratory HDU ward at Whipps Cross Hospital focusing on a 19-week period between 17/09/2020C30/01/2021 and on patients who did not survive their admission. We excluded patients that were transferred to ITU.ResultsOf a total of 309 patients receiving NIRS on our ward, 84 died during that time at a mean age of 77 (95% CI 67C87) and median of 79 years. 63 patients received CPAP, 67 received HFNT and 42 were first started on HFNT and converted to CPAP. The average length of stay was 10 days (4C16). The mean day of symptoms on presentation to hospital was 11.5 days (1.7C21.3). Average duration of symptoms prior to admission to our ward was 19.7 (9.1C30.3) days.One death was unexpected and followed a cardiac arrest. The most common indicator for a patient approaching end-of-life was hypoxia on NIRS, which was documented in 36 (43%) patients, followed by terminal agitation in 27 (32%) patients. The average time between recognising end-of-life and death was 1.4 days with a median of 2 days. 72 (86%) patients were weaned off NIRS and those who continued did so due to a medical or patient decision. Despite the vast majority (82% of patients) being on syringe drivers with an opiate and benzodiazepine most patients had persistent terminal symptoms: 51 (74%) had agitation and 38 (55%) were persistently breathlessness. Interestingly, no patient opted to rest in the prone position.DiscussionThis data primarily suggests the challenging nature of managing end-of-life care for COVID patients deteriorating on NIRS due to the high symptom load and the short time there is to achieve comfort for these individuals. Clinicians need to conduct frequent comfort reviews for such patients, consider subcutaneous infusions, as well as potentially an increase in medication doses, in conjunction with specialist palliative care input, in order to achieve comfort.","output":"Challenges with end-of-life care in COVID patients requiring non-invasive respiratory support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A fetal bronchogenic cyst (BC) is a rare congenital anomaly with an incidence of 0.147C0.238. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as a particular situation, hindered pregnant women from receiving periodic prenatal checkups. Case Description: Until 34(+6) weeks of gestation, a fetal case of the intrathoracic cyst was found by ultrasound examination. Further, MRI examination confirmed the diagnosis of the congenital mediastinal cystic lesion, probably a BC. Genetic testing was not conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At 38(+5) weeks of gestation with maternal COVID-19 testing negative, a live girl was delivered by cesarean section. Five months later, the child underwent bronchocystectomy, and the postoperative pathological lesions confirmed a (right upper mediastinum) BC. Conclusion: Herein, we reported the prenatal and postnatal management for a rare case of the congenital BC by multidisciplinary approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fetal MRI and screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities are especially recommended. This case contributes to the awareness that the COVID-19 pandemic interferes with regular follow-up schedules during pregnancy and may interfere with timely performed additional tests; which leads to more accurate genetic counseling. A combination of multidisciplinary approaches, including radiology, infection control, genetic counseling, obstetrics, and pediatric surgery, is pivotal for managing fetal BC during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Case Report: Prenatal and Postnatal Management for Fetal Bronchogenic Cysts During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has been associated with several disease complexes, including reproductive failure. The aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of S?o Paulo, Brazil and to investigate co-infections with other infectious organisms. FINDINGS: Samples of 168 aborted foetuses or mummified foetuses from five farrow-to-finish swine farms known to be infected with PCV2 and located in the State of S?o Paulo were tested for PCV2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive samples were additionally tested for porcine parvovirus (PPV), Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. by PCR. PCV2 was detected in 18 of the samples (10.7%). PPV, Brucella spp. and Leptospira spp were found in 2, 10 and 0 cases, respectively. Eleven PCV2 strains were sequenced and determined to be either genotype 2a (n = 1) or 2b (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the frequency of PCV2 infections in aborted porcine foetuses from the State of S?o Paulo is rather low (10.7%) and that co-infection with other pathogens is common and may be involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure.

This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19. This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway. What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected. These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but the management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients. In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients. The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology. Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations.

Machine-learning-based modeling may provide the personalized prediction of the risk of sICH after stroke thrombolysis. Methods We identified 2578 thrombolysis-treated ischemic stroke patients between January 2013 and December 2016 from a multicenter database, where 70% were used to train models and the remaining 30% were used as the nominal test sets. Another 136 consecutive tissue plasminogen-activated-treated patients between January 2017 and December 2017 from our institute were enrolled as the independent test sets for clinical usability evaluation. Five machine-learning models were developed to predict the risk of sICH after stroke thrombolysis, and the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) was used to compare the prediction performance. Results In total, 2237 cases were included in our study, of which 102 had sICH transformation (4.56%). Finally, the three-layer neuro network was selected with the best performance on nominal test sets (AUC = 0.82). The probability of the model score was further categorized into three risk ranks (18.97%, 5.63%, and 0.81%) according to the risk distribution. Implementing our system in clinical practice was associated with reduced computed tomography (CT)-to-treatment time (CTT; 41 min versus 52 min, p < 0.001). All sICH patients were correctly predicted to be within the high-sICH risk rank. Conclusions The machine-learning-based modeling is feasible for providing personalized risk prediction of sICH after stroke thrombolysis, and is able to reduce the CTT.

At the beginning of the outbreak there were no treatments or vaccines that had been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing EVD, limiting health care providers to offer supportive care under extremely challenging circumstances and at great risk to themselves. Over time, however, drugs and vaccines in the development pipeline were prioritized based on all available research data and were moved forward for evaluation in clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. The armamentarium against EVD eventually included biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccines as well as small molecule therapeutics such as small interfering RNAs and nucleoside analogs.

Background The MODS caused by an excessive systemic inflammatory response following trauma is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. The protein BTK is known to play a role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a key component of the innate inflammatory response. However, its role in trauma-hemorrhage is unknown. Methods Acute and chronic HS rat models were performed to determine the influence of acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib on MODS. The activation of BTK, NF-B and NLRP3 pathways were analyzed by western blot in the kidney. Results We demonstrated that (a) HS caused organ injury and/or dysfunction and hypotension (post resuscitation) in rats, while (b) treatment of HS-rats with either acalabrutinib or fenebrutinib attenuated the organ injury and dysfunction in acute and chronic HS models and (c) reduced the activation of BTK, NF-B and NLRP3 pathways in the kidney.

Data from the 14 days before lockdown were compared with data from the last 14 days after 8 weeks of lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 307 patients were included (age 45.8  12.6 years, 50.2% male, diabetes duration 21.1  12.3 years). Only one patient had COVID-19 infection.

While much attention has been paid to health workers in critical care and acute areas, nurses working outside of hospitals are also significantly affected. This study sought to investigate the experience of nurses working in Australian primary healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it sought to understand the implications on their employment status, role, and access to personal protective equipment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nurses employed in primary healthcare across Australia were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey through social media and professional organizations. The survey tool was composed of demographics, and of questions about the nurses' employment, work role, and access to personal protective equipment. FINDINGS: Of the 637 responses received, nearly half (43.7%) reported a decrease in hours and threatened or actual loss of employment. While most respondents felt that they had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19, they expressed concern about work-related risks to themselves and their family. Most respondents described never or only sometimes having sufficient personal protective equipment in their workplace. Just over half of respondents (54.8%) felt well supported by their employer. A third of respondents (34%) perceived that care provided in their workplace was significantly or slightly worse than before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of primary healthcare nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings highlighted a concerning level of insecurity around primary healthcare nursing employment, as well as issues with the availability of personal protective equipment for these nurses. The perception that the pandemic has resulted in reduced quality of care needs further exploration to ensure that those with chronic conditions are supported to maintain and promote health.

Although compression bandaging is the principal treatment, it is time-consuming and bandage application requires specific training. There is evidence that intervention on superficial venous incompetence can help ulcer healing and recurrence, but this is not accessible to all patients. Hence, new treatments are required to address these chronic wounds. One possible adjuvant treatment for VLU is human decellularised dermis (DCD), a type of skin graft derived from skin from deceased tissue donors. Although DCD has the potential to promote ulcer healing, there is a paucity of data for its use in patients with VLU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. One hundred and ninety-six patients with VLU will be randomly assigned to receive either the DCD allograft in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 weeks post-randomisation in each treatment arm. Secondary outcomes include the time to index ulcer healing and the proportion of participants with a healed index ulcer at 12 months. Changes in quality of life scores and cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. A mixed-effects, logistic regression on the outcome of the proportion of those with the index ulcer healed at 12 weeks will be performed.

Our aim is to describe our experience of using a variety of creative communication tools, reflect on their use in different situations, enhance learning and generate discussion within the systematic review community. METHODS: Over the last 5 years, we have explored several creative communication tools within the systematic review process and beyond to extend dissemination beyond traditional academic mechanisms. Central to our approach is the co-production of a communication plan with potential evidence users which facilitates (i) the identification of key messages for different audiences, (ii) discussion of appropriate tools to communicate key messages and (iii) exploration of avenues to share them. We aim to involve evidence users in the production of a variety of outputs for each research project cognisant of the many ways in which individuals engage with information. RESULTS: Our experience has allowed us to develop an understanding of the benefits and challenges of a wide range of creative communication tools. For example, board games can be a fun way of learning, may flatten power hierarchies between researchers and research users and enable sharing of large amounts of complex information in a thought provoking way, but they are time and resource intensive both to produce and to engage with. Conversely, social media shareable content can be quick and easy to produce and to engage with but limited in the depth and complexity of shareable information.

STUDY DESIGN Women scheduled for laparotomic myomectomy with intramural and/or subserous myomas of >60mm in diameter, and who wished to preserve fertility, were eligible. Patients were randomized immediately prior to abdominal wall closure to receive either hydrophilic resorbable film applied directly to the incisions (P-Group, n=33) or 500mL Ringer's lactate solution instilled into the pelvic cavity (R-Group, n=28). Incidence, severity, and extent of postoperative adhesions to the uterine incisions and adnexal and abdominopelvic adhesions were assessed during second-look laparoscopy 10-20 weeks after the initial surgery. Unedited videotapes of this second-look procedure were reviewed by two blinded independent surgeons. RESULTS Fifty-four patients (P-Group, n=28; R-Group, n=26) underwent second-look laparoscopy. Significantly fewer P-Group patients developed adhesions to uterine incisions than R-Group patients (43% vs. 92%, P=0.001). Adhesions, which were confirmed by independent reviewers, were found in significantly fewer P-Group sites than R-Group sites (29% vs. 76%, P=0.001). No serious adverse events related to the barriers used or adhesion-related complications were reported in either group. CONCLUSION The hydrophilic resorbable anti-adhesion film PREVADH? significantly reduced adhesion incidence and severity after laparotomic myomectomy.

Our first aim was to investigate the effects of 5C15 cmH(2)O of PEEP on partitioned respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and dead space; secondly, we investigated whether respiratory system compliance and severity of hypoxemia could affect the response to PEEP on partitioned respiratory mechanics, gas exchange and dead space, dividing the population according to the median value of respiratory system compliance and oxygenation. Thirdly, we explored the effects of an additional PEEP selected according to the Empirical PEEP-FiO(2) table of the EPVent-2 study on partitioned respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in a subgroup of patients. METHODS: Sixty-one paralyzed mechanically ventilated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled (age 60 [54C67] years, PaO(2)/FiO(2) 113 [79C158] mmHg and PEEP 10 [10C10] cmH(2)O). Keeping constant tidal volume, respiratory rate and oxygen fraction, two PEEP levels (5 and 15 cmH(2)O) were selected. In a subgroup of patients an additional PEEP level was applied according to an Empirical PEEP-FiO(2) table (empirical PEEP). At each PEEP level gas exchange, partitioned lung mechanics and hemodynamic were collected. RESULTS: At 15 cmH(2)O of PEEP the lung elastance, lung stress and mechanical power were higher compared to 5 cmH(2)O. The PaO(2)/FiO(2), arterial carbon dioxide and ventilatory ratio increased at 15 cmH(2)O of PEEP. The arterialCvenous oxygen difference and central venous saturation were higher at 15 cmH(2)O of PEEP. Both the mechanics and gas exchange variables significantly increased although with high heterogeneity. By increasing the PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O, the changes in partitioned respiratory mechanics and mechanical power were not related to hypoxemia or respiratory compliance. The empirical PEEP was 18  1 cmH(2)O. The empirical PEEP significantly increased the PaO(2)/FiO(2) but also driving pressure, lung elastance, lung stress and mechanical power compared to 15 cmH(2)O of PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 ARDS during the early phase the effects of raising PEEP are highly variable and cannot easily be predicted by respiratory system characteristics, because of the heterogeneity of the disease.

Autologous costal cartilage grafts were electromechanically reshaped to resemble the rabbit auricular base framework and mechanically secured into the pinna base defect. Forty-nine costal cartilage specimens (four control and 45 experimental) successfully underwent EMR using a paired set of voltage-time combinations and survived for 6 or 12 weeks. Shape change was measured, and specimens were analyzed using digital imaging, tissue histology, and confocal microscopy with LIVE-DEAD viability assays.

The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B. The post-operative VAS score improved to a mean value of 2.33. The improvement in kyphosis was 26.24 immediate postoperatively and maintained at 25.9, percentage height loss reduced to 2.75% immediate postoperatively and maintained at 3.16% at 3 months follow-up.

These patients are at especially increased risk of morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment regimen, including those with solid organ transplants, rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease. SUMMARY: Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in this population.","output":"Management of immunosuppressants in the era of coronavirus disease-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Test whether high dose corticosteroid pulse therapy (HDCPT) with either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone is associated with increased survival in COVID-19 patients at risk of hyper-inflammatory response. Provide some initial diagnostic criteria using laboratory markers to stratify these patients. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study, 318 met the inclusion criteria. 64 patients (20.1%) were treated with HDCPT by using at least 1.5mg/kg/24h of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone equivalent. A multivariate Cox regression (controlling for co-morbidities and other therapies) was carried out to determine whether HDCPT (among other interventions) was associated with decreased mortality. We also carried out a 30-day time course analysis of laboratory markers between survivors and non-survivors, to identify potential markers for patient stratification. RESULTS: HDCPT showed a statistically significant decrease in mortality (HR = 0.087 [95% CI 0.021C0.36]; P < 0.001). 30-day time course analysis of laboratory marker tests showed marked differences in pro-inflammatory markers between survivors and non-survivors. As diagnostic criteria to define the patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, we propose the following parameters (IL-6 > = 40 pg/ml, and/or two of the following: C-reactive protein > = 100 mg/L, D-dimer > = 1000 ng/ml, ferritin > = 500 ng/ml and lactate dehydrogenase > = 300 U/L). CONCLUSIONS: HDCPT can be an effective intervention to increase COVID-19 survival rates in patients at risk of developing a COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory response, laboratory marker tests can be used to stratify these patients who should be given HDCPT.

Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways.

The unique kinetics of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020) to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.","output":"This time is different: model-based evaluation of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetics for disease control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We primarily quantified exposure patterns, transmission characteristics, and the clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection among household contacts of individuals with severe coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19).

In Europe, members of the genus Culex are often the most abundant insects on cave walls. Culex pipiens L., the common house mosquito, exists in two physically very similar, yet genetically and ecologically distinct biotypes (or forms, f.), namely Cx. pipiens f. pipiens and Cx. pipiens f. molestus. Autogeny and stenogamy of the latter form have been interpreted as adaptations to underground habitats. The epigean occurrence of the two biotypes and their hybrids was recently examined in Eastern Austria, but the hypogean distribution of the Cx. pipiens complex and morphologically similar non-members such as Cx. torrentium is unknown. Considering the key role of Culex mosquitoes in the epidemiology of certain zoonotic pathogens, the general paucity of data on species composition and relative abundance in subterranean shelters appears unfortunate. For a first pertinent investigation in Austria, we collected mosquitoes in four eastern federal states. Based on analyses of the ACE2 gene and the CQ11 microsatellite locus, 150 female and three male mosquitoes of the genus Culex, two females of the genus Culiseta and a single female of the genus Anopheles were determined to species level or below. In our catches, Cx. pipiens f. pipiens exceeded the apparent abundance of the purportedly cave-adapted Cx. pipiens f. molestus many times over. Records of Cx. hortensis and Cx. territans, two species rarely collected in Austria, lead us to infer that underground habitats host a higher diversity of culicine mosquitoes than previously thought.","output":"DNA-aided identification of Culex mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) reveals unexpected diversity in underground cavities in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The closure of campuses in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that scheduled practical activities for introductory chemistry students could not take place The first practical class started prior to shutdown, and 21 5% of the students undertook the face-to-face offering The remainder completed an online offering consisting of the same worksheet with videos of each of the tasks, which relate to ions in solution: conductivity and precipitation A KruskalWallis rank sum test comparison of the marks for the first practical showed that online students had, on average, a 0 9/10 drop in their mark compared to the face-to-face cohort We concluded that a significant proportion of students found the transition to online learning difficult with the technology we provided Rather than add another online learning activity, we chose to develop simple activities that students could complete at home, along with worksheets linking their observations to the theory taught in class The first kitchen chemistry activity included experimental measurement (timing water boiling), solubility (mixing water with salt, sugar or oil), heat capacity (heating salt, sugar, butter and water), combustion calculations for gas heating, and colligative properties (timing ice melting with and without added salt) The second kitchen chemistry activity involved adding a constant amount of sodium bicarbonate to differing amounts of vinegar to explore stoichiometry;relating this to gas law calculations, and an extraction of red cabbage or other colored food to investigate the pH of household items The aims of the kitchen chemistry experiments were to develop student observation skills, emphasize the importance of measurement and significant figures and provide some simple hands-on and relevant activities that could be done safely at home The proportion of students who submitted online chemistry practicals was the same as typically attends face-to-face practicals (90%) Preliminary evaluation through anonymous student comments and staff reflections suggests that this was a valuable exercise: most students were able to learn in this replacement hands-on environment, receiving mean scores of 7 5/10 or higher We conclude that relevant, engaging kitchen chemistry activities are useful for foundation level chemistry students","output":"Development and Use of Kitchen Chemistry Home Practical Activities during Unanticipated Campus Closures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pain following orthopedic surgery has always been a critical issue, which caused great distress to the patients. Analgesics in the treatment of postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery have aroused great attention from scholars, and numerous studies have been published in recent years. Bibliometrics could assist scholars in understanding the scope of research topics better, identifying research focuses and key literature, and analyzing the development and trend of analgesics in the treatment of postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery. METHODS: Literature data were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) of Web of Science (WOS) Core collection database. The articles from 1992 to December 2021 on analgesics in the treatment of postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery were recruited. The citation reports including the publication numbers, h-index, total citations, and average citations in terms of authors, organizations, and countries were obtained. Top 20 research directions, funds, and journals with the most publications were charted. The co-authorship relations in the analysis units of authors, organizations, and countries were analyzed by the online bibliometric tool and VOSviewer software. The author's keywords co-occurrence overlay map was visualized by the VOSviewer software. RESULTS: A total of 406 articles were retrieved from 1992 to December 4th, 2021, with 11,655 times cited, average citations of 28.57 per item, and an h-index of 55.

However, the female VTuber Jiangshanjiao was appropriated immediately as political satire by netizens to air public grievances. While political satire is widely considered as political resistance in authoritarian states, little research has addressed its combination with feminist narratives and online activism. This article builds on previous literature on the propagandistic nature of positive energy and the Chinese feminist movement to consider how positive energy lying under Jiangshanjiao was deconstructed and how femininity was invoked to serve for broader political purposes in a repressive online environment. Drawing on the framework of online connective action and political satire as a networked practice, this research sheds light on the hashtag #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod#. This research explores how the satirical hashtag was collectively produced in an Internet trolling culture and contributed to building a collective identity through personalized narratives. Through the feminist hashtag, netizens expressed their multilayered grievances against misogyny, state propaganda, and censorship.

How multiple mutualistic partners that provide the same service and compete for resources are maintained in mutualistic networks is an open question. We use a model bacterial community in which multiple 'partner strains' of Escherichia coli compete for a carbon source and exchange resources with a 'shared mutualist' strain of Salmonella enterica. In laboratory experiments, competing E. coli strains readily coexist in the presence of S. enterica, despite differences in their competitive abilities. We use ecological modeling to demonstrate that a shared mutualist can create temporary resource niche partitioning by limiting growth rates, even if yield is set by a resource external to a mutualism. This mechanism can extend to maintain multiple competing partner species.

METHODS: A total of 188 women, 96 pregnant and 92 non-pregnant were included. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) were applied to the participants after obtaining sociodemographic data. RESULTS: The depression scores of pregnant and non-pregnant women were similar (p = 0.846). We found that the depression scores were significantly higher among the group of participants who have lower economic status (p = 0.046). Moreover, the depression score was significantly higher among women who lost their income during the pandemic (p = 0.027). The score on the ASEX was significantly higher, and sexual dysfunction was more prevalent among women who have lower levels of schooling and income (p < 0.05). Likewise, the ASEX scores were significantly higher (p = 0.019) among the group who experienced greater income loss throughout the pandemic. Upon comparing the pregnant and non-pregnant groups, we detected that sexual dysfunction had a significantly higher rate among pregnant women (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In times of global crisis, such as the current pandemic, low-income families have an increased risk of experiencing depression and sexual dysfunction.

This paper examines the evolution of Central Asias five national economies since 1991 and their economic prospects. The 1990s were dominated by nation-building and the transition from central planning. By 2000, the transition from central planning was essentially complete and the varieties of market-based economies have changed little in the 21st century. Political systems, established in the 1990s around a general pattern of strong presidencies, also changed little, apart from in Kyrgyzstan. Between 1999 and 2014, national economic fortunes were largely shaped by the resource boom. Since the end of the boom, to re-orient Central Asia from dependence on primary product exports and remittances to more diversified outward-oriented economies, domestic change will be necessary. This paper assesses the pressures for economic reform and the forces resistant to change. The economic context includes an improved infrastructure for overland trade across Eurasia as well as an uncertain global trading system and the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic. The political context includes autocratic non-democracies with an elite that may be content with the unreformed economy, and generational change in leadership. Whereas the initial presidents had spent their entire lives in the planned economy, the current presidents have spent most of their adult lives in market-based economies, mirroring similar changes in the wider population, and may be less resistant to market-based reform and integration into the global economy.","output":"Central Asian Economies: Thirty Years After Dissolution of the Soviet Union"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to explore the lived experience of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary involvement.

In this study, we analyse the causal effect of a lockdown and consequently, the determinants of happiness during the aforementioned. A difference-in-difference approach is used to make causal inferences on the lockdown effect on happiness, and an OLS estimation investigates the determinants of happiness after lockdown. The results show that the lockdown had a significant and negative impact on happiness. In analysing the determinants of happiness after lockdown, we found that stay-at-home orders have positively impacted happiness during this period. On the other hand, other lockdown regulations such as a ban on alcohol sales, a fear of becoming unemployed and a greater reliance on social media have negative effects, culminating in a net loss in happiness.

Nrf2 is a transcription actor that helps maintain metabolic balance by providing redox-sensitive expression of numerous genes controlling normal day-to-day metabolic pathways. When ordinary metabolism is upset by extraordinary events such as injury, pathogenic infection, air or water pollution, ingestion of toxins, or simply by the slow but incessant changes brought about by aging and genetic variations, Nrf2 may also be called into action by the redox changes resulting from these events, whether acute or chronic. A complicating factor in all of this is that Nrf2 levels decline with aging, leaving the elderly less able to maintain proper redox balance. The dysregulated gene expression that results can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of pathological conditions, including susceptibility to viral infections.

Exogen surfactant in mechanically ventilated infants decreased duration of stay in the intensive care unit and had favorable effects on oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. This study aimed to evaluate the budget impact of surfactant therapy for bronchiolitis in critically ill infants in Colombia. METHODS: Budget impact analysis was performed to estimate the economic impact of surfactant therapy (ST) for the treatment of infants with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, requiring mechanical ventilation. The analysis considered a 4-year time horizon and Colombian National Health System perspective. The model estimated drug costs associated with current scenario using humidified oxygen or adrenaline nebulization, and new scenario adding exogen surfactant. The size of the target population was calculated using epidemiological national data. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis the 4-year costs associated to ST and no-ST were estimated to be US$ 55,188,132 and US$ 55,972,082 respectively, indicating savings for Colombian National Health equal to US$ 783,950 if ST is adopted for the routine management of patients with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, only increases in the cost of the surfactant drug and cost or length of stay in the pediatric intensive unit reduce the potential savings of ST.

Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in the SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. These proteins are considered potential human targets for nCoV bait proteins.

As older adults with serious illness increasingly rely on the support of others, there is a need to foster effective integration of the social convoy in digitally supported palliative care. OBJECTIVES: Conduct a qualitative study examining patient, social convoy, and health care provider perspectives on digital health for palliative care to inform the design of future digital solutions for older adults with serious illness and their social convoy. METHODS: Grounded theory approach using semi-structured interviews (N=81) with interprofessional health care providers, older adults with serious illness, and their social convoy participants at home, clinic, or Zoom. Interviews were conducted using question guides relevant to the participant group and audio recorded for verbatim transcription. Two coders lead the inductive analysis using open and axial coding. RESULTS: Thematic results aligned with the human centered design framework, which is a participatory approach to the design process that incorporates multiple user stakeholders to develop health solutions. The human centered design process and corresponding theme included: (1) Empathy: Patient, Caregiver, and Provider Experience reports participants experience with managing serious illness, caregiving, social support, and technology use. (2) Define: Reactions to Evidence-Based Care Concepts and Barriers illustrates participants perspectives on the domains of palliative care ranging from symptom management to psychosocial-spiritual care. (3) Ideation: Desired Features reports participant recommendations for designing digital health tools for palliative care domains. CONCLUSION: Digital health provides an opportunity to expand the reach of geriatric palliative care interventions. This paper documents human centered preferences of geriatric palliative care digital health to ensure technologies are relevant and meaningful to health care providers, patients, and the caregiving social convoy.","output":"Using Grounded Theory to Inform the Human-Centered Design of Digital Health in Geriatric Palliative Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There remains much uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19 transmission. Several studies attempt to infer NPI effectiveness with cross-country, data-driven modelling, by linking from NPI implementation dates to the observed timeline of cases and deaths in a country. These models make many assumptions. Previous work sometimes tests the sensitivity to variations in explicit epidemiological model parameters, but rarely analyses the sensitivity to the assumptions that are made by the choice the of model structure (structural sensitivity analysis). Such analysis would ensure that the inferences made are consistent under plausible alternative assumptions. Without it, NPI effectiveness estimates cannot be used to guide policy. We investigate four model structures similar to a recent state-of-the-art Bayesian hierarchical model. We find that the models differ considerably in the robustness of their NPI effectiveness estimates to changes in epidemiological parameters and the data. Considering only the models that have good robustness, we find that results and policy-relevant conclusions are remarkably consistent across the structurally different models. We further investigate the common assumptions that the effect of an NPI is independent of the country, the time, and other active NPIs. We mathematically show how to interpret effectiveness estimates when these assumptions are violated.","output":"On the robustness of effectiveness estimation of nonpharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A deep grasp of the interfacial properties between organic molecules and h-BN is an essential issue towards the full implementation of these two building blocks in the next-generation electronic devices. Here, we report on the geometric and electronic features of C60evaporated on a single layer of hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) grown on the Rh(110) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Two different molecular assemblies of C60on the h-BN/Rh(110) surface were observed. The first STM combined study at room temperature (RT) and at low temperatures (40 K) of the molecular orientation of C60on a 2D layered material is presented. Intramolecular resolution images have allowed to demonstrate the existence of a phase transition of C60over the h-BN/Rh(110) surface similar to that found on bulk solid C60. At RT molecules exhibit random orientations, while at 40 K such rotational disorder vanishes and they adopt a common orientation over the h-BN/Rh(110) surface. The decrease of the thermal energy allows the recognition between C60molecules, which makes them to become equally oriented in the configuration at which the van der Waals intermolecular interactions are optimized. Bias dependent submolecular features obtained by means of high resolution STM images have been interpreted as the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). Besides, STS data evidenced that fullerenes are electronically decoupled from the substrate, with a negligible charge transfer effect if any.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether young children can feasibly self-collect SARS-CoV-2 samples for surveillance testing over the course of an academic year. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective pilot cohort study was conducted from September 10, 2020, to June 10, 2021, at a K-8 school in San Mateo County, California. The research consisted of quantitative data collection efforts: (1) demographic data collected, (2) student sample self-collection error rates, and (3) student sample self-collection time durations. Students were enrolled in a hybrid learning model, a teaching model in which students were taught in person and online, with students having the option to attend virtually as needed. Data were collected under waiver of consent from students participating in weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Errors over time for self-collection of nasal swabs such as contaminated swabs and inadequate or shallow swabbing; time taken for sample collection. RESULTS: Of 296 participants, 148 (50.0%) were boys and 148 (50.0%) were girls. A total of 87 participants (29.2%) identified as Asian; 2 (0.6%), Black or African American; 13 (4.4%), Hispanic/Latinx; 103 (34.6%), non-Hispanic White; 87 (29.2%), multiracial; and 6 (2.0%), other. The median school grade was fourth grade. From September 2020 to March 2021, a total of 4203 samples were obtained from 221 students on a weekly basis, while data on error rates were collected. Errors occurred in 2.7% (n = 107; 95% CI, 2.2%-3.2%) of student encounters, with the highest rate occurring on the first day of testing (20 [10.2%]). There was an overall decrease in error rates over time. From April to June 2021, a total of 2021 samples were obtained from 296 students on a weekly basis while data on encounter lengths were collected. Between April and June 2021, 193 encounters were timed. The mean duration of each encounter was 70 seconds (95% CI, 66.4-73.7 seconds). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mastery of self-collected lower nasal swabs is possible for children 5 years and older. Testing duration can be condensed once students gain proficiency in testing procedures.

This study examined clinical characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients in Jakarta, Indonesia, from March 2 to July 31, 2020. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included all hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in 55 hospitals. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including hospital outcomes (discharge or death). We used logistic regression to examine factors associated with mortality. FINDINGS: Of 4265 patients with a definitive outcome by July 31, 3768 (88%) were discharged and 497 (12%) died. The median age was 46 years (IQR 32C57), 5% were children, and 31% had >1 comorbidity. Age-specific mortalities were 11% (7/61) for <5 years; 4% (1/23) for 5C9; 2% (3/133) for 10C19; 2% (8/638) for 20C29; 3% (26/755) for 30C39; 7% (61/819) for 40C49; 17% (155/941) for 50C59; 22% (132/611) for 60C69; and 34% (96/284) for 70. Risk of death was associated with higher age, male sex; pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; clinical diagnosis of pneumonia; multiple (>3) symptoms; immediate ICU admission, or intubation. Across all ages, risk of death was higher for patients with >1 comorbidity compared to those without; notably the risk was six-fold increased among patients <50 years (adjusted odds ratio 5.87, 95%CI 3.28C10.52; 27% vs 3% mortality). INTERPRETATION: Overall in-hospital mortality was lower than reported in high-income countries, probably due to younger age distribution and fewer comorbidities. Deaths occurred across all ages, with >10% mortality among children <5 years and adults >50 years.","output":"Clinical characteristics and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Jakarta, Indonesia: A hospital-based retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais has a specialized goat milk production chain. Goat milk is superior in quality compared with milk of other domestic species, and the demand for milk and milk products for the public has increased. Data on dairy goat breeding in Minas Gerais are scarce and relatively old, and this lack of information has limited the implementation of prophylactic measures, especially for mastitis, which represents the biggest sanitary problem for dairy herds. The objective of this work was to characterize mastitis and bacteria associated with it in milking goats in the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais. It also causes socioeconomic problems and market issues for dairy goat farming. A total of 539 lactating goats were examined and 268 individual samples (one for teat) were collected from animals positive for strip cup test and/or the California Mastitis Test (CMT). Microbiological cultures were carried out on blood agar medium and the bacteria were subjected to phenotypic, genotypic and antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 28.0% and the clinical prevalence was 2.8%. Bacterial multiplication was obtained in 62% of samples. One hundred eighty seven total bacteria were identified. The most common species identified was Staphylococcus aureus (60%), followed Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%,), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.9%) e Staphylococcus caprae (4.3%). Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus presented a profile of resistance to antimicrobials belonging to the beta-lactam class (penicillin, ampicillin and oxacillin) in addition to tetracycline, in contrast to the other antimicrobials tested. Twelve percent of multidrug resistence (MDR) was found in five microregions. Among the bacteria with the highest prevalence of MDR, 38.5% were E. coli and 10.6% were S. aureus. The producers of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais are technicians who work with specialized dairy breeds and practise good management. However, some measures related to prophylaxis and control of diseases, such as vaccination, have low adherence or are not performed due to a lack of veterinary assistance. This is the first study focusing on this region, which is highly prominent in goat milk production in Brazil.

Laparoscopic guidelines were revised to address the theoretical risks associated with transmission of viral droplets and many elective surgeries were suspended. Aims: We aimed to describe strategies that lowered viral transmission risks such as alternative anaesthetic techniques and low-cost infection control and prevention practices for laparoscopic surgeries. Settings: and Design : Seventy two patients who presented to hospital as acute surgical emergencies between April and July 2020 and analyzed clinical data of 50 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgeries. This was a prospective observational study. Methods: and Material : Procedures were performed under spinal anaesthesia utilizing alternate electrosurgical units and simple smoke evacuation systems. Statistical analysis used : Continuous variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and range. Discrete variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Univariate testing was performed using t test or Mann-Whitney U test. ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for categorical data. Results: Of the 50 operated patients, the median age was 23 years with 54% females. The most frequently performed procedure was laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the overall median theatre time was 47 minutes, and 40% patients were managed as day cases with reduced hospital stay. Conclusions: Use of spinal anaesthesia, a simple smoke evacuator and some additional measures during laparoscopic surgeries reduce theatre time and length of hospital stay.

Multispectral images were then processed with spatial wavelet decomposition, histogram enhancing, thresholds application, image fusion, false colors compositing and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. Software used have been GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and Mathworks MATLAB (which can be substituted for the processing steps proposed by the built-in functions of GNU OCTAVE open-source software).

Cognitive dysfunction has been proposed to be a primary mediator of functional impairment. Therefore, the new non-pharmacological procognitive strategy INtegral Cognitive REMediation for Depression (INCREM) has been developed with the aim of targeting cognitive and psychosocial functioning. METHODS: This is a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with three treatment arms. Fifty-two depressed patients in clinical remission, with psychosocial difficulties and cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to receive INCREM intervention, Psychoeducation programme, or treatment as usual. Patients were assessed before and after the study period, and six months after. The primary outcome was the change from baseline of patients' psychosocial functioning. Changes in cognitive functioning and other variables were considered secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The analysis showed a significant improvement in psychosocial functioning in the INCREM group, especially six months after the intervention, compared to patients who received the psychoeducation programme. An improvement in cognitive performance was also observed in the INCREM group. LIMITATIONS: This study includes a small sample size due to the anticipated end of the clinical trial because of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: These results provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility and potential efficacy of the INCREM program to improve not only cognitive performance but also psychosocial functioning in clinically remitted depressed patients, and such improvement is maintained six months after.

The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States. METHODS: We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761C256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). RESULTS: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.

The clinical data of 276 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 33 designated hospitals of Hubei, China from December 21, 2019 to March 18, 2020, were collected and randomly divided into a training and a validation cohort by a ratio of 2:1. Cox stepwise regression analysis was carried out to select prognostic factors. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort. The predictive accuracy of the model was quantified by C-index and time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (t-AUC). Internal validation was assessed by the validation cohort. Risk stratification based on the model was carried out. Decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model. We found age, cancer type, computed tomography baseline image features (ground glass opacity and consolidation), laboratory findings (lymphocyte count, serum levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, urea, and d-dimer) were significantly associated with symptomatic deterioration. The C-index of the model was 0.755 in the training cohort and 0.779 in the validation cohort. The t-AUC values were above 0.7 within 8 weeks both in the training and validation cohorts.

A vaccine is urgently needed to control transmission of this debilitating disease. As some promising schistosomiasis vaccine candidates are moving through pre-clinical and clinical testing, we review the immunological challenges that these vaccine candidates may encounter in transitioning through the clinical trial phases in endemic settings. Prior exposure of the target population to schistosomes and other infections may impact vaccine response and efficacy and therefore requires considerable attention. Schistosomes are known for their potential to induce T-reg/IL-10 mediated immune suppression in populations which are chronically infected. Moreover, endemicity of schistosomiasis is focal whereby target and trial populations may exhibit several degrees of prior exposure as well as in utero exposure which may increase heterogeneity of vaccine responses. The age dependent distribution of exposure and development of acquired immunity, and general differences in the baseline immunological profile, adds to the complexity of selecting suitable trial populations. Similarly, prior or concurrent infections with other parasitic helminths, viral and bacterial infections, may alter immunological responses. Consequently, treatment of co-infections may benefit the immunogenicity of vaccines and may be considered despite logistical challenges. On the other hand, viral infections leave a life-long immunological imprint on the human host. Screening for serostatus may be needed to facilitate interpretation of vaccine responses. Co-delivery of schistosome vaccines with PZQ is attractive from a perspective of implementation but may complicate the immunogenicity of schistosomiasis vaccines. Several studies have reported PZQ treatment to induce both transient and long-term immuno-modulatory effects as a result of tegument destruction, worm killing and subsequent exposure of worm antigens to the host immune system. These in turn may augment or antagonize vaccine immunogenicity. Understanding the complex immunological interactions between vaccine, co-infections or prior exposure is essential in early stages of clinical development to facilitate phase 3 clinical trial design and implementation policies. Besides well-designed studies in different target populations using schistosome candidate vaccines or other vaccines as models, controlled human infections could also help identify markers of immune protection in populations with different disease and immunological backgrounds.","output":"Immunological Considerations for Schistosoma Vaccine Development: Transitioning to Endemic Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo del estudio: Con la aparicin del virus Covid-19, se han tomado medidas preventivas para controlar su avance en todo el mundo, provocando importantes impactos en el sector turstico y obligando a las empresas a replantear sus acciones.

Aging is an inexorable, time-dependent, multifactorial process characterized by a series of progressive and irreversible physiological changes associated with loss of functional, psychological, and social capabilities. Numerous factors, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular senescence, and an irreversible geriatric syndrome known as frailty, contribute to human body deterioration in aging.

We analyzed the role of testosterone in the immune response, and we hypothesized possible mechanisms to explain the high incidence of COVID-19 infection and a worse clinical course in elderly male patients. Testosterone may impair the immune response, and this effect could explain the greater susceptibility of men to infection. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the respiratory epithelial cells, leading to COVID-19 disease. It is crucial to emphasize that testosterone levels and chemical castration (e.g. by androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer) may have contrasting roles in the phases of COVID-19 infection. Whereas low testosterone levels may be protective against the initial susceptibility (due to a restoration of immunological functions and a block of TMPRSS2), low testosterone may stimulate a worse clinical course in the advanced COVID-19 infection as it could exacerbate or activate the cytokine storm. If testosterone levels play these different roles, it is necessary to carefully identify patients for any indicated testosterone manipulation.","output":"Testosterone target therapy: focus on immune response, controversies and clinical implications in patients with COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hypothesis here states that neural network algorithms such as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) have higher accuracy in differentiating malicious and semi-structured phishing URLs.

We conducted this study to explore pharmacy students perspective towards the utilization of SPs in Qatar and to identify areas that require improvement. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used among students and recent graduates of the College of Pharmacy at Qatar University (QU-CPH). First, their perspectives toward the current utilization of SPs at QU-CPH was explored using a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Following this, we conducted six focus group discussions based on the analysis of the questionnaire results. The findings of the two phases were interpreted through integration of the quantitative and qualitative phases. RESULTS: The majority of the participants (> 90%) reported that interactions with SPs are important in building good communication and counseling skills during professional skills course activities. Similarly, most of the respondents (80%) indicated that interactions with SPs prepared them to apply the clinical skills gained during professional skills and patient assessment sessions in real-life. In addition, they reported that interactions with SPs during competency-based assessments were good experiences. The participants disagreed with the notion that interaction with SPs of opposite gender was uncomfortable for them. Themes identified from the focus groups include: interactions with trained SPs compared to faculty SPs, standardization and consistency of SPs roles, communication and language barriers, simulations of real-life case scenarios, SPs competence and preparedness, psychological impact associated with interaction with SPs, proposed strategies for improving the SP program. Identified areas for improvement include the need for strengthening the SP training and orientation program as well as the SP selection criteria.

METHODS: We asked our students to install the multiplatform Fiji viewer with Beth Israel PET/CT plugin (http://petctviewer.org) on their personal computers and connect to a central image database in the university network based on the public domain orthanc server (https://orthanc-server.com). At the end of course, we conducted an anonymous student survey. RESULTS: The new system was online within eight days, including regulatory approval. All 76 students (100a%) in the fifth year completed their course work, reading five anonymized PET/CT cases as planned. 41 (53a%) students answered the survey. Fiji was challenging to install with a mean score of 1.8 on a 5-point Likert scale (5a=aeasy, 1a=adifficult).

Genetic screening (GS) improves patient outcomes and is accessible to the community. Family physicians (FPs) are ideally placed to offer GS. There is a need for FPs to adopt GS to address anticipated genetic specialist shortages. OBJECTIVE: To explore FP attitudes, perceived roles, motivators and barriers, towards GS; and explore similarities and differences between private and public sector FPs. METHODS: We developed a semi-structured interview guide using existing literature. We interviewed private and public sector FPs recruited by purposive, convenience and snowballing strategies, by telephone or video to theme saturation. All sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded for themes by two independent researchers with an adjudicator. RESULTS: Thirty FPs were interviewed (15 private, 15 public). Theme saturation was reached for each group. A total of 12 themes (6 common, 3 from private-practice participants, 3 public-employed participants) emerged. Six common major themes emerged: personal lack of training and experience, roles and relevance of GS to family medicine, reluctance and resistance to adding GS to practice, FP motivations for adoption, patient factors as barrier, and potential solutions. Three themes (all facilitators) were unique to the private group: strong rapport with patients, high practice autonomy, and high patient literacy. Three themes (all barriers) were unique to the public group: lack of control, patients lower socioeconomic status, and rigid administrative infrastructure. CONCLUSION: FPs are motivated to incorporate GS but need support for implementation. Policy-makers should consider the practice setting when introducing new screening functions. Strategies to change FP behaviours should be sensitive to their sense of autonomy, and the external factors (either as facilitators or as barriers) shaping FP practices in a given clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE To measure the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 stool shedding in children with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 NP polymerase chain reactions (PCR) tests, and to determine clinical factors associated with GI shedding. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled hospitalized patients 0 to 21 years old with a positive or a negative SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR test who had respiratory and/or GI symptoms. Participants were surveyed, and stool samples were sent for viral PCR testing. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate bivariate associations of stool PCR test positivity with categorical variables. RESULTS Sixty-seven patients were consented; 34 patients did not provide stool samples so 33 patients were included: 17 NP-positive and 16 NP-negative for SARS-CoV-2. Eight of the 17 NP-positive patients had a positive stool PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, while none of the 16 SARS-CoV-2 NP-negative patients had a positive result (P < .01).

To determine the antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms of disulfiram (DSF) on perimysial orbital fibroblasts (pOFs) in a GO model in vitro, primary cultures of pOFs from eight patients with GO and six subjects without GO (NG) were established. CCK-8 and EdU assays, IF, qPCR, WB, three-dimensional collagen gel contraction assays, cell scratch experiments, and ELISAs were performed. After TGF-1 stimulation of pOFs, the proliferation rate of the GO group but not the NG group increased significantly. DSF dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, contraction, and migration of pOFs in the GO group. Additionally, DSF dose-dependently inhibited fibrosis and extracellular matrix production markers (FN1, COL1A1, -SMA, CTGF) at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, DSF mediates antifibrotic effects on GO pOFs partially through the ERK-Snail signaling pathway.

Target analysis of hit compounds revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with antiandrogenic drugs reduced ACE2 expression and protected hESC-derived lung organoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, clinical data on COVID-19 patients demonstrated that prostate diseases, which are linked to elevated androgen, are significant risk factors and genetic variants that increase androgen levels are associated with higher disease severity.

Redox homeostasis is a prerequisite for human health, in which the physiological levels of nonradical reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as the primary second messengers to modulate physiological redox signaling by orchestrating multiple redox sensors. However, excessive ROS accumulation, termed oxidative stress (OS), leads to biomolecule damage and subsequent occurrence of various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Herein, starting with the evolution of redox biology, we reveal the roles of ROS as multifaceted physiological modulators to mediate redox signaling and sustain redox homeostasis. In addition, we also emphasize the detailed OS mechanisms involved in the initiation and development of several important diseases. ROS as a double-edged sword in disease progression suggest two different therapeutic strategies to treat redox-relevant diseases, in which targeting ROS sources and redox-related effectors to manipulate redox homeostasis will largely promote precision medicine. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the redox signaling networks under physiological and pathological conditions will facilitate the development of redox medicine and benefit patients with redox-relevant diseases.","output":"Redox signaling at the crossroads of human health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renal transplant (RT) recipients are at increased risk for infectious complications.

SETTING: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom.

Microorganism counting techniques are crucial in microorganism analysis, helping biologists and related researchers quantitatively analyze the microorganisms and calculate their characteristics, such as biomass concentration and biological activity. However, traditional microorganism manual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and turbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which are difficult to be applied in large-scale applications. In order to improve this situation, image analysis is applied for microorganism counting since the 1980s, which consists of digital image processing, image segmentation, image classification and suchlike. Image analysis-based microorganism counting methods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In this article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods using digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as bacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized based on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by methodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for microorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological points. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this paper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism counting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated microorganism counting systems in the future.

Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively observed the incidence of major bleed in 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, the uncommon sites of bleeding shed the light on the need for additional studies in our population to identify the predisposing risk factors and mechanisms behind it.","output":"Increased incidence of massive hemorrhage at uncommon sites after initiation of systemic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and high sitting time are directly related to mortality and morbidity of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the current prevalence of physical inactivity and high sitting time, to analyze the trends, and to estimate the association of meeting/not meeting physical activity recommendations and low/high sitting time with sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index categories. METHODOLOGY: Data from the 2018 National Health and Nutrition Survey were used. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sitting minutes per week were calculated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ). In total, 38,033 questionnaires of adults aged 20 to 69-year-old were analyzed. Adults were classified as physically inactive if they achieved less than 150 minutes per week of MVPA and as with high sitting time if they accumulated more than 420 minutes of sitting per day. Health and Nutrition National Surveys (ENSANUT) 2006, 2012 and 2018 were used to estimate the trends. RESULTS: In total, 16.5% were classified as physically inactive and 11.3% within the high sitting time category. Both prevalences increased more than 40% during the 12-y period (2006C2018). In 2018, men, younger adults, those living in urban areas, and people within the highest socioeconomical status and educational levels were more likely to not achieve physical activity recommendations and to be classified in the highest sitting time category.

AIMS We designed this study to derive an integrated propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model in children and to describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil on the electroencephalographic bispectral index effect. METHODS Thirty children (mean age: 5.45 years, range 1.3-11.9; mean weight: 23.5 kg, range 8.5-61) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia were studied. After sevoflurane induction, maintenance of anesthesia was based on propofol and remifentanil. Blood samples to measure propofol concentration were collected during anesthesia maintenance and up to 6 hours in the postoperative period. Bispectral index data were continuously recorded throughout the study. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed using population modeling. The Greco model was used to examine the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil for BIS response RESULTS: Propofol pharmacokinetic data from a previous study in 53 children were pooled with current data and simultaneously analyzed. Propofol pharmacokinetics were adequately described by a three-compartment distribution model with first-order elimination. Theory-based allometric relationships based on TBW improved the model fit. The Greco model supported an additive interaction between propofol and remifentanil. Remifentanil showed only a minor effect in BIS response.

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients &#8805;80 years of age with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to one of three medical departments in Denmark from March 1st to June 1st, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients (47% male) with a mean age of 85 years were included. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (74%), cough (62%), and shortness of breath (54%). Furthermore, atypical symptoms like confusion (29%), difficulty walking (13%), and falls (8%) were also present. In-hospital and 30-day mortality were 31% (n = 32) and 41% (n = 42), respectively.

A total of 82 school children met the B40 classification and selection criteria; therefore, universal sampling was done. Analyses were done according to age group: Level 1 included ages 7 to 9 years, while Level 2 comprised 10- to 12-year-olds. Results The mean age of the 82 Chinese school children was 9.721.5 years; the percentage of refractive errors found was 80.48%. A total of 53 (64.63%) children had myopia. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant difference (P=0.038) in the refractive error between age groups Level 1 and 2, but no significant difference (P=0.947) was observed in refractive error between genders.

Results show that tourism pressure may benefit self-reported health but only among residents aged over 50 years old living in rural contexts, or over 65 living in low density urban areas. As for younger groups (under 50) living in high density cities, tourism is longitudinally associated with worsened self-reported health. These results, which are supported by instrumental-variable estimations, suggest that urban residents and younger groups do not benefit from tourism. This might be due to a number of side effects related to increased living costs, precarious labour, and conflicts related to public space.

Although RTT patients exhibit delayed onset of symptoms, several evidences demonstrate that MeCP2 deficiency alters early development of the brain. Indeed, during early maturation, Mecp2 null cortical neurons display widespread transcriptional changes, reduced activity, and defective morphology. It has been proposed that during brain development these elements are linked in a feed-forward cycle where neuronal activity drives transcriptional and morphological changes that further increase network maturity. We hypothesized that the enhancement of neuronal activity during early maturation might prevent the onset of RTT-typical molecular and cellular phenotypes. Accordingly, we show that the enhancement of excitability, obtained by adding to neuronal cultures Ampakine CX546, rescues transcription of several genes, neuronal morphology, and responsiveness to stimuli. Greater effects are achieved in response to earlier treatments. In vivo, short and early administration of CX546 to Mecp2 null mice prolongs lifespan, delays the disease progression, and rescues motor abilities and spatial memory, thus confirming the value for RTT of an early restoration of neuronal activity.","output":"The enhancement of activity rescues the establishment of Mecp2 null neuronal phenotypes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Air pollution leads to many adverse health conditions, mainly manifested by respiratory or cardiac symptoms. Previous studies are limited as to whether air pollutants were associated to influenza-like illness (ILI). This study aimed to explore the association between air pollutants and outpatient visits for ILI, especially during an outbreak of influenza. METHODS: Daily counts of hospital visits for ILI were obtained from Peking University Third Hospital between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018. A generalized additive Poisson model was applied to examine the associations between air pollutants concentrations and daily outpatient visits for ILI when adjusted for the meteorological parameters. RESULTS: There were 35862 outpatient visits at the fever clinic for ILI cases. Air quality index (AQI), PM(2.5), PM(10), CO and O(3) on lag0 days, as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) on lag1 days, were significantly associated with an increased risk of outpatient visits for ILI from January 2015 to November 2017. From December 2017 to March 2018, on lag0 days, air pollutants PM(2.5) [risk ratio (RR) = 0.971, 95% CI: 0.963-0.979], SO(2) (RR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.840C0.948) and CO (RR = 0.306, 95% CI: 0.153C0.612) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of outpatient visits for ILI. Interestingly, on the lag2 days, all the pollutants were significantly associated with a reduced risk of outpatient visits for ILI except for O(3). We did not observe the linear correlations between the outpatient visits for ILI and any of air pollutants, which were instead associated via a curvilinear relationship. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the air pollutants may be associated with an increased risk of outpatient visits for ILI during the non-outbreak period and with a decreased risk during the outbreak period, which may be linked with the use of disposable face masks and the change of outdoor activities.

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

This is particularly so in light of the Covid-19 pandemic which has highlighted the detrimental psychosocial consequences of loneliness. Loneliness is a particularly pervasive problem among young adults, but despite this, most research examining loneliness is among older adults. Loneliness is a known risk factor for poor health and personal wellbeing. However, the extent to which other aspects of social wellbeing (e.g., isolation, social support) may mitigate the relationship between loneliness and personal wellbeing is unclear. Loneliness is often used interchangeably with related, yet distinct aspects of social wellbeing, such as isolation. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate factors that relate to loneliness, factors that relate to other components of social wellbeing, and the possible interactions between these constructs. Consequently, we aim to examine the interplay of loneliness and isolation on personal wellbeing.MethodsWe make use of cross-sectional sample of 965 young people aged 16C24 from the 2018 wave of the Community Life Survey to conduct regression-based analyses. This allows us to evaluate for a direct effect of loneliness on personal wellbeing, and for an interaction effect between loneliness and isolation to determine if the presence of both loneliness and isolation is predictive of poorer wellbeing. Finally, we use moderated regression to assess whether individual, social, and community level factors influence the relationship between loneliness and personal wellbeing.ResultsPreliminary results identify that loneliness is consistently associated with poorer personal wellbeing among young people. Isolation neither predicts wellbeing, nor moderates associations between loneliness and wellbeing. Factors such as trust in ones neighbourhood, not acting as a carer, and being a fulltime student were associated with greater wellbeing. At the individual level, a moderating effect of sex was found, and social factors (e.g., being able to count on friends) moderated the association between loneliness and wellbeing.ConclusionResults suggests that the presence of both loneliness and isolation does not increase risk of poor personal wellbeing among young people. Rather, the subjective experience of loneliness is independently detrimental to wellbeing. Our results also identified that being of female gender was associated with increased risk of loneliness impacting on personal wellbeing, but that strong emotional support may act as a protective factor against loneliness, and therefore improve personal wellbeing. It is also important to foster community trust and engagement to improve wellbeing, and that young people with caring responsibilities may be particularly at risk of low personal wellbeing.","output":"Loneliness and personal wellbeing in young people: the moderating effects of social wellbeing and socio-demographic factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Totally laparoscopic liver resection of lesions located in the posterosuperior segments is reported to be technically challenging. This study aimed to define whether these technical difficulties affect the surgical outcome. METHODS A total of 220 patients underwent laparoscopic liver resection during 244 procedures from August 1998 to December 2010. The patients who underwent primary minor single liver resection for malignant tumors affecting either posterosuperior segments 1, 7, 8, and, 4a (group 1) or anterolateral segments 2, 3, 5, 6, and 4b (group 2) were included in the study. Seventy-five procedures found to be eligible for the study, including 28 patients in group 1 and 47 patients in group 2. Intraoperative unfavorable incidents were graded on the basis of the Satava approach and postoperative complications were graded in agreement with the Accordion classification. RESULTS The operative time (median, 127 min) and blood loss (median, 200 ml) were equivalent in the two groups. The rates for blood transfusions and intraoperative accidents did not differ statistically between the groups. A tumor-free margin resection was achieved in 94.7% of the procedures, equivalently in both groups. The postoperative course was similar in the two groups. Postoperative complications developed in 2 cases (7.1%) in group 1 and 2 cases (4.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.626). The median hospital stay was 2 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection for lesions located in posterosuperior segments represents certain technical challenges.

Whilst reduced or limited time outdoors, and thus, exposure to diurnal bright light appear to be detrimental to sleep and emotional well-being in old age, further research is required to confirm this relationship. Materials and Method: To build on earlier work, a two-week study was conducted in a sample of 79 community-dwelling older adults recruited by using snowball sampling method. Throughout the study, the participants were allowed to be outdoors from 10.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. on weekdays. Whilst the participants were performing their daily habitual activities, they were asked to keep an activity diary and report on their sleep quality and emotional wellbeing using two questionnaires. Results: The results demonstrated that participants daily time spent outdoors (49.13 minutes on average) positively correlated with their perceived sleep quality and emotional well-being at various CC but significant CC levels (p<0.05). Moreover, significant negative correlations were identified between participants sleep quality and experienced emotional disturbances (p<0.001). Conclusion: Based on the research findings, it is reasonable to conclude that spending momentary periods outdoors may have adverse consequences for the elderly. To maintain a healthy sleep-wake cycle and alleviate related emotional problems in old age, increasing outdoor time and diurnal bright light exposure should be encouraged.","output":"Relationship of daily time spent outdoors with sleep quality and emotional well-being among community-dwelling older adults during covid-19 restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, a novel formulation of polysulfobetaine, poly (sulfobetaine-acrylamide-allyl glycidyl ether) (PSPB-AM-AGE), was synthesized and grafted onto cotton.

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated health system of six hospitals between March 15 and August 15, 2020. To determine predictive factors of mortality, a set of 17 covariates were selected on the basis of clinical relevance to COVID-19 outcomes. The indications for medication use were evaluated in a subset of research patients. Results In 694 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age = 58 yr, 46% men, 65% AA), an overall mortality rate was 17.4% (121/694). Logistic regression analysis identified age (aOR=1.66 per decade, p&lt;0.001), race other than AA or white (aOR=3.03, p=0.002), cancer (aOR=2.22, p=0.008), diabetes (aOR=1.95, p=0.003), anti-HTN (aOR=0.46, p=0.001) and PPI use (aOR=2.72, p&lt;0.001) as predictors of mortality. There was no significant mortality difference observed with the use of H2 receptor antagonists. Moreover, PPI use was associated with higher mortality risk in AA (aOR=4.16, 95% CI = 2.28 to 7.59) than in non-AA patients (aOR=1.62, 95% CI = 0.82, 3.19, p=0.04 for interaction) (see Figure 1). The prevalence of PPI use in African Americans (32.6%147/451) and non-AA patients (32.9%, 80/243) were comparable. No other associations were found to differ between the two groups. Indications for PPI use in 31 of 87 research participants were: erosive esophagitis / recent hemorrhage (13%), non-erosive GERD symptoms (45%) and NSAID prophylaxis (42%).

METHODS A rabbit model of carotid vessel occlusion was used to test the hypothesis that SA-NT treatment coupled with TEB provides high recanalization rates while reducing vascular injury. We evaluated angiographic recanalization with TEB alone, intra-arterial delivery of soluble r-tPA alone, or TEB combined with 2 doses of intra-arterial infusion of either the SA-NT or soluble r-tPA. Vascular injury was compared against stent-retriever thrombectomy. RESULTS Shear-targeted delivery of r-tPA using the SA-NT resulted in the highest rate of complete recanalization when compared with controls (P=0.0011). SA-NT (20 mg) had a higher likelihood of obtaining complete recanalization as compared with TEB alone (odds ratio 65.019, 95% confidence interval 1.77, >1000; P=0.0231), intra-arterial r-tPA alone (odds ratio 65.019, 95% confidence interval 1.77, >1000; P=0.0231), or TEB with soluble r-tPA (2 mg; odds ratio 18.78, 95% confidence interval 1.28, 275.05; P=0.0322).

Then, we added the tertiles of the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those of health aids to evaluate the correspondence with the outcome measures. RESULTS: Five regions out of 20, the most industrialized northern regions, which were affected both earlier and more severely by the outbreak, registered both mortality and economic value loss above the overall medians. The southern regions, which were affected later and less severely, had low mortality and less economic impact. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that considering health and economic outcomes in the assessment of response to pandemics offers a bigger picture perspective of the outbreak and could allow policymakers and health managers to choose systemic, personalized strategies, in case of a feared second epidemic wave.","output":"Looking for the right balance between human and economic costs during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colonial cheese is a traditional dairy product in southern Brazil.

Central venous catheters have also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on discharge.

Pioneering histological studies have examined the developmental associations between their reproductive states and spermatogenesis by morphological observation. However, a molecular histological atlas of Japanese macaque spermatogenesis is only in its infancy, limiting our understanding of spermatogenesis ontogeny related to their reproductive changes. Here, we performed immunofluorescence analyses of spermatogenesis in Japanese macaque testes to determine the expression of a subset of marker proteins. The present molecular histological analyses readily specified major spermatogonial subtypes as SALL4+ A spermatogonia and Ki67+/C-KIT+ B spermatogonia. The expression of DAZL, SCP1, ?3H2AX, VASA, and calmegin further showed sequential changes regarding the protein expression profile and chromosomal structures during spermatogenesis in a differentiation stage-specific manner.

Antidepressants are commonly used in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Both HCQ and antidepressants are reported to cause QTc prolongation, which potentially increases the risk for a lethal ventricular arrhythmia that can result in sudden death. The objective of the study is to investigate the risk of QTc prolongation associated with HCQ use concomitantly with antidepressants in lupus patients with FMS. METHODS Outpatient 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were extracted from an electronic medical record and QTc intervals were calculated using the Bazett's formula. QTc intervals in 135 lupus patients treated with HCQ with or without antidepressants were analyzed. RESULTS We found taking HCQ was associated with mild QTc prolongation, and the prolongation was not affected by the length of time of HCQ use or the accumulated dose of HCQ. Concurrent use of HCQ and antidepressants had not further increased QTc intervals in this cohort. However, four patients on HCQ alone and three patients on HCQ and antidepressants were found QTc interval more than 500 milliseconds and most of these patients had underlying cardiological conditions. CONCLUSIONS It is important to evaluate lupus patient with ECG before and after starting HCQ, though our study suggests that while HCQ use did prolong the QTc in some, but the overall prolongation was subclinical, with or without antidepressants. ECG monitoring therefore is essential to identify new changes potentially related to drug use.","output":"Evaluating the risk of QTc prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine use with antidepressants in lupus patients with fibromyalgia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic care management is dependent on productive interactions between patients and healthcare professionals.

We collected qualitative data based on interviews with nurses and responses to open-ended survey questions from patients, prior to and post using an eHealth service for self-monitoring and digital communication. We found that eHealths influence on productive interactions was characterized by unconstrained access, health parameter surveillance, and data-driven feedback, with implications for self-care and healthcare. Our findings indicate that eHealth perforates the boundaries that define interactions under traditional, non-digital care. This was manifested in expressions of uncertainty and in blurred boundaries between self-care and healthcare.

METHODS: We are conducting a randomized controlled trial in which 900 adults who are being discharged after nonelective surgery from 8 Canadian hospitals are randomly assigned to receive virtual care with RAM or standard care. Outcome adjudicators are masked to group allocations. Patients in the experimental group learn how to use the study's tablet computer and RAM technology, which will measure their vital signs. For 30 days, patients take daily biophysical measurements and complete a recovery survey. Patients interact with nurses via the cellular modem-enabled tablet, who escalate care to preassigned and available physicians if RAM measurements exceed predetermined thresholds, patients report symptoms, a medication error is identified or the nurses have concerns they cannot resolve. The primary outcome is number of days alive at home during the 30 days after randomization. INTERPRETATION: This trial will inform management of patients after discharge following surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic and offer insights for management of patients who undergo nonelective surgery in a nonpandemic setting.

Questions remain with respect to the durability and functionality of SARS CoV 2 antibodies. This study explored antibody responses in recovered COVID 19 patients in a setting where the probability of re-exposure is effectively nil, owing to New Zealand's successful elimination strategy. Methods A triplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype (IgG, IgM and IgA) and subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) responses against Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. After establishing baseline levels with pre-pandemic control sera (n=113), samples from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease (n=189) collected up to eight months post infection were examined. The relationship between antigen-specific antibodies and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) was explored with a surrogate neutralisation assay that quantifies inhibition of the RBD/hACE 2 interaction. Results While most individuals had broad isotype and subclass responses to each antigen shortly after infection, only RBD and S protein IgG, as well as NAbs, were stable over the study period, with 99%, 96% and 90% of samples, respectively, having responses over baseline 4-8 months post-infection. Anti-RBD antibodies were strongly correlated with NAbs at all time points (Pearsons r > 0.87) and feasibility of using finger prick sampling to accurately measure anti-RBD IgG was demonstrated. Conclusion Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist for up to eight months following mild to moderate infection.

Sentiment analysis can be enhanced through subjectivity and objectivity classification with attention mechanisms. Methods: This research includes input corpora of contrasting levels of subjectivity and objectivity from different databases to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews, incorporating attention mechanisms at the aspect level. Three large corpora are chosen as the subjectivity and objectivity datasets, the Shopee user review dataset (ShopeeRD) for subjectivity, together with the Wikipedia English dataset (Wiki-en) and Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for objectivity. Word embeddings are created using Word2Vec with Skip-Gram. Then, a bidirectional LSTM with an attention layer (LSTM-ATT) imposed on word vectors. The performance of the model is evaluated and benchmarked against classification models of Logistics Regression (LR) and Linear SVC (L-SVC). Three models are trained with subjectivity (70% of ShopeeRD) and the objectivity (Wiki-en) embeddings, with ten-fold cross-validation. Next, the three models are evaluated against two datasets (IMDb and 20% of ShopeeRD). The experiments are based on benchmark comparisons, embedding comparison and model comparison with 70-10-20 train-validation-test splits. Data augmentation using AUG-BERT is performed and selected models incorporating AUG-BERT, are compared. Results: L-SVC scored the highest accuracy with 56.9% for objective embeddings (Wiki-en) while the LSTM-ATT scored 69.0% on subjective embeddings (ShopeeRD). Improved performances were observed with data augmentation using AUG-BERT, where the LSTM-ATT+AUG-BERT model scored the highest accuracy at 60.0% for objective embeddings and 70.0% for subjective embeddings, compared to 57% (objective) and 69% (subjective) for L-SVC+AUG-BERT, and 56% (objective) and 68% (subjective) for L-SVC.

METHODS This single-center, retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent intravenous VCM therapy during PMMA-CHDF at the intensive care unit of Chiba University Hospital between 2008 and 2016. A population analysis was performed and CLhemofilter was assessed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Median body weight (BW) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were 63 kg and 15, respectively. Mean conditions for CHDF were 107.5  18.3 mL/min for blood flow rate and 26.3  6.3 mL/kg/h for effluent flow rate. The mean parameter estimates were: distribution volume of the central compartment (V1), 59.1 L; clearance of the central compartment (CL1), 1.35 L/h; distribution volume of the peripheral compartment (V2), 56.1 L; and clearance of the peripheral compartment (CL2), 3.65 L/h. BW and SOFA score were significantly associated with V1 (P < 0.05) and CL1 (P < 0.05), respectively, and were thus selected as covariates in the final model.

Approximately 543 000 (99%) travelers arriving directly from Japan at 25 US airports were screened for radiation contamination from March 17 to April 30, and no traveler was detected with contamination sufficient to require a large-scale public health response. The response highlighted synergistic collaboration across government levels and leveraged screening methods already in place at POEs, leading to rapid protocol implementation. Policy development, planning, training, and exercising response protocols and the establishment of federal authority to compel decontamination of travelers are needed for future radiological responses. Comparison of resource-intensive screening costs with the public health yield should guide policy decisions, given the historically low frequency of contaminated travelers arriving during radiological disasters.","output":"US screening of international travelers for radioactive contamination after the Japanese nuclear plant disaster in March 2011."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seroprevalence studies represent a very important tool to find out what fraction of population has already met with the new type of coronavirus (e.g. SARS-CoV-2). Without these data, it is almost impossible for the state authorities to manage the epidemic and adopt rational measures. This article brings the results of a medium-sized seroprevalence study which was carried out in the spring of 2020 in South Bohemia. In the Strakonice and Psek regions, the ELISA method was used to test the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies in 2011 subjects, volunteers from general public and selected professions working in areas with a higher exposure to the infection. The study showed that already in May 2020, 2.9% of inhabitants of the Strakonice region and 1.9% of inhabitants of the Psek region had antibodies against the coronavirus. These numbers imply that for each PCR positive person, there were at least fifty others who had probably already undergone the infection. The article points out three types of problems that might occur in such a study. First, the study must be planned correctly, and possible outcomes must be pre-assessed. Second, an appropriate test must be selected with known parameters. This enables us to correctly estimate the share of false positive and false negative results. Third, the data must be evaluated in a reasonable way and correct inference must be performed. We offer a set of recommendations how to manage these issues and how to solve problems that inevitably arise in such a large-scale testing.","output":"Exploratory drilling: how to set up, carry out, and evaluate a seroprevalence study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Individual treatment attempts (ITAs) are a German concept for the treatment of individual patients by physicians with nonstandard therapeutic approaches. ITAs span from nonstandard off-label drug uses to first-in-human uses of newly developed drugs/ interventions. Due to the lack of evidence, ITAs come with a high amount of uncertainty regarding the risk-benefit ratio. At present, no prospective review and no systematic retrospective evaluation of ITAs are required in Germany; therefore, no opportunity exists for the basic evaluation of the frequency, type, or outcomes of ITAs. Our objective was to explore stakeholders' attitudes toward the retrospective evaluation (monitoring) or prospective evaluation (review) of ITAs. Methods: We conducted a qualitative interview study among relevant stakeholder groups. We used the SWOT framework to represent the stakeholders' attitudes. We applied content analysis to the recorded and transcribed interviews in MAXQDA. Results: Twenty interviewees participated in the study. The interviewees pointed to several arguments in favor of the retrospective evaluation of ITAs, such as the knowledge gain about and setting and circumstances of ITAs. At the same time, the interviewees expressed concerns regarding the validity and practical relevance of the evaluation results. The viewpoints on review addressed several contextual factors (e.g., different medical disciplines) that should be acknowledged when judging the necessity of a review. Conclusion: One main conclusion is that the current situation with a complete lack of evaluation insufficiently reflects safety concerns. German health policy decision makers should be more explicit about where and why some sort of evaluation is needed or not needed. Another conclusion is that there is no one-size-fits-all model for evaluating ITAs. Both prospective and retrospective evaluations should be piloted in areas of ITAs with particularly high risks and conflicts of interest, such as in the application of very experimental therapies (e.g., bench-to-bedside applications) outside clinical trials.","output":"Should the governance of individual treatment attempts (''Individuelle Heilversuche '') include praxis evaluation?

The most of study on appendicitis came from sporadic patients and focused on clinical treatment rather than control and prevention of appendicitis in the population. The present study aims to investigate the epidemiological features of cluster of acute appendicitis, risk factors, and evaluate effectiveness of control and prevention in population. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal study on a cluster of acute appendicitis among Tibetan students at a high school in eastern China, which was divided into three stages: 1. We retrospectively collected epidemiological data and clinical data to explore risk factor and possible transmission route in August of 2005; 2. We conducted targeted measures from August of 2005 and analyzed incidence trend from 2000 to 2010; 3. Since no new patients occurred in 2011, we conducted surveillance from the beginning of 2012 until July 2018. RESULTS: Among 973 Tibetan students, there were 120 patients with more female patients (102 of 499, 20.4%) than male patients (18 of 474, 3.8%) from January of 2000 to December of 2010. The 4-year cumulative incidence rates in female students enrolled in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 were 26.8% (11 of 41), 27.1% (13 of 48), 44.7% (21 of 47), 42.4% (14 of 33), 23.1% (9 of 39), and 19.3% (11 of 57), respectively before their graduation. There was a clustering feature. Mutual contact with patients before the onset of symptoms was an important risk factor (Adjusted OR 4.89, 95% CI: 1.67C14.35). Transmission route may be fecal-oral infection. Before conducting targeted measures, the incidence rate increased from 2000 and peaked in 2005. After conducting targeted measures, the incidence rate decreased year by year until 2010. Under surveillance from January of 2012 to July of 2018, only four sporadic patients occurred at this school. CONCLUSION: This cluster of acute appendicitis had features of an infectious disease in epidemiology, which can be controlled and prevented by targeted measures. Our study may also be used for prevention of sporadic patients and be generalized in general population as cluster of appendicitis occurred in many provinces of China.","output":"Cluster of Acute Appendicitis Among High School Tibetan Students in Nanchang, China: Investigation, Control, and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) is angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 67 456 adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19 from the USA; 7306 from Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific between February 2020 and January 2021. RESULTS: In the US cohort, compared with patients 18C34 years old, patients 65 had a greater risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.58 to 1.90), acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS)/respiratory failure (aHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.76 to 1.96), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV, aHR 1.93, 95% CI, 1.73 to 2.15), and all-cause mortality (aHR 5.6, 95% CI 4.36 to 7.18). Men appeared to be at a greater risk for ICU admission (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.39), ARDS/respiratory failure (aHR 1.24, 95% CI1.21 to 1.27), IMV (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.45), and all-cause mortality (aHR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.24) compared with women. Moreover, we observed a greater risk of adverse outcomes during the early pandemic (ie, FebruaryCApril 2020) compared with later periods. In the ex-US cohort, the age and gender trends were similar; for the temporal trend, the highest proportion of patients with all-cause mortality were also in FebruaryCApril 2020; however, the highest percentages of patients with IMV and ARDS/respiratory failure were in AugustCOctober 2020 followed by FebruaryCApril 2020.

While ISC could reduce control of SARS-CoV-2 viremia, it might also dampen the severe immune response to the virus;data comparing ISC groups is limited. Methods: Using patient-level data from 34 sites in the U.S. National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), we compared risk of COVID-19 hospitalization amongst COVID-19 patients in 3 ISC groups (1,300 persons with HIV [PWH];2,142 solid organ transplant [SOT] patients;41 PWH with SOT) to 288,743 COVID-19 patients without HIV or SOT (HIV-/SOT-). COVID-19+ was defined by RT-PCR, antibody test, or diagnostic codes. HIV infection, SOT and comorbidities were defined by conditions/diagnostic codes within 2 years prior to first COVID-19+. Hospitalization was defined by inpatient care between 14 days prior to 45 days after the first COVID-19+. Odds ratios of hospitalization were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for demographics, study site, and comorbidities (severe liver disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and total comorbidities [0, 1, 2, 3]). Results: Of 292,226 COVID-19+ patients, the median age was 41 years (IQR: 25-58), 46% male, 47% non-Hispanic white (NHW), and 17% non-Hispanic black (NHB). PWH and SOT patients, respectively, were more likely to be older (median: 50 & 56), male (70% & 60%), and had  3 comorbidities than overall N3C patients (30% & 64% vs. 8%). PWH were more likely to be NHB (50%) and SOT patients were more likely to be NHW (41%). Overall, 26% of HIV-/ SOT- COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. In crude analyses with HIV-/SOT- as the referent group (Table), COVID-19 patients with HIV, SOT or both had a 2.3, 4.4, or 6.9-fold increased odds of hospitalization, respectively. After adjustment for demographics and site, the risk was attenuated but remained statistically significant (Model a). Sequential adjustment for the type and number of comorbidities obviated the estimated risk among PWH, while SOT patients had persistently increased odds of hospitalization (Model b). Conclusion: ISC patients (PWH and SOT) are more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 independent of demographics. However, this increased hospitalization risk was driven mainly by the high burden of comorbidities in both groups. Only SOT patients had an independent risk of hospitalization after adjusting for comorbidities. Ongoing analyses will examine the impact of ISC on additional COVID-19 outcomes (i.e. ventilation use, death).","output":"COVID-19 hospitalization among people with HIV or solid organ transplant in the us"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome sequencing has shown strong capabilities in the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic such as pathogen identification and virus preliminary tracing.

The autoantibodies isolated used different heavy- and light-chain variable region genes and carried high levels of somatic mutations in complementary-determining regions, consistent with antigenic selection. Remarkably, binding to DSG3 was lost when somatic mutations were reverted to the germline sequence. These findings identify the cis-adhesive interface of DSG3 as the immunodominant region targeted by pathogenic antibodies in PV and indicate that autoreactivity relies on somatic mutations generated in the response to an antigen unrelated to DSG3.","output":"Pemphigus autoantibodies generated through somatic mutations target the desmoglein-3 cis-interface."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective of this paper is two-fold: first, we assess the likely impact of the corona crisis on the economic and societal choices of people, especially in relation to voluntary simplicity Second, we contextualise the impact of those choices in the field of innovation management Taking a normative-conceptual perspective we seek to understand in how far frugality, and inter alia, frugal innovations can play a role in better managing the after-effects of the corona crisis and what implications arise out of this for the relevant societal stakeholders Frugality is likely to emerge as a mega-trend that may shape a frugal 'affordable green excellence' (AGE) as the dominant innovation paradigm To realise this potential, however, it is necessary for frugal innovators and entrepreneurs to develop a more comprehensive and multidimensional understanding of affordability that is targeted at ensuring financial, societal, infrastructural and ecological affordability of frugal products, services, technologies and business models","output":"Opportunities of frugality in the post-corona era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Passive immunotherapy using hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) to SARS-CoV-2, derived from recovered donors, is a potential rapidly available, specific therapy for an outbreak infection such as SARS-CoV-2. Findings from randomised clinical trials of hIVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 are limited. METHODS: In this international randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who had been symptomatic for up to 12 days and did not have acute end-organ failure were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either hIVIG or an equivalent volume of saline as placebo, in addition to remdesivir, when not contraindicated, and other standard clinical care. Randomisation was stratified by site pharmacy; schedules were prepared using a mass-weighted urn design. Infusions were prepared and masked by trial pharmacists; all other investigators, research staff, and trial participants were masked to group allocation. Follow-up was for 28 days. The primary outcome was measured at day 7 by a seven-category ordinal endpoint that considered pulmonary status and extrapulmonary complications and ranged from no limiting symptoms to death. Deaths and adverse events, including organ failure and serious infections, were used to define composite safety outcomes at days 7 and 28. Prespecified subgroup analyses were carried out for efficacy and safety outcomes by duration of symptoms, the presence of anti-spike neutralising antibodies, and other baseline factors. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received all or part of the assigned study product infusion. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04546581. FINDINGS: From Oct 8, 2020, to Feb 10, 2021, 593 participants (n=301 hIVIG, n=292 placebo) were enrolled at 63 sites in 11 countries; 579 patients were included in the mITT analysis. Compared with placebo, the hIVIG group did not have significantly greater odds of a more favourable outcome at day 7; the adjusted OR was 106 (95% CI 077C145; p=072). Infusions were well tolerated, although infusion reactions were more common in the hIVIG group (186% vs 95% for placebo; p=0002). The percentage with the composite safety outcome at day 7 was similar for the hIVIG (24%) and placebo groups (25%; OR 098, 95% CI 066C146; p=091). The ORs for the day 7 ordinal outcome did not vary for subgroups considered, but there was evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect for the day 7 composite safety outcome: risk was greater for hIVIG compared with placebo for patients who were antibody positive (OR 221, 95% CI 114C429); for patients who were antibody negative, the OR was 051 (029C090; p(interaction)=0001). INTERPRETATION: When administered with standard of care including remdesivir, SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG did not demonstrate efficacy among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 without end-organ failure. The safety of hIVIG might vary by the presence of endogenous neutralising antibodies at entry.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 222 pregnant women who were referred to Kamali Hospital in Alborz province in 2020. The eligible individuals entered the study through convenience sampling, and data were collected using five questionnaires including the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Anxiety of COVID-19 Scale, the pregnancy experiences Scales, Depression Anxiety Stress scale, and demographic checklist. The obtained data were then analyzed using SPSS-16 and Amos software. RESULTS: According to results of the path analysis, the anxiety of COVID-19 and concerns during pregnancy were variables that were positively and significantly correlated with mental health only through one path, which was direct, and anxiety of COVID-19 had also the highest positive direct correlation among them (B = 0.32).

Zonisamide (ZNS) was originally developed as an antiepileptic drug. Studies have shown that ZNS suppresses ER stress-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Herein, we investigated whether ZNS improved DCM by attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis. C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneally injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and then treated with ZNS (40 mgkg-1d-1, i.g.) for 16 weeks. We showed that ZNS administration slightly ameliorated the blood glucose levels, but significantly alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. Furthermore, ZNS administration significantly inhibited the Bax and caspase-3 activity, upregulated Bcl-2 activity, and decreased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells in heart tissues. We analyzed the hallmarks of ER stress in heart tissues, and revealed that ZNS administration significantly decreased the protein levels of GRP78, XBP-1s, ATF6, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP, and elevated Hrd1 protein. In high glucose (HG)-treated primary cardiomyocytes, application of ZNS (3 M) significantly alleviated HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. ZNS application also suppressed activated ER stress in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, preapplication of the specific ER stress inducer tunicamycin (10 ng/mL) eliminated the protective effects of ZNS against HG-induced cardiac hypertrophy and ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that ZNS improves the cardiac diastolic function in diabetic mice and prevents T2DM-induced cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating ER stress-mediated apoptosis.","output":"Zonisamide, an antiepileptic drug, alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On April 1st, 2020, COVID-19 surpassed tuberculosis regarding the number of deaths per day worldwide.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who fulfilled regional criteria and underwent primary LRYGB from 2018 to 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were discharged on the morning of the first postoperative day (POD1) after meeting the predefined criteria. The assessed outcome measures (POD1 vital signs, laboratory findings, pain scores and nausea/vomiting) and 30-day postoperative complications were compared between the early (stay  24 h) and delayed (>24 h) groups. RESULTS: For 107 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 48 (44.9%) were discharged within 24 h. There were no differences in the baseline demographics, except that the early group was more likely to have a previous abdominal operation (35.4% vs. 16.9%). Both groups had similar operation durations (89 min vs. 92 min), but the early group had a markedly shortened length of stay (23 (24C22) h vs. 27 (47C26) h). The POD1 parameters were the same between the groups, except that the delay group had a significantly higher visual analog scale score, with fewer patient scores of 0. Patients who were younger and female were more likely to need additional IV analgesics. No POD1 antiemesis was required throughout the study. There was no increase in the 30-day complications. CONCLUSION: Patient discharge at 24 h post-LRYGB is feasible and safe in a low-volume practice. A more comprehensive pain relief strategy may be required before generalizing this approach.

Subsequently, we tested causality by using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. Results: In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) is associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.80 (0.69, 0.93) and 0.74 (0.58, 0.95), respectively.

We aim to study the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of pediatric hospital services including emergency department (ED) attendances, hospitalizations, diagnostic categories and resource utilization in Singapore. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of ED attendances and hospital admissions among children < 18 years old from January 1st to August 8th 2020 in a major pediatric hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed in the following time periods: Pre-lockdown (divided by the change in Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level), during-lockdown and post-lockdown. We presented the data using proportions and percentage change in mean counts per day with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We attended to 58,367 children with a mean age of 5.1 years (standard deviation, SD 4.6). The mean ED attendance decreased by 331 children/day during lockdown compared to baseline (p < 0.001), attributed largely to a drop in respiratory (% change ? 87.9, 95% CI ? 89.3 to ? 86.3, p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal infections (% change ? 72.4, 95%CI ? 75.9 to ? 68.4, p < 0.001). Trauma-related diagnoses decreased at a slower rate across the same periods (% change ? 40.0, 95%CI ? 44.3 to ? 35.3, p < 0.001). We saw 226 children with child abuse, with a greater proportion of total attendance seen post-lockdown (79, 0.6%) compared to baseline (36, 0.2%) (p < 0.001). In terms of ED resource utilization, there was a decrease in the overall mean number of procedures performed per day during the lockdown compared to baseline, driven largely by a reduction in blood investigations (% change ? 73.9, 95%CI ? 75.9 to ? 71.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a significant decrease in infection-related presentations likely attributed to the lockdown and showed that the relative proportion of trauma-related attendances increased.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but instrument costs are high and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses orthogonal and often less expensive reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however, a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, which complicates detection. RESULTS: Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. To optimize beacons for RT-LAMP, multiple locked nucleic acid monomers were incorporated to elevate melting temperatures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in \\"single pot\\" reactions, including incorporation of a human RNA LAMP-BEAC assay to confirm sample integrity. Comparison of LAMP-BEAC and RT-qPCR on clinical saliva samples showed good concordance between assays. To facilitate implementation, we developed custom polymerases for LAMP-BEAC and inexpensive purification procedures, which also facilitates increasing sensitivity by increasing reaction volumes. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP-BEAC thus provides an affordable and simple SARS-CoV-2 RNA assay suitable for population screening; implementation of the assay has allowed robust screening of thousands of saliva samples per week.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-LAMP and molecular beacons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) outside of the ICU has played an important role in the management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods Between January 2020 and May 2021, data of severely to critically ill COVID-19 patients were extracted from seven hospitals of the Catholic Medical Center through a clinical data warehouse. Corticosteroid use was subcategorized into total cumulative dose, early 7-day dose, mean daily dose, and duration of use. Results A total of 2,427 patients were screened, and 218 patients were included. CAPA was diagnosed in 4.6% (10/218) of all hospitalized and 11.2% (10/89) of intensive care unit patients. Total cumulative dose (over 1,000 mg as methylprednisolone) and daily high-dose corticosteroid use (over 60 mg/day) were independent predictors but not early 7-day high-dose corticosteroid use (over 420 mg/week) (odds ratio [OR], 1.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.350 to 8.571) nor prolonged use (OR, 2.794; 95% CI, 0.635 to 13.928). In-hospital overall mortality was 11.9% (26 of 218). CAPA itself did not affect the outcome; rather, daily high-dose steroid use significantly increased the 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 5.645; 95% CI, 1.225 to 26.091). Conclusions CAPA was not uncommon, especially in critically ill patients. Daily high-dose corticosteroid use was the predictor of CAPA and associated with high mortality rates.

Methods We included patients admitted to a referral center in Cali, Colombia between April and August 2020. Patients were evaluated for demographics, severity of disease, comorbidities, clinical outcomes, delirium and survival at discharge. We evaluated the association of patient characteristics and disease factors with delirium incidence by multivariate analysis (Hosmer and Lemeshow) and the associations of delirium with functional outcome at discharge Results Among 333 patients, 58 (17.42%. 95% CI: 13.62C21.77%) presented delirium 16 (IQR: 11 ? 20) days after symptom onset. Patients with delirium were older, reported muscular weakness more often, had a higher NEWS2 score at admission, and had more comorbidities (mainly Diabetes Mellitus II). Multivariate analysis of hospitalization events and treatments found mechanical ventilation as the only significant covariate. The association between need for mechanical ventilation and delirium development was estimated at OR = 11.72, (95%CI = 4.16C34.23).

Our results revealed different vertical bacterial and archaeal richness patterns: bacterial richness was lowest in the deep soil layer and peaked in the surface or middle soil layer. In contrast, archaeal richness did not differ among soil layers. PERMANOVA analysis indicated that both bacterial and archaeal community compositions were significantly impacted by soil depth but unaffected by sampling time. Notably, the proportion of rare bacteria gradually decreased along with the soil profile. The rare bacterial community composition was the most important indicator for soil nutrient fertility index, as determined by random forest analysis.

Therefore, we analyzed the impact of social distancing and loneliness in suicidal ideation. METHODS: We performed two waves of a snowball sample, web-based survey in Brazil (W1: from May 6th to June 6th, 2020; W2: from June 6th to July 6th, 2020). We assessed whether risk factors related to social relationships (loneliness, living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing) at W1 were associated with suicidal ideation at W1 and W2 using multiple regression models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, mental health, and lifestyle variables. RESULTS: A total of 1,674 (18-75 years old; 86.5% females) were included in our longitudinal sample. Living alone (OR: 1.16; 95%CI = 1.03 - 1.30; p=0.015), number of days practicing social distancing (OR: 1.002; 95%CI = 1.000 - 1.004; p=0.027), and loneliness (OR: 1.49; 95%CI = 1.32 - 1.68; p<0.001) were associated with suicidal ideation in the cross-sectional analysis of W1. Only loneliness (OR= 2.12; 95%CI = 1.06 - 4.24; p = 0.033) remained significant as a risk factor to suicidal ideation in the longitudinal analysis between both waves.

Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\\\\frac{\\\\text{kcal}}{\\\\text{mol}\\\\cdot \\\\text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\\\\frac{\\\\text{kcal}}{\\\\text{mol}\\\\cdot \\\\text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\\\\frac{\\\\text{kcal}}{\\\\text{mol}\\\\cdot \\\\text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD).

As caregivers play an integral role for patients with terminal illness, it is necessary to assess their perceptions and attitudes towards the palliative care approach. METHOD A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data was collected from the Aga Khan Hospital in-patient and out-patient departments and home-based palliative care services. All adult caregivers who met the inclusion criteria and consented, completed a questionnaire till the sample size was reached. Univariate and multivariate multivariable analysis was done and results were reported as crude prevalence's, crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Cox-proportional hazard algorithm. Mean difference of knowledge and attitude scores by caregiver variables were assessed using one-way ANOVA. SPSS version 18 was used and a p-value of less than 5% was treated as significant. RESULTS Out of 250 caregivers more than 60% were 40 years or less, majority were males and at least graduates. Approximately 70% of the respondents agreed with the statement that the person suffering from cancer should be informed about the diagnosis and disease progression. About 45% (95% C.I.: 39.03, 51.37%) of the study respondents had enhanced understanding about palliative care. Individuals under 40 years old, those with an education level of at least grade 10, children or relatives were found to have significantly more enhanced knowledge about palliative care. The majority believed that the patient should be informed about the diagnosis and should be facilitated to carry out routine activities and fulfill their wishes. CONCLUSION Nearly half of the caregivers had enhanced understanding of the palliative care approach. They showed consistent understanding of two foundational aspects indicating correct knowledge across age groups, gender, education level, and relationship with the patient. Firstly, that palliative care should be offered to everyone suffering from a terminal illness and, secondly, that this approach encompasses not just physical, but also psychological and social needs of the patient and the family.

Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time;($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being.

Increasingly volatile weather and more extreme events such as droughts can reduce crop productivity. This implies the need for significant increases in production and the adoption of more efficient and sustainable production methods and adaptation to climate change. A new technological and environment-friendly management technique to improve the tolerance of quinoa grown to maturity is proposed using native microbial biostimulants (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; AMF) alone, in the consortium, or in combination with compost (Comp) as an organic matter source under two water treatments (normal irrigation and drought stress (DS)). Compared with controls, growth, grain yield, and all physiological traits under DS were significantly decreased while hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and antioxidative enzymatic functions were significantly increased. Under DS, biofertilizer application reverted physiological activities to normal levels and potentially strengthened quinoas adaptability to water shortage as compared to untreated plants. The dual combination yielded a 97% improvement in grain dry weight. Moreover, the effectiveness of microbial and compost biostimulants as a biological tool improves grain quality and limits soil degradation under DS. Elemental concentrations, particularly macronutrients, antioxidant potential (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity), and bioactive compounds (phenol and flavonoid content), were accumulated at higher levels in biofertilizer-treated quinoa grain than in untreated controls. The effects of AMF + Comp on post-harvest soil fertility traits were the most positive, with significant increases in total phosphorus (47%) and organic matter (200%) content under drought conditions. Taken together, our data demonstrate that drought stress strongly influences the physiological traits, yield, and quality of quinoa. Microbial and compost biostimulation could be an effective alternative to ensure greater recovery capability, thereby maintaining relatively high levels of grain production. Our study shows that aboveground stress responses in quinoa can be modulated by signals from the microbial/compost-treated root. Further, quinoa grains are generally of higher nutritive quality when amended and inoculated with AMF as compared to non-inoculated and compost-free plants.","output":"Root Reinforcement Improved Performance, Productivity, and Grain Bioactive Quality of Field-Droughted Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 27-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) was transported to the regional university hospital in gestational week (GW) 34 + 4 due to a three-day history of fever, abdominal pain and reduced foetal movements.

Transmission models were fit to each virus to estimate the magnitude reduction in transmission due to weather-related disruptions. Changes in contact rates and care-seeking were informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital visits. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16 to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3 to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in an early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.

METHODS: 50 caregivers were divided into two groups: \\"Caregiver-focused group\\" (Cg) and \\"Patient-focused group\\" (Pg). Both groups received telephone contact every 2 weeks over a 28-week period, but the content of the call was different: in Cg, caregivers answered questions about the state of the PWD but also explored their own emotional state, stress burden, and quality of life.

Moreover, Impact on Event Scale values improved over the weeks in Cg (pa=a0.015), while they remained unchanged in Pg (pa=a0.483). CONCLUSION: Caregivers who received telephone support about their mood and stress burden did not worsen their psychological state during the time of intervention, as did instead those who did not get such support.","output":"Caregiver Tele-Assistance for Reduction of Emotional Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Many of the nearly 60,000 newly diagnosed patients with HNSCC in the US-and 900,000 worldwide-will undergo a PET scan, if not multiple, throughout the course of their care. In this review, we describe the clinical utility of PET scans in HNSCC, emphasizing whereby their input is most impactful in improving patient outcomes as well as scenarios whereby PET/CT scans should be avoided. We also describe important considerations for capturing and processing PET scans with a special focus on the important role of tumor volume segmentation, scan timing relative to therapy, and concurrent conditions (eg, COVID-19). In addition, we will illustrate the latest innovations in the management of HNSCC. This article also will delve to exhibit novel potential biomarkers in the management of HNSCC.

Depletion of Mbd2 in macrophages protected mice against BLM-induced PF. Mbd2 deficiency significantly attenuated transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF-?1) production and reduced M2 macrophage accumulation in the lung following BLM induction. Mechanistically, Mbd2 selectively bound to the Ship promoter in macrophages, by which it repressed Ship expression and enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling to promote macrophage M2 program. Therefore, intratracheal administration of liposomes loaded with Mbd2 siRNA protected mice from BLM-induced lung injuries and fibrosis. Together, our data support that MBD2 could be a viable target against pulmonary fibrosis in clinical settings.","output":"MBD2 serves as a viable target against pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting macrophage M2 program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) IgA antibodies correlate with secretory anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and contribute to virus neutralization, we planned an observational study to measure serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgAs kinetics throughout a 6-month period in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine recipients. Methods: : The study sample consisted of 97 baseline SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthcare workers (median age 42 years and IQR 31-52 years;52 females), who underwent vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA-based vaccine (two 30 g doses, 21 days apart). Serum samples were collected at baseline, before the second vaccine dose (i.e., day 21), and then 51, 111 and 201 days after enrolment (i.e., 1, 3 and 6 months after the second vaccine dose). Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit IgA were measured with Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgA (Euroimmun, Lbeck, Germany). Results: : Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit IgA displayed a peak at 1 month after the second vaccine dose, but then progressively waned afterwards. The 6-month serum anti-spike S1 subunit IgA concentration was 71% lower than the peak concentration. The rate of subjects with positive IgA values was 0% at baseline, 80.4% at day 21, 97.9% at day 51, but then declined to 73.2% and 53.6% at 3 and 6 months after the second vaccine dose. Serum anti-spike S1 subunit IgAs measured at 111 and 201 days was significantly lower than at the 51-day peak (both p<0.001). Significant inverse correlation was found between anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies decline at 6 months/ and recipients age (r=-0.24;p=0.019). Conclusion: These findings may provide possible explanation to decreased efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection 6 months after vaccination.","output":"Six-month decline of

an increased morbidity to virus infections as well as a delay in clearance of symptoms after infection. Studies of sublethal virus infections of aged mice closely mirror the human situation: there is a delay in clearance of virus. The delay in virus clearance is accompanied by a delay and a decrease in T-cell response, particularly of CD8(+) T cells. Intrinsic alterations of T cells of aged mice contribute to this decrease in virus-specific T-cell response; however, evidence suggests that environmental or innate components of the aged host also influence this age-associated decline in clearance of virus. While the changes in the adaptive immune response have been carefully described, the early events in the generation of the T-cell response after virus infection have received limited attention. Importantly, age-associated changes in the innate response to virus infection, particularly production of and response to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta, cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production by natural killer cells, interleukin-12 induction, and depletion of non-specific T cells early during virus infection need further evaluation.","output":"Response of aged mice to primary virus infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with COVID-19 have been reported to experience gastrointestinal symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms, but the effects of COVID-19 on the gut microbiota are poorly understood.

As health care organizations move from crisis mobilization to a new landscape of health and social needs, organizational health literacy offers practical building blocks to provide high-quality, efficient, and meaningful care to patients and their families. Organizational health literacy is defined by the Institute of Medicine as \\"the degree to which an organization implements policies, practices, and systems that make it easier for people to navigate, understand, and use information and services to take care of their health.\\" METHODS This article synthesizes insights from organizational health literacy in the context of current major health care challenges and toward the goal of innovation in patient-centered care. We first provide a brief overview of the origins and outlines of organizational health literacy research and practice. Second, using an established patient-centered innovation framework, we show how the existing work on organizational health literacy can offer a menu of effective, patient-centered innovative options for care delivery systems to improve systems and outcomes. Finally, we consider the high value of management focusing on organizational health literacy efforts, specifically for patients in health care transitions and in the rapid transformation of care into myriad distance modalities. RESULTS This article provides practical guidance for systems and informs decisions around resource allocation and organizational priorities to best meet the needs of patient populations even in the face of financial and workforce disruption. CONCLUSIONS Organizational health literacy principles and guidelines provide a road map for promoting patient-centered care even in this time of crisis, change, and transformation.

METHODS An online survey (August 2020) was performed on individuals aged 20-64 years living in Japan who had taken oral or inhalant antivirals for influenza treatment in the 2018/19 or 2019/20 seasons. Efficacy and safety were assumed to be equivalent among the antivirals. The attributes for the conjoint analysis included route (oral or inhalant), duration, frequency of administration, and out-of-pocket expenses. A conditional logit model was applied as a baseline model. The monetary value of each attribute was calculated by comparing the same utility of the linearly interpolated level of the out-of-pocket attribute. Another survey to determine the experiences of the latest antiviral intake was also conducted on the same respondents. RESULTS Of the respondents, 1,550 were men and 1,587 women. The monetary value for oral antivirals was estimated to be higher, saving JPY 741 (USD 7.06, as of August 2020), compared with inhalant. Regarding the length and frequency of administration, five days corresponds to an increase of JPY 2,072, compared with one day, and twice a day corresponds to a JPY 574 increase compared to once a day society. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that-among the antivirals approved in Japan-the monetary value of the utility is the highest in the single dose oral antiviral, baloxavir marboxil (baloxavir). Although the drug cost was highest in baloxavir among the brand antivirals, the difference in the value of utility for influenza patient was estimated to be larger than the difference in the drug costs.

METHODS: To identify malaria hotspots and analyze the pattern of distribution, we used the optimized hotspots toolset and spatial autocorrelation respectively in ArcGIS 10.3 for desktop. We also used Pearsons Correlation analysis to identify associative environmental factors using the R-software 3.4.1. RESULTS: The spatial distribution of malaria showed statistically significant clustered pattern for the year 2000 and 2015 with Morans indexes 0.126 (P < 0.001) and 0.187 (P < 0.001) respectively.

After adjustment for covariates, night work and BMI > 30 were associated with a markedly greater risk of COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 3.049 [95%CI 1.260C7.380] and OR 7.15 [95%CI 2.91C17.51], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results describe a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a central Italian COVID Hospital.

Chloroquine is a anti-malaria drug that is frequently employed for COVID-19 treatment since it inhibits SARS-CoV-2 spread in the kidney-derived cell line Vero1-3. Here, we show that engineered expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular protease that activates SARS-CoV-2 for entry into lung cells4, renders SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells insensitive to chloroquine. Moreover, we report that chloroquine does not block SARS-CoV-2 infection of the TMPRSS2-positive lung cell line Calu-3.

Particularly, how would China foster its image in Asia and, as a result, earn a favorable voice and even all-out support from Asian countries, countries economically underdeveloped and politically volatile? This paper sets out to answer this question by critiquing whether or not popular perceptions of China's political system impact how Asians perceive China's influence in general. Conducting statistical analysis using the fourth wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2016) to assess the above argument, we find that Asians who lend their support for China are more keen to the economic opportunities that China's growing economy offers their country than they are of China's political system.

This cohort study aimed to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of these devices during transgastric peritoneoscopy. METHODS Ten morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in the study. Following laparoscopic access, transgastric peritoneal access was established using the SFT and RAN, and transgastric peritoneoscopy performed. NOTES adhesiolysis was performed in 2 patients with significant intra-abdominal adhesions due to prior surgery. Outcome measures included time to enter the peritoneal cavity, ability to visualize each quadrant of the abdomen, ability to perform adhesiolysis, and complications. RESULTS Ten patients with a median body mass index as stated in table 1 of 47.5 kg/m(2) were enrolled. Successful transgastric access was achieved in 8 of the 10 patients. One procedure was aborted because of difficulty creating the gastrotomy. Another procedure was aborted because of the difficult passage of the device through the oropharynx.

This qualitative paper aims to identify factors influencing uptake among those offered daily testing, and the subsequent impact on behaviour. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 52 participants who had taken part in the feasibility study. Participants were asked about their experiences of daily testing or self-isolating, their reasons for choosing to test or isolate, and their behaviour during the study period. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Results are presented under two main headings: (1) factors influencing acceptance of testing and (2) impact of test results. Participants appeared highly motivated to engage in behaviours that would protect others from the virus. Factors influencing the decision to accept testing included (1) needing to avoid self-isolation, (2) concerns about test sensitivity, and (3) perceived benefits of detecting infection. Participants who were taking tests reported: (1) positive consequences following confirmation of COVID status, (2) engaging in essential activities, (3) uncertainty, and (4) self-isolating whilst testing. Conclusions: This study has identified a range of factors that appear to influence the decision to engage in daily testing or to self-isolate following close contact with a positive case, many of which could be addressed by clear communications. Covid-19 infection rates and government restrictions influenced experiences, and so further research is needed to explore perceptions of daily testing and behaviour following close contact with a positive case among a wider range of individuals, in the context of lower rates of COVID-19, few government restrictions on general population behaviour and more widespread testing.","output":"Engagement With Daily Testing Instead of Self-Isolating in Contacts of Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2: A Qualitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Turkey on March 10, 2020 and the number of the patients are increasing day by day Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has high mortality rates in the intensive care unit (ICU) We aimed to describe the demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, treatment protocols and clinical outcomes among the critically ill patients admitted to ICU of our hospital MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 103 consecutive patients who was laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and admitted to ICU of XXXXX Hospital between March 19 and April 13, 2020 The final date of the follow-up was April 18 RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69 614 1 years Most of the patients had increased CRP (99%), serum ferritin (73 8%), D-dimer (82 5%) and hs-troponin levels (38 8%) 34 patients (33%) had lymphocytopenia, 24 patients (23 3%) had thrombocytopenia 63 patients (61 2%) developed ARDS, 31 patients (30 1%) had acute kidney injury and 52 patients (50 5%) had MODS during follow-up 62 patients (60 2%) received mechanical ventilation As of April 18, of the 103 patients, 52 (50 5%) had died, 30 (29 1%) had been discharged from the ICU, 21 (20 4%) were still in the ICU CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 has high mortality rates in ICU Patients with elevated procalcitonin, hs-troponin, d-dimer and CRP levels and lower platelet count at admission has higher mortality","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 in Sakarya, Turkey: A Single Center Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: To counteract the spread of COVID, many companies opted for teleworking and thus reduce the number of people exposed.

High-risk patients received SARS-CoV-2 test and low-risk patients were evaluated by a clinician and selectively tested based on clinician judgment. Multivariate analyses tested whether risk factors and additional variables were associated with test positivity. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of testing positive was associated with COVID-19-positive or suspect close contact (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.10), large gathering attendance with a COVID-19-positive individual (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.10-3.34), and, with the largest effect size, decreased taste/smell (aOR 2.83, 95% CI 2.01-3.99).

This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2 RAD for testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples in comparison with the RT-PCR tests and viral culture for detecting viable virus. METHODS: One hundred seventeen nasopharyngeal swab specimens and 73 saliva samples with positive results on RT-PCR were used. Residual samples were assayed using a commercially available RAD test immediately, and its positivity was determined at various time points during the clinical course. The concordance between 54 nasopharyngeal swab samples and saliva samples that were collected simultaneously was determined. Viral culture was performed on 117 samples and compared with the results of the RAD test. RESULTS: The positive rate of RAD test using saliva samples was low throughout the clinical course. Poor concordance was observed between nasopharyngeal swab specimens and saliva samples (75.9%, kappa coefficient 0.310).

Dogs can scent-identify the unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during infection by interrogating specimens or, ideally, the body of a patient. After training 6 dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 by scent in human respiratory secretions (in vitro diagnosis), we retrained 5 of them to search and find the infection by scenting the patient directly (in vivo screening). Then, efficacy trials were designed to compare the diagnostic performance of the dogs against that of the rRT-PCR in 848 human subjects: 269 hospitalized patients (COVID-19 prevalence 30.1%), 259 hospital staff (prevalence 2.7%), and 320 government employees (prevalence 1.25%). The limit of detection in vitro was lower than 10(?12) copies ssRNA/mL. During in vivo efficacy experiments, our 5 dogs detected 92 COVID-19 positive patients among the 848 study subjects. The alert (lying down) was immediate, with 95.2% accuracy and high sensitivity (95.9%; 95% C.I. 93.6C97.4), specificity (95.1%; 94.4C95.8), positive predictive value (69.7%; 65.9C73.2), and negative predictive value (99.5%; 99.2C99.7) in relation to rRT-PCR.

Objective To evaluate the rates of cesarean delivery for nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) births in California in the context of a statewide multifaceted intervention designed to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational study of cesarean delivery rates from 2014 to 2019 among 7 574 889 NTSV births in the US and at 238 nonmilitary hospitals providing maternity services in California. From 2016 to 2019, California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative partnered with Smart Care California to implement multiple approaches to decrease the rates of cesarean delivery. Hospitals with rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births were invited to join 1 of 3 cohorts for an 18-month quality improvement collaborative between July 2016 and June 2019. Exposures Within the collaborative, multidisciplinary teams implemented multiple strategies supported by mentorship, shared learning, and rapid-cycle data feedback. Partnerships among nonprofit organizations, state governmental agencies, purchasers, and health plans addressed the external environment through transparency, award programs, and incentives. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the change in cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California and a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to compare cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California vs the rates in the rest of the US. A mixed multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level confounders also was used to assess the collaborative and the external statewide actions. The cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births at hospitals participating in the collaborative were compared with the rates from the nonparticipating hospitals and the rates in the participating hospitals prior to participation in the collaborative. Results A total of 7 574 889 NTSV births occurred in the US from 2014 to 2019, of which 914 283 were at 238 hospitals in California. All California hospitals were exposed to the statewide actions to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery, including the 149 hospitals that had baseline rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births, of which 91 (61%) participated in the quality improvement collaborative. The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California decreased from 26.0% (95% CI, 25.8%-26.2%) in 2014 to 22.8% (95% CI, 22.6%-23.1%) in 2019 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89). The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in the US (excluding California births) was 26.0% in both 2014 and 2019 (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.996-1.005). The difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.5%) higher than in the US (excluding California). Compared with the hospitals and the periods not exposed to the collaborative activities, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and time using a modified stepped-wedge analysis, exposure to collaborative activities was associated with a lower odds of cesarean delivery for NTSV births (24.4% vs 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85-0.89]). Conclusions and Relevance In this observational study of NTSV births in California from 2014 to 2019, the rates of cesarean delivery decreased over time in the setting of the implementation of a coordinated hospital-level collaborative and statewide initiatives designed to support vaginal birth.","output":"Hospital Quality Improvement Interventions, Statewide Policy Initiatives, and Rates of Cesarean Delivery for Nulliparous, Term, Singleton, Vertex Births in California."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW New developments in mechanical ventilation have focused on increasing the patient's control of the ventilator by implementing information on lung mechanics and respiratory drive. Effort-adapted modes of assisted breathing are presented and their potential advantages are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Adaptive support ventilation, proportional assist ventilation with load adjustable gain factors and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist are ventilatory modes that follow the concept of adapting the assist to a defined target, instantaneous changes in respiratory drive or lung mechanics. Improved patient ventilator interaction, sufficient unloading of the respiratory muscles and increased comfort have been recently associated with these ventilator modalities. There are, however, scarce data with regard to outcome improvement, such as length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay or mortality (commonly accepted targets to demonstrate clinical superiority). SUMMARY Within recent years, a major step forward in the evolution of assisted (effort-adapted) modes of mechanical ventilation was accomplished. There is growing evidence that supports the physiological concept of closed-loop effort-adapted assisted modes of mechanical ventilation. However, at present, the translation into a clear outcome benefit remains to be proven. In order to fill the knowledge gap that impedes the broader application, larger randomized controlled trials are urgently needed. However, with clearly proven drawbacks of conventional assisted modes such as pressure support ventilation, it is probably about time to leave these modes introduced decades ago behind.","output":"Effort-adapted modes of assisted breathing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has devastated the world of work, particularly labour Worldwide economic crises and unemployment present a difficult road ahead in ensuring the sound health and productivity of labour Among developing countries, India has been at the centre stage of this catastrophe, with millions of labourers suddenly losing their jobs and in desperate need of livelihoods to survive Emergency policy measures undertaken to sustain industrial growth in the crises may not be comforting to the labour in India in the long run This paper is intended to help policymakers and the civil engineering community in meeting the urgency of resolving the adverse impacts of the Covid-19 crisis","output":"Briefing: Grim future of work and labour after the 2020 pandemic, with reference to India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1186/s40545-020-00219-1.].","output":"Correction to: Amid COVID-19: the importance of developing an positive adverse drug reaction (ADR) and medical device incident (MDI) reporting culture for Global Health and public safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We investigated the association of LTVV with mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a national observational study in COVID-19 patients in the first wave of the pandemic. We compared COVID-19 patients that received LTVV, defined as controlled ventilation with a median tidal volume  6 mL/kg predicted body weight over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation, with patients that did not receive LTVV. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. In addition, we identified factors associated with use of LTVV. RESULTS: Of 903 patients, 294 (32.5%) received LTVV. Disease severity scores and ARDS classification was not different between the two patient groups. The primary endpoint, 28-day mortality, was met in 68 out of 294 patients (23.1%) that received LTVV versus in 193 out of 609 patients (31.7%) that did not receive LTVV (P < 0.001). LTVV was independently associated with 28-day mortality (HR, 0.68 (0.45 to 0.95); P = 0.025).

CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients, approximately a third of patients received LTVV. Use of LTVV was independently associated with reduced 28-day mortality. The initial tidal volume and continuous muscle paralysis were potentially modifiable factors associated with use of LTVV.

Additional objectives were to reveal the causes and types of cyberbullying that university students from East and Southeast Asia have experienced because of COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between cyberbullying and self-esteem. Of the 525 university students from different East and Southeast Asian countries and varied academic backgrounds who were invited to participate in the study, 310 students agreed and were included. Moreover, a sample of 400 Jordanian undergraduate students, who participated in cyberbullying against East and Southeast Asian students on social media, answered a questionnaire to reveal their reasons for engaging in bullying during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also examined the relationship and differences between sex and nationality. The findings revealed that cyberbullying contributed to low self-esteem in students of East and Southeast Asian descent who were victims of bullying. Men were more likely to be bullies and cyberbullies than women. The bullies admitted that the main reason for cyberbullying was humor, and that they were unaware that their harsh or aggressive behaviors could be categorized as bullying.

Nine semi-structured interviews with social marketing academics and practitioners from six different countries were conducted. Thematic analysis was used to analyse and interpret the qualitative data. The study provides insight into existing challenges for social marketing, classified into three key themes according to their position within or outside of the discipline: 1) poor branding of the discipline as an internal challenge, 2) competing disciplines as an external challenge, and 3) overall reach of the discipline, seen as both an internal and external challenge. The findings suggest that social marketing needs to overcome poor branding issues to sufficiently address external challenges. We conclude by arguing for a more robust marketing of the discipline. While scholars have identified the challenges and opportunities for social marketing as a discipline, they have paid little attention to examining these challenges from the viewpoint of expert practitioners and academics.

An imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation has been proposed as the mechanism of PAH. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin (Ang) II into the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), has been shown to be an important regulator of blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Herein we hypothesized diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, could ameliorate the development of PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Methods: A murine model of PAH was established using left pneumonectomy (PNx) on day 0 followed by injection of a single dose of the VEGF receptor-2 inhibitor SU5416 (25 mg/kg) subcutaneously on day 1. All hemodynamic and biochemical measurements were done at the end of the study on day 42. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 6C8/group): (1) sham-operated group, (2) vehicle-treatment group (SuPNx(42)), (3) early treatment group (SuPNx(42)/DIZE(1?42)) with DIZE at 15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously from day 1 to day 42, and (4) late treatment group (SuPNx(42)/DIZE(29?42)) with DIZE from days 29C42. Results: In both the early and late treatment groups, DIZE significantly attenuated the mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary arteriolar remodeling, and right ventricle brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), as well as reversed the overexpression of ACE while up-regulating the expression of Ang-(1-7) when compared with the vehicle-treatment group. In addition, the early treatment group also significantly decreased plasma BNP and increased the expression of eNOS. Conclusions: ACE2 activator has therapeutic potentials for preventing and attenuating the development of PAH in an animal model of left pneumonectomy combined with VEGF inhibition. Activation of ACE2 may thus be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human PAH.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Activator Ameliorates Severe Pulmonary Hypertension in a Rat Model of Left Pneumonectomy Combined With VEGF Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Oral cancer may strongly impair patients quality of life. Huge efforts have been made during recent decades in trying to improve the treatment outcomes in terms of patients survival, self-perception, and satisfaction. Consequently, the investigation into health-related quality of life (HRQOL) became an established and worldwide practice. Hundreds of studies tried to clarify which could be the most important variables that impact HRQOL in head and neck cancer patients. However, such a complex topic may be influenced by a multitude of interconnected aspects and several controversies were reported. In this study the current literature was reviewed to identify all those possible sources of bias that may be encountered in trying to correlate HRQOL to patient-specific or disease/treatment-specific aspects. As a result, a list of recommendations was reported to enhance the evidence of future studies. ABSTRACT: Background: health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents a secondary endpoint of medical interventions in oncological patients. Our aim was to highlight potential sources of bias that could be encountered when evaluating HRQOL in oral cancer patients. Methods: this review followed PRISMA-ScR recommendations. Participants: patients treated for oral cancer. Concept: HRQOL assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&N35/QLQ-H&N43. A critical appraisal of included studies was performed to evaluate the accuracy of data stratification with respect to HRQOL determinants. Results: overall, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria, totaling 1833 patients. In total, 8 sociodemographic (SDG) and 15 disease/treatment-specific (DT) HRQOL determinants (independent variables) were identified. The mean number of the independent variables was 6.1 (SD, 4.3)5.0 (SD, 4.0) DT-related and 1.1 (SD, 1.8) SDG-related variables per article. None of the included papers considered all the identified determinants simultaneously. Conclusions: a substantial lack of evidence regarding HRQOL determinants was demonstrated. This strongly weakens the reliability of the reported findings due to the challenging presence of baseline confounding, selection, and omitted variable biases. The proposed approach recommends the use of further evaluation tools that gather more variables in a single score together with a selection of more homogeneous, reproducible, and comparable cohorts based on the identified baseline confounding.","output":"Health-Related Quality of Life in Oral Cancer Patients: Scoping Review and Critical Appraisal of Investigated Determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid purification is a critical aspect of biomedical research and a multibillion-dollar industry.

Lecture based learning about psychiatric emergencies is a part of the induction programme for all junior doctors starting their placements however practical learning and practice of skills in this area is not. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue by providing an additional challenge to the delivery of face to face teaching for junior doctors both in clinical and educational settings.MethodThe author offered a virtual role play based teaching session to two cohorts of Junior Doctors (GP trainees and foundation trainees) who were starting their psychiatric hospital placements at Surrey and Borders Partnership. The virtual sessions were conducted over Microsoft teams. This session had been run once before as face to face teaching (F2F) in January 2019 (N = 9) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this session were compared to data obtained from the virtual sessions in November 2020 and January 2021 (N = 16).Pre and post study questionnaires were administered via Microsoft Forms. Each session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 3 different role play scenarios based around acute psychiatric emergencies. One junior doctor volunteer acted as the patient in each scenario and another volunteer as the doctor. The other participants all acted as observers. Each scenario lasted 10 minutes with ten minutes for feedback from the researcher afterwards using the ALOBA framework.Categorical, ordinal data were collected using a Likert scale and general qualitative feedback was also gathered.ResultThe questionnaire return rate was 100% for F2F teaching and 57% for virtual teaching. 100% of participants felt that F2F role play was an acceptable way to practice skills in acute psychiatry vs 75% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. 100% of participants found that F2F role play was quite or very effective in improving their confidence and perceived competence in acute psychiatry vs 88% of participants who felt this about virtual role play.ConclusionVirtual role play based learning is an acceptable and effective method in improving the confidence and perceived competence of junior doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient psychiatry but it appears to be less effective than face to face role play based learning.

An extensive analysis of human miRNA binding sites on the viral genome led to the identification of miR-1207-5p as potential regulator of the viral Spike protein. It is known that exogenous RNA can compete for miRNA targets of endogenous mRNAs leading to their overexpression. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus can act as an exogenous competing RNA, facilitating the over-expression of its endogenous targets. Transcriptomic analysis of human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells confirmed that the CSF1 gene, a known target of miR-1207-5p, is over-expressed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. CSF1 enhances macrophage recruitment and activation and its overexpression may contribute to the acute inflammatory response observed in severe COVID-19. In summary, our results indicate that dysregulation of miR-1207-5p-target genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to uncontrolled inflammation in most severe COVID-19 cases.","output":"miR-1207-5p Can Contribute to Dysregulation of Inflammatory Response in COVID-19 via Targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Preliminary research early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested children appeared to be at increased risk for child maltreatment, particularly as parents struggled with mental health and economic strains. Such strains were likely to influence parental emotions about their children, affecting their parent-child interactions to contribute to elevated maltreatment risk. To identify the potential affective elements that may contribute to such increased maltreatment risk, the current study focused on whether maternal worry about childrens behavior specifically as well as maternal anger were related to increased risk for neglect or physical or psychological aggression six months into the pandemic. METHOD: The racially diverse sample included 193 mothers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in late September-early October 2020. RESULTS: Mothers reported increases in neglect and physical and psychological aggression during the pandemic were significantly related with established measures of maltreatment risk. Furthermore, path models indicated that maternal anger and worry about childrens behavior, as well as their interaction, were significantly related to indicators of physical aggression risk and neglect during the pandemic, but only maternal anger related to increased psychological aggression during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal worry and anger about childrens behavior may have exacerbated risk for maltreatment under the stressful conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest affective reactions of both parental worry and anger focused on child behavior warrants greater empirical attention and consideration in intervention efforts both during the pandemic and potentially post-pandemic.","output":"Role of maternal emotion in child maltreatment risk during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding disease-related processes at the molecular level is of great importance for the prevention and treatment of diseases.

Given that the disruption of this interaction prevents P. vivax blood-stage infection, a PvDBP-based vaccine development has been well recognized. However, the polymorphic nature of PvDBPII prevents a strain transcending immune response and complicates attempts to design a vaccine. METHODS: Twenty-three P. vivax clinical isolates collected from three areas of Ethiopia were sequenced at the pvdbpII locus. A total of 392 global pvdbpII sequences from seven P. vivax endemic countries were also retrieved from the NCBI archive for comparative analysis of genetic diversity, departure from neutrality, linkage disequilibrium, genetic differentiation, PvDBP polymorphisms, recombination and population structure of the parasite population. To establish a haplotype relationship a network was constructed using the median joining algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 110 variable sites were found, of which 44 were parsimony informative. For Ethiopian isolates there were 12 variable sites of which 10 were parsimony informative. These parsimony informative variants resulted in 10 nonsynonymous mutations. The overall haplotype diversity for global isolates was 0.9596; however, the haplotype diversity was 0.874 for Ethiopia. Fst values for genetic revealed Ethiopian isolates were closest to Indian isolates as well as to Sri Lankan and Sudanese isolates but further away from Mexican, Papua New Guinean and South Korean isolates. There was a total of 136 haplotypes from the 415 global isolates included for this study. Haplotype prevalence ranged from 36.76% to 0.7%, from this 74.2% were represented by single parasite isolates. None of the Ethiopian isolates grouped with the Sal I reference haplotype. From the total observed nonsynonymous mutations 13 mapped to experimentally verified epitope sequences. Including 10 non-synonymous mutations from Ethiopia. However, all the polymorphic regions in Ethiopian isolates were located away from DARC, responsible for junction formation. CONCLUSION: The results of this study are concurrent with the multivalent vaccine approach to design an effective treatment. However, the presence of novel haplotypes in Ethiopian isolates that were not shared by other global sequences warrant further investigation.

This paper represents the first panel study of the Australian Epilepsy Longitudinal Survey (AELS), examining factors that influence the QoL of PWE over a six-year interval, particularly focusing on experiences of stigma, depression, and anxiety. METHODS Ninety-two adults participated in both Wave 2 (T1; 2010) and Wave 4 (T2; 2016/17) of the AELS. Average age at T2 was 53.4 years [standard deviation (SD) = 15.3; range: 22-82; 55% female]. Over the study interval, there was a shift towards more younger participants moving out of high school and older participants moving into retirement. We explored the impact of (i) experiences of stigma, (ii) mood, and (iii) sociodemographic factors on QoL at both T1 and T2 via the use of correlation analyses. Hierarchical regression was used to determine the strongest predictors of QoL at T2. RESULTS Occurrence of recent seizures, stigma, anxiety, and depression measured at T1 were all significantly correlated with total QoL at both T1 and T2. Sociodemographic factors including years of education, and weekly income before tax were not significantly correlated with QoL at either T1 or T2. QoL and depression at T1 were identified as the strongest predictors of QoL at T2 (six years later). DISCUSSION The current study supports previous research highlighting the importance of psychological factors in understating QoL in PWE, particularly stigma, anxiety, and depression. In particular, it highlights the impact of depression on QoL over a 6-year interval, providing evident for the long-term nature of this relationship.","output":"Examining quality of life in an Australian cohort of people with epilepsy over six years - Understanding the role of stigma and mood."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic had a major psychosocial impact on the mental health of children and adolescents, especially when the childhas mental health problems.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has an inherently high mutation rate. These mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability, thereby facilitating viruses to have rapid antigenic shifting to evade host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and the Wuhan wet sea food market virus sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. Our data revealed the occurrence of seven mutations in Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2. The secondary structure prediction analysis of these seven mutations shows that three of them cause alteration in the structure of RdRp. Furthermore, we did protein modelling studies to show that these mutations can potentially alter the stability of the RdRp protein. Therefore, we propose that RdRp mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates might have functional consequences that can interfere with RdRp targeting pharmacological agents.","output":"Identification of novel mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of SARS-CoV-2 and their implications on its protein structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Italy is facing the COVID\\\\19 outbreak with an abrupt reorganization of its national health\\\\system, in order to augment care provision to symptomatic patients. The sudden shift of personnel and resources towards COVID\\\\19 care has led to the reduction of surgery, with possible severe drawbacks. The aim of the study is to describe the trend in surgical volume in urology, in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty\\\\three urological units with physicians affiliated to the AGILE consortium were involved in a survey. Urologists were asked to report the amount of surgical elective procedures week\\\\by\\\\week, from the beginning of the emergency to the following month. RESULTS: The 33 hospitals involved in the study account, globally, for 22,945 beds and are distributed in 13/20 Italian regions. Before the outbreak, the involved urology units performed an overall amount of 1,213 procedures per week, half of which were oncological. One month later, the amount of surgery declined by 78%.

However, the quality of ICU-based communication has remained suboptimal, particularly concerning for Black patients and their family members. Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. OBJECTIVE: To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care. In this manuscript, we also describe steps taken to adapt the ICUconnect intervention to the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare setting.

This study examines the question: how has exploring SDoH during the Social Pediatrics rotation led to changes in residents awareness of their own practice of pediatrics? Grounded theory was used to analyse 35 reflections from residents who had submitted them as a mandatory assignment at the end of their rotation. In addition, 10 semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted to further understand residents perceptions. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysis of the reflections and interviews was guided by grounded theory using open, axial, and selective coding. Analyses of written reflections revealed the following categories: 1) judgment/bias, 2) systemic challenges, 3) advocacy, and 4) a sense that everyone is doing their best. Interview data reinforced overlapping categories of bias, systemic challenges and advocacy in addition to two new categories: 1) increased exposure and knowledge of specific disadvantaged populations, and 2) understanding impact of SDoH on overall health.

Comprehensive estimates of the global cancer burden in adolescents and young adults (aged 15C39 years) are lacking. To address this gap, we analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, with a focus on the outcome of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), to inform global cancer control measures in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Using the GBD 2019 methodology, international mortality data were collected from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, and population-based cancer registry inputs modelled with mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Incidence was computed with mortality estimates and corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated using modelled survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death. The main outcome was DALYs (the sum of YLLs and YLDs). Estimates were presented globally and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles (countries ranked and divided into five equal SDI groups), and all estimates were presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). For this analysis, we used the age range of 15C39 years to define adolescents and young adults. FINDINGS: There were 119 million (95% UI 111C128) incident cancer cases and 396 000 (370 000C425 000) deaths due to cancer among people aged 15C39 years worldwide in 2019. The highest age-standardised incidence rates occurred in high SDI (596 [545C657] per 100 000 person-years) and high-middle SDI countries (532 [488C579] per 100 000 person-years), while the highest age-standardised mortality rates were in low-middle SDI (142 [129C156] per 100 000 person-years) and middle SDI (136 [126C148] per 100 000 person-years) countries. In 2019, adolescent and young adult cancers contributed 235 million (219C252) DALYs to the global burden of disease, of which 27% (19C36) came from YLDs and 973% (964C981) from YLLs. Cancer was the fourth leading cause of death and tenth leading cause of DALYs in adolescents and young adults globally. INTERPRETATION: Adolescent and young adult cancers contributed substantially to the overall adolescent and young adult disease burden globally in 2019. These results provide new insights into the distribution and magnitude of the adolescent and young adult cancer burden around the world. With notable differences observed across SDI settings, these estimates can inform global and country-level cancer control efforts.

Immunocompromised patients are within the high-risk group to severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, there is no clear evidence of the association between impaired immune host status and complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection so far. The virus is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with infected secretions, and therefore the dental office is a highly susceptible environment for such transmission. Here, we review the literature and discuss immunological COVID-19 related issues. We also make suggestions for immunocompromised patients' support in this new emerging context of clinical dental practice. Until comprehensive findings are published, individuals with impaired immunity should be considered as high-risk. Cross infection control procedures for the clinical care of immunocompromised patients should follow the same guidelines that are being proposed for immunocompetent ones. However, during the active outbreak, people under immunosuppressive conditions should not receive elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or exposure history to COVID-19, and in case of emergence, care must be done in a separate airborne room. In the pos-pandemic phase, the dental care general recommendations should be the same for all subjects. Changes in the current guidelines have been proposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection control in order to provide the best and safe dental practice.

Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade of events occurring along disease progression within fibrovascular niches. It is initiated by endothelial dysfunction, followed by heme scavenging of CD163+ macrophages and production of CCL18. This chemokine synergizes with local CCL21 upregulation to influence the stromal composition favoring endothelial to mesenchymal transition. The local immune response is further modulated via recruitment of CCR7+ T cells into the expanding fibrovascular niche and imprinting an exhausted, T follicular helper-like phenotype in these cells. Eventually, this culminates in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Thus, our work presents misdirected immune-stromal interaction mechanisms promoting a self-sustained and non-resolving local immune response that extends beyond active viral infection and leads to profound tissue repurposing and chronic inflammation.","output":"Local CCL18 and CCL21 expand lung fibrovascular niches and recruit lymphocytes, leading to tertiary lymphoid structure formation in prolonged COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has created a calamitous situation throughout the world.

It typically manifests as a result of a familial genetic immunodeficiency disorder or secondary to a trigger such as an infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. The major factors involved in the development of the disease are an individual's genetic propensity to develop HLH, such as rare associated mutations, or inflammatory processes that trigger the immune system to go haywire. CASE REPORT Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a 22-year-old woman with a history of congenital absence of the right kidney, right-sided hearing loss, and leukopenia presented with a 3-week history of generalized malaise, fever, chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. She developed an acute systemic cytomegalovirus infection further complicated by HLH. Based on her history and clinical course, an underlying primary immunodeficiency was suspected. An immunodeficiency gene panel revealed a monoallelic mutation in GATA2, a gene that encodes zinc-transcription factors responsible for the regulation of hematopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS GATA2 deficiency encompasses a large variety of mutations in the GATA2 gene and leads to disorders associated with hematologic and immunologic manifestations of monocytopenia and B-, and natural killer-cell deficiency. Over time, affected individuals are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections and serious hematologic complications, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and/or leukemias.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relevance of individual factors (job satisfaction) and individual competences (emotional competence) for organisational commitment in a sample of healthcare professionals. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 96 healthcare professionals from March to June 2018 in the catchment area of five clinics in Bavaria, Germany. The present research examined the moderating role of emotional competence on the relationship between job satisfaction and organisational commitment using moderated regression analysis and simple slope analysis. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis indicated that emotional competence moderated the relationship between satisfaction with the job and commitment to the job. The results showed that healthcare professionals with high emotional competence are able to deal more effectively with dissatisfaction in the workplace so that organisational commitment remains unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study emotional competence of healthcare professionals is important for increasing job satisfaction and commitment to the job. Especially for healthcare professionals whose job satisfaction is low, a high level of emotional competence enables them to maintain a high level of organisational commitment. The findings of the study are discussed at the theoretical level for researchers and practical level for hospital managers interested in fostering emotional competence and improving healthcare professionals job satisfaction and their organisational commitment, which ultimately may lead to effective performance.

This study aimed to assess the challenges of screening travelers for EVD at border entry in northern Ghana. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an observational study using epidemiological weekly reports (Oct 2014-Mar 2015) of travelers entering Ghana in the Upper East Region (UER) and qualitative interviews with 12 key informants (7 port health officers and 5 district directors of health) in the UER. We recorded the number of travelers screened, their country of origin, and the number of suspected EVD cases from paper-based weekly epidemiological reports at the border entry. We collected qualitative data using an interview guide with a particular focus on the core and support functions (e.g. detection, reporting, feedback, etc.) of the World Health Organizations Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system. Quantitative data was analyzed based on travelers screened and disaggregated by the three most affected countries. We used inductive approach to analyze the qualitative data and produced themes on knowledge and challenges of EVD screening. RESULTS: A total of 41,633 travelers were screened, and only 1 was detained as a suspected case of EVD. This potential case was eventually ruled out via blood test. All but 52 of the screened travelers were from Ghana and its contiguous neighbors, Burkina Faso and Togo. The remaining 52 were from the four countries most affected by EVD (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali). Challenges to effective border screening included: inadequate personal protective equipment and supplies, insufficient space or isolation rooms and delays at the border crossings, and too few trained staff. Respondents also cited lack of capacity to confirm cases locally, lack of cooperation by some travelers, language barriers, and multiple entry points along porous borders. Nonetheless, no potential Ebola case identified through border screening was confirmed in Ghana. CONCLUSION: Screening for Ebola remains sub-optimal at the entry points in northern Ghana due to several systemic and structural factors.

METHODS: We used operations research (linear programming) to model the problem. We used the framework of the Canadian Society of Palliative Care Physicians and the Nova Scotia palliative care strategy to apply the model. RESULTS: To meet the palliative care needs for persons dying across Nova Scotia in 2019, the model generated an estimate of 70.8 nurses, 23.6 physicians and 11.9 social workers, a total of 106.3 staff. Thereby, the model indicated that a 64% increase in specialist palliative care staff was needed immediately, and a further 13.1% increase would be needed over the next 20 years. Trained primary palliative care providers currently meet 3.7% of need, and with their expansion are expected to meet 20.3% by 2038.

The model is tested using data from several countries, showing that a single function is able to describe very different shapes of the outbreak. The diverse behavior of the outbreak on those countries is presented and discussed. Moreover, a criterion to determine the existence of the pandemic peak and a expression to find the time to reach herd immunity are also obtained.","output":"A fractal viewpoint to COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feed intolerance and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) are challenges while treating sick neonates. These can be reduced by giving human milk, but adequate availability of mothers own milk or pasteurised donor human milk (PDHM) is a challenge in neonatal setups, like ours, without an attached human milk bank. Hence, this quality improvement initiative was taken to improve donor human milk collection in our urban tertiary-care teaching hospital, to at least 500 mL per week in 4 weeks. After analysing the problem, our quality improvement team identified a shortage of human milk donation that was due to low awareness among the stakeholders and lack of a system to collect and store human milk and transport it to a milk bank. The team first established a system of supplies needed for milk collection, storage and transportation. It then tested change idea of information, education and counselling to increase milk donation. The team carried out a few plan-do-study-act cycles (individual and group counsellings, and usage of videos and information leaflets) to test the change ideas and adapted a few and abandoned some. During this journey, the milk collection increased to above the target amount. Various challenges were addressed, and there was a need for constant motivation of the stakeholders, especially the mothers, and now there is sustained milk donation in the setup. This is incorporated in the standard operating procedure and as a quality indicator of the unit for sustaining the changes in the unit. Our initiative can be replicated in other setups for increasing collection of donor human milk. Greater PDHM availability for sick neonates will, in effect, reduce NEC and feeding intolerance rates, leading to reduced hospital stay, morbidity, mortality and economic burden.","output":"Improving donor human milk collection in a hospital without a human milk bank: a quality improvement initiative at an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, the use of hysteroscopy should be limited to specific, urgent pathologies in order to avoid a deleterious impact on healthcare services.","output":"The role of hysteroscopy during COVID\\\\19 outbreak: Safeguarding lives and saving resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy is commonly performed for patients post respiratory failure in long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs). However the outcome of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the LTACH is not known. Research question What is the ventilator liberation rate of tracheostomized patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure (COVID) compared to respiratory failure unrelated to COVID-19 (non-COVID) in the LTACH? Study Design and Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we examined mechanically ventilated patients discharged between June 2020 and March 2021. Of 242 discharges, 165 patients arrived with tracheostomy and were considered for ventilator liberation. N=128 patients were non-COVID and N=37 patients were admitted for COVID. Results The primary outcome of the study was ventilator liberation; secondary outcomes were: functional recovery, length of stay (LOS) at LTACH and discharge disposition. After controlling for demographics, the number of comorbidities, hemodialysis, vasopressor need, thrombocytopenia and the LOS at the STACH, our results indicate that COVID patients had a higher adjusted ventilator liberation rate of 91.4% versus 56.0% in their non-COVID peers. Functional ability was assessed with the change of Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU) score between admission and discharge. The adjusted mean change in FSS-ICU score was significantly higher in the COVID group than in the non-COVID group 9.49 (95% CI=7.38-11.6) versus 2.08 (95% CI =1.05-3.11) in the non-COVID group (p<0.001). COVID patients had a shorter adjusted LOS at the LTACH with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.57 (95% CI=1.0-2.46, p=0.05) compared to non-COVID. We did not observe significant differences between the two groups in their discharge location, but there was a trend towards need for lower level of care in COVID patients. Interpretation Our study suggests that COVID patients requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy have a higher chance for recovery than their non-COVID counterparts.","output":"Mechanical ventilator liberation of COVID-19 patients in long-term acute care facility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter underscores the need for more explicit and strategic engagement of stakeholders (scientists, clinicians, first responders, amongst others) by the intelligence community.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., Massachusetts has been leading other states in the total number of COVID-19 cases. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing site access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: (1) Residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COVID-19 infections among minority groups. (2) Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Non-Hispanic Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of the accessibility of testing sites by all populations. (3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection. (4) Different from the findings of previous studies, the elderly population rate is not statistically significantly correlated with the incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hotspot regions of COVID-19 infections. The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts.","output":"Racial Segregation, Testing Site Access, and COVID-19 Incidence Rate in Massachusetts, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the outbreak of COVID-19 began, people could not go out. It was not allowed to provide agricultural machinery services in different places across regions to reduce the flow and gathering of people. Improvement of utilization efficiency of agricultural machinery resources is required through scientific scheduling of agricultural machinery. With seizing the farming season and stabilizing production as the goal, this paper studied the scientific scheduling of tractors within the scope of town and established agricultural machinery operation scheduling model with the minimization of total scheduling cost as the optimization objective. Factors such as farmland area, agricultural machinery, and farmland location information and operating time window are considered in this model to improve the accuracy of the agricultural machinery operation scheduling model. The characteristics of multiple scheduling algorithms are analyzed comprehensively. The scheduling requirements of agricultural machinery operation to ensure spring ploughing are combined to design the agricultural machinery scheduling algorithm based on the SA algorithm. With Hushu Street, Jiangning District, Nanjing City, as an example, a comparative experiment is conducted on the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) designed in this paper and the empirical algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). The results suggest that the total cost of the scheduling scheme generated by the SA algorithm is 19,042.07 yuan lower than that by the empirical scheduling algorithm and 779.19 yuan lower than that by the genetic algorithm on average. Compared with the GA algorithm, the transfer distance, waiting cost, and delay cost of the SA algorithm are reduced by 11.6%, 100%, and 98.1% on average, indicating that the transfer distance of agricultural machinery in the scheduling scheme generated by the SA algorithm is shorter, so is the waiting and delay time. Meanwhile, it can effectively obtain the near-optimal solution that meets the time window constraint, with good convergence, stability, and adaptability.

The present investigation focuses on the controversies that have characterized PHAS' work with reference to risk assessments, facemasks, voluntarism, testing, and the protection of the elderly during the pandemic. Overall, this inquiry demonstrates that PHAS' risk assessments were initially overly optimistic and their facemask recommendations in conflict with large segments of the scientific community for an extensive period.

METHODS: In this single-center and retrospective study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 12 remained hospitalized at the end of the study and 167 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 153 (91.6%) were discharged and 14 (8.38%) died in hospital. Approximately half (50.9%) of patients suffered from a comorbidity, with diabetes or coronary heart disease being the most common in 20 patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, dyspnea, and cough. The mean durations from first symptoms to hospital admission was 8.64  4.14 days, whereas the mean hospitalization time to discharge or death was 5.19  2.42 and 4.35  2.70 days, respectively.

We evaluated the impact of this pre-existing cellular response on incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: This was a follow-up study of 38 seronegative healthcare workers (HCWs) with previous evaluation of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Infection was considered in the presence of a positive RT-PCR test and/or confirmed seroconversion. RESULTS: Twenty of the 38 HCWs included (53%) had a previous specific CD8+ T-cell response to peptides encompassing the spike protein (S) in 13 (34%), the membrane (M) in 17 (45%), or/and the nucleocapsid (N) in three (8%). During a follow-up of 189 days (interquartile range (IQR) 172-195), 11 HCWs (29%) had an RT-PCR-positive test (n = 9) or seroconverted (n = 2). Median duration of symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-7), and time to negative RT-PCR was 9 days (IQR 4-10). Notably, six incident infections (55%) occurred in HCWs with a pre-existing T-cell response (30% of those with a cellular response), who showed a significantly lower duration of symptoms (three were asymptomatic). Three of the six HCWs having a previous T-cell response continued to test seronegative. All the infected patients developed a robust T-cell response to different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially to protein S (91%).

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R(0), across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R(0) value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R(0), the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","output":"Estimating the reproductive number R(0) of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and eight European countries and implications for vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Almost nothing is known about how the infant may experience being in a womens Refuge (Shelter) setting with their mother after fleeing family violence, despite the high numbers of infants and young children in Refuges or Shelters.

Lipid rafts, enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins, are special plasma membrane microdomains involved in several processes in viral infections. The extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to lipid rafts. Because cholesterol-rich microdomains appear to be a general feature of the entry mechanism of non-eneveloped viruses and of several coronaviruses, the purpose of this study was to analyse the contribution of lipids to the infectivity of canine coronavirus (CCoV). The CCoV life cycle is closely connected to plasma membrane cholesterol, from cell entry to viral particle production. The methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) was employed to remove cholesterol and to disrupt the lipid rafts. Cholesterol depletion from the cell membrane resulted in a dose-dependent reduction, but not abolishment, of virus infectivity, and at a concentration of 15 mM, the reduction in the infection rate was about 68 %. MCD treatment was used to verify if cholesterol in the envelope was required for CCoV infection. This resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect, and at a concentration of 9 mM MCD, infectivity was reduced by about 73 %. Since viral entry would constitute a target for antiviral strategies, inhibitory molecules interacting with viral and/or cell membranes, or interfering with lipid metabolism, may have strong antiviral potential. It will be interesting in the future to analyse the membrane microdomains in the CCoV envelope.","output":"Role of the lipid rafts in the life cycle of canine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Equity is one of three dimensions of universal health coverage (UHC). However, Iraq has had capital-focused health services and successive conflicts and political turmoil have hampered health services around the country. Iraq has embarked on a new reconstruction process since 2018 and it could be time to aim for equitable healthcare access to realise UHC. We aimed to examine inequality and determinants associated with Iraq's progress towards UHC targets. METHODS: We assessed the progress toward UHC in the context of equity using six nationally representative population-based household surveys in Iraq in 2000-2018. We included 14 health service indicators and two financial risk protection indicators in our UHC progress assessment. Bayesian hierarchical regression model was used to estimate the trend, projection, and determinant analyses. Slope and relative index of inequality were used to assess wealth-based inequality. RESULTS: In the national-level health service indicators, inequality indices decreased substantially from 2000 to 2030. However, the wide inequalities are projected to remain in DTP3, measles, full immunisations, and antenatal care in 2030. The pro-rich inequality gap in catastrophic health expenditure increased significantly in all governorates except Sulaimaniya from 2007 to 2012. The higher increases in pro-rich inequality were found in Missan, Karbala, Erbil, and Diala. Mothers' higher education and more antenatal care visits were possible factors for increased coverage of health service indicators. The higher number of children and elderly population in the households were potential risk factors for an increased risk of catastrophic and impoverishing health payment in Iraq. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce inequality in Iraq, urgent health-system reform is needed, with consideration for vulnerable households having female-heads, less educated mothers, and more children and/or elderly people. Considering varying inequity between and within governorates in Iraq, reconstruction of primary healthcare across the country and cross-sectoral targeted interventions for women should be prioritised.","output":"Equity and determinants in universal health coverage indicators in Iraq, 2000-2030: a national and subnational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Database activity monitoring systems aim to protect organizational data by logging users activity to Identify and document malicious activity.

In addition, astroviruses were identified in 14 (37.8%) of the fecal samples from the affected crew members, and multiple viral infections of both NV and ASV were observed in 6 cases. The genogrouping of the NV-positive samples was then examined by dot blot hybridization, and it was determined that all of the isolates were from genogroup II (GII). No bacterial pathogens were subsequently isolated from fecal specimens. Furthermore, a variety of NV strains were identified by sequencing and single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analyses of PCR products from the fecal samples. One recombinant NV isolate, Minato/14, was identified as a recombinant NV strain of GII/6 and GII/1.

In vaginally delivered neonates, a surge of AVP is released into the bloodstream at levels exceeding release during life-threatening conditions such as hemorrhagic shock. It is currently unknown where the potential sites of action are in the neonate for these robust levels of circulating AVP at birth. The purpose of this study is to identify the location of AVP receptor 1a (AVPR1A) sites as potential peripheral targets of AVP in the neonatal mouse. RT-qPCR analysis of a sampling of tissues from the head demonstrated the presence of Avpr1a mRNA, suggesting local peripheral translation. Using competitive autoradiography in wildtype (WT) and AVPR1A knockout (KO) postnatal day 0 (P0) male and female mice on a C57BL/6J background, specific AVPR1A ligand binding was observed in the neonatal mouse periphery in sensory tissues of the head (eyes, ears, various oronasal regions), bone, spinal cord, adrenal cortex, and the uro-anogenital region in the neonatal AVPR1A WT mouse, as it was significantly reduced or absent in the control samples (AVPR1A KO and competition).

COVID-19 patients may develop various disease symptoms that hinder the accurate clinical diagnosis. SUMMARY Routine diagnosis of COVID-19 requires complementary investigations, including computed tomography, immunological assays, and molecular assays like real-time RT-PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS), and CRISPR-based assays. Clinically approved antiviral drugs available for the COVID-19 treatment are very limited. The most common measurements that enhance health condition and patients' viability are conservation fluid management, oxygen therapy, and antibiotics. Several therapeutic options have been developed or repurposed to prevent virus replication and/or modulate the immune response against virus infection. These options include various drugs that affect virus entry and membrane fusion, inhibit polymerase and protease activity, suppress the host pro-inflammatory cytokines, and utilize cell therapy approaches. Key Messages: In this review, we aimed to provide an up-to-date discussion on the current diagnostic options and therapeutic strategies used to control and manage COVID-19 in clinical and point-of-care settings.","output":"Latest insights on the diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ANCA-associated RPGN leads to renal failure through systemic vasculitis and diffuse crescentic glomerulonephritis.

Detection of these RNA H-type pseudoknots can improve our understanding of RNA structures and their associated functions. However, the currently existing programs for detecting such RNA H-type pseudoknots are still time consuming and sometimes even ineffective. Therefore, efficient and effective tools for detecting the RNA H-type pseudoknots are needed. Results: In this paper, we have adopted a heuristic approach to develop a novel tool, called HPknotter, for efficiently and accurately detecting H-type pseudoknots in an RNA sequence. In addition, we have demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of HPknotter by testing on some sequences with known H-type pseudoknots. Our approach can be easily extended and applied to other classes of more general pseudoknots.

An association with cerebrovascular diseases, especially cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), has been reported among these patients. The objective of the present study was to identify risk factors for CVT as well as its presentation and outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter and multinational observational study. Ten centers in 4 countries (Pakistan, Egypt, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates) participated in this study. The study included patients (aged >18 years) with symptomatic CVT and recent COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (70% men) were included. Their mean age was 42.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common presenting symptoms, with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. CVT was the presenting feature in 13 cases (65%), while 7 patients (35%) developed CVT while being treated for COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common imaging finding was infarction (65%), followed by hemorrhage (20%). The superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site of thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised, including elevated serum D-dimer (87.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69%), and C-reactive protein (47%) levels. Homocysteine was elevated in half of the tested cases. The mortality rate was 20% (4 patients). A good functional outcome was seen in the surviving patients, with a mean modified Rankin Scale score at discharge of 1.3. Nine patients (45%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0C1 at discharge. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related CVT is more common among males at older ages when compared to previously reported non-COVID-19-related CVT cases. CVT should be suspected in COVID-19 patients presenting with headache or seizures. Mortality is high, but functional neurological outcome is good among survivors.","output":"Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Associated with COVID-19 Infection: An Observational, Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study intended to observe mental symptoms among physicians in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the factors leading to such symptoms.

Enasidenib (ENA) is a selective oral inhibitor of the mutant IDH2 enzyme with single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We report the results of the open label phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ENA, as monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine (AZA) in pts with higher-risk IDH2-mutated MDS (NCT03383575). Methods: Pts with higher-risk [Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk &gt; 3 or high molecular risk (HMR)] MDS/CMML or LB AML na?ve to hypomethylating agents (HMA) received ENA100 mg orally daily for 28 d of each 28-d cycle + AZA 75 mg/m2 IV or SC on d 1-7 of each cycle (ENA+AZA), and pts with refractory or progressive MDS to prior HMA therapy received ENA alone (ENA), in 28-d cycles until unacceptable toxicity, relapse, transformation to AML, or progression. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) [complete remission (CR), marrow CR (mCR), partial remission (PR) and hematologic improvement (HI)]. Other endpoints include safety, and survival outcomes. Results: 48 pts received ENA+AZA (n = 26) or ENA (n = 22). The median age was 73 yrs (range, 46-83). Most pts (72%) had HMR: ASXL1 (39%), and RUNX1 (17%). Median number Tx cycles was 4 (2-32) in the ENA+AZA, and 7 (1-23) in the ENA arm. Common Tx-related grade 3-4 AEs in the ENA+AZA arm were neutropenia (64%), thrombocytopenia (28%), and anemia (8%);these occurred in 10%, 0%, and 5%, in the ENA arm. Grade 3-4 infections occurred in 32% (ENA+AZA) and 14% (ENA). IDH differentiation syndrome occurred in 3 pts (12%) in the ENA+AZA and 5 pts (24%) in the ENA arm. Two deaths occurred during the initial 60 d, both unrelated to study and due to COVID. In response-evaluable pts (n=46), ORR was 84% (n = 21/25;24% CR + 8% PR+44% mCR+ 8% HI] in the treatment na?ve ENA+AZA and 43% (n = 9/21;24% CR+5%PR+5% mCR+10% HI) in the HMA failure ENA arm (Table). Most common reason for Tx discontinuation was disease progression (ENA+AZA 20%, ENA 33%).5 pts (20%) received HCT in the ENA+AZA and 1 (5%) in the ENA arm. 7 pts in the ENA+AZA and 5 in the ENA arm were ongoing at data cutoff (Dec 31, 2020). After a median follow up of 12.6 mo, median OS was 32.2 mo in the ENA+AZA and 21.3 mo in the ENA arm. Conclusions: ENA is well tolerated and shows promising efficacy in IDH2-mutated higher risk MDS.

Identifying approaches to counteract craving in people of different sexes may facilitate the development of personalized treatments for Tobacco Use Disorder, which disproportionately affects women. Because cigarette craving is associated with nicotine dependence and structure of the insula, this study addressed whether a persons sex influences these associations. METHODS: The research participants (n = 99, 48 women) reported daily cigarette smoking and provided self-reports of nicotine dependence. After overnight abstinence from smoking, they underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scanning to determine cortical thickness of the left and right anterior circular insular sulcus, and self-rated their cigarette craving before and after their first cigarette of the day. RESULTS: Women reported stronger craving than men irrespective of smoking condition (i.e., pre- and post-smoking) (P = .048), and smoking reduced craving irrespective of sex (P < .001). A 3-way interaction of sex, smoking condition, and right anterior circular insular sulcus thickness on craving (P = .033) reflected a negative association of cortical thickness with pre-smoking craving in women only (P = .012). No effects of cortical thickness in the left anterior circular insular sulcus were detected. Nicotine dependence was positively associated with craving (P < .001) across groups and sessions, with no sex differences in this association.

We described clinical characteristics and compared factors contributing toward arrhythmic versus nonarrhythmic death. Of 1258 patients screened, 133 died and were enrolled. Of these, 55.6% (74/133) were male, 69.9% (93/133) were racial/ethnic minorities, and 88.0% (117/133) had cardiovascular disease. The last cardiac rhythm recorded was VT or fibrillation in 5.3% (7/133), pulseless electrical activity in 7.5% (10/133), unspecified bradycardia in 0.8% (1/133), and asystole in 26.3% (35/133).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific articles and studies on intracranial microhemorrhages in the setting of COVID-19 were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Included studies described intracranial microbleed(s) on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with COVID-19. If multiple patients were described, only patients with intracranial microhemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging were included for analysis. Patient demographics, severity of illness (e.g. intensive care unit admission and/or intubation), time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to magnetic resonance imaging, and location(s) of any observed microhemorrhages were noted. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with suspected intracranial microhemorrhages have been described in prior studies. The average age of patients was 64.7 years; 21.9% were women. The average time between COVID-19 diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging was 31.7 days.

From the questionnaire responses only questions that covered the participants occupation; sociodemographic details, isolation and impact of coronavirus were selected. Further analyses were performed on output measures that included leisure time, physical activity, sedentary time and emotions. All output measures were evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with an intensity ranging from 0C100. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman correlational analysis were applied to the leisure time, physical activity, sedentary time and emotional feeling datasets; p = 0.05 was set as the significance level. Both males and females displayed similar output measures. The Wilcoxon signed rank test showed significant differences with respect to Prior COVID-19 and Currently for sedentary activity (Z = ?40.462, p < 0.001), physical activity (Z = ?30.751, p < 0.001) and all other emotional feeling output measures. A moderate correlation between Prior COVID-19 and Currently was observed among the Males (r = 0.720) in comparison to the Females (r = 0.639) for sedentary activity while weaker correlations (r < 0.253) were observed for physical activity and emotional feeling measurements, respectively. Our study reported incremental differences in the physical and psychological output measures reported, i.e., Prior COVID-19 and Currently. Prior COVID-19 and Currently participants increased their sedentary habits by 2.98%, and the level of physical activity reduced by 2.42%, depression levels increased by 21.62%, anxiety levels increased by 16.71%, and stress levels increased by 21.8%. There were no correlations (r) between leisure, physical activity and sedentary action (i.e., Prior = ?0.071; Currently = ?0.097); no correlations (r) between leisure physical activity and emotion (i.e., ?0.071 > r > 0.081) for Prior; and poor correlations (r) between leisure, physical activity and sedentary action (i.e., ?0.078 > r > 0.167) for Current. The correlations (r) between sedentary action and emotion for Prior and Currently were (?0.100 > r > 0.075) and (?0.040 > r > 0.041) respectively. The findings presented here indicate that the COVISTRESS project has created awareness in relation to the physical and psychological impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings have also highlighted individual distress caused by COVID-19 and associated health consequences for the global community.","output":"An Assessment of the Novel COVISTRESS Questionnaire: COVID-19 Impact on Physical Activity, Sedentary Action and Psychological Emotion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) in utero is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. MIA-induced deficits in adolescent and adult offspring have been well characterized; however, less is known about the effects of MIA exposure on embryo development. To address this gap, we performed high-resolution ex vivo MRI to investigate the effects of early (gestational day [GD]9) and late (GD17) MIA exposure on embryo (GD18) brain structure. We identify striking neuroanatomical changes in the embryo brain, particularly in the late-exposed offspring. We further examined the putative neuroanatomical underpinnings of MIA timing in the hippocampus using electron microscopy and identified differential effects due to MIA timing. An increase in apoptotic cell density was observed in the GD9-exposed offspring, while an increase in the density of neurons and glia with ultrastructural features reflective of increased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress was observed in GD17-exposed offspring, particularly in females. Overall, our findings integrate imaging techniques across different scales to identify differential impact of MIA timing on the earliest stages of neurodevelopment.","output":"Differential effects of early or late exposure to prenatal maternal immune activation on mouse embryonic neurodevelopment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: COVID-19 pandemic has impacted different business sectors around the world.

More than a year later, the protest movements, which called themselves revolutionary (\\"thawra\\"), are hardly visible. Even the trauma of the August 4th explosion in the port of Beirut, resulting from the same negligence on the part of public authorities, did not provoke the remobilization of collective dynamics.

The performance of terminal care was positively correlated with attitudes toward nursing care of the dying (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) and nurses characteristics (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). There was also a positive correlation (r = 0.58, p < 0.001) between attitudes toward nursing care for dying patients and nurses characteristics. Nurses characteristics had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and performance of terminal care. This means that the nurses character had a buffering effect on the relationship between attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and performance of terminal care in hospice care units. These findings suggest that continuous and repetitive educational programs on terminal care need to be enhanced, and strategies to strengthen attitudes toward nursing care of the dying and nurses character need to be included in these programs.","output":"Moderating Effect of Nurses Character on the Relationship between Attitudes toward Nursing Care of the Dying and Performance of Terminal Care in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter does not attempt to provide a comprehensive catalogue of the various methods of analysis and technologies used to characterize pathogens (molecular epidemiology).

Aim: The aim of this work is to highlight how individual reflective practices and group reflections contribute to the development of group skills. More specifically, the effectiveness of relevant group dynamics is investigated, with the aim of creating a space for reflection, and activation for individual and group empowerment. Participants: The participants were 130 university students (86% female), resided in northwestern Italy, and had a mean age of 27.5 years (SD = 7.52). They were randomly divided into 23 groups (ranged from four to nine members). Method: The participants engaged in several online training activities and at the end of every activity they completed individual reflection practice in which they presented both positive and negative aspects related to the group experiences. Then they participated in online group reflections that allowed them to reflect on the group dynamics, particular attention given to factors such as climate, participation and roles played by each participant in a variety of training activities. This study analyzes 130 individual reflective practices and 23 group reflections. The data collected through individual reflective practices and the transcripts of the group reflections were analyzed using grounded theory. Two independent judges analyzed and categorized the data and then identified the main common categories that emerged by the support of Nvivo software. Results: From the analysis of the content, it is determined that the participants, based on the construction of the individual and group reflections, paid greater attention to the dynamics that occurred within the group during the various activities in which they participated, thus allowing them to be more aware of the various factors that affected the importance attributed to the different roles, the climate, and their active participation.

Results: The results of correlation showed that the relationship between AHS scores with PHQ-9 (P<0.01) and Brief IPQ (P<0.01) was negative and significant. The relationship between Brief IPQ and PHQ-9 scores was also positive and significant (P<0.01). The proposed mediating model had a relatively good fit.

NPIs require public interest to be successful. In the United States, there is a lack of published research on the factors that influence public interest in COVID-19. Using Google Trends, we examined the US level of public interest in COVID-19 and how it correlated to testing and with other countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how public interest in COVID-19 in the United States changed over time and the key factors that drove this change, such as testing. US public interest in COVID-19 was compared to that in countries that have been more successful in their containment and mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, Google Trends was used to analyze the volume of internet searches within the United States relating to COVID-19, focusing on dates between December 31, 2019, and March 24, 2020. The volume of internet searches related to COVID-19 was compared to that in other countries. RESULTS: Throughout January and February 2020, there was limited search interest in COVID-19 within the United States. Interest declined for the first 21 days of February. A similar decline was seen in geographical regions that were later found to be experiencing undetected community transmission in February. Between March 9 and March 12, 2020, there was a rapid rise in search interest. This rise in search interest was positively correlated with the rise of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI ?2.9 to 9.7; P<.001). Within the United States, it took 52 days for search interest to rise substantially after the first positive case; in countries with more successful outbreak control, search interest rose in less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Containment and mitigation strategies require public interest to be successful. The initial level of COVID-19 public interest in the United States was limited and even decreased during a time when containment and mitigation strategies were being established. A lack of public interest in COVID-19 existed in the United States when containment and mitigation policies were in place. Based on our analysis, it is clear that US policy makers need to develop novel methods of communicating COVID-19 public health initiatives.","output":"Fluctuation of Public Interest in COVID-19 in the United States: Retrospective Analysis of Google Trends Search Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID\\\\19 was first reported from China, and on 19 February 2020, the first case was confirmed in Qom, Iran.

The serial interval was estimated with a gamma distribution, a mean of 4.55 days and a standard deviation of 3.30 days for the COVID\\\\19 epidemic based on Qom data. The R(0) in this study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom. Of the four countries studied, the lowest R(0) was estimated in South Korea (1.5C2) and the highest in Iran (4C5). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R(0) is sensitive to the applied mean generation time. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to estimate R(0) in Qom.

Thus, encouraging them to participate in green initiatives is difficult. Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hesitate to comply with green initiatives as they require a substantial amount of investment. This study empirically examines the causal relationship between the partnership governance mechanism and the success of GSCM. Based on transaction-cost economics theory (i.e., opportunism) and relational perspectives (i.e., trust) as the theoretical background, this study found that governance mechanisms between suppliers and manufacturers are positively related to GSCM performance. It showed that formal governance is important in the process-management side, while relational governance is critical for sharing knowledge in GSCM.

For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. METHODS: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. RESULTS: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. CONCLUSIONS: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","output":"Agile Requirements Engineering and Software Planning for a Digital Health Platform to Engage the Effects of Isolation Caused by Social Distancing: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evolutionary medicine is a concept that arose mainly in the 1990s, and which applies evolutionary biological principles to human medical fields. For instance, evolutionary medicine proposed that there is an evolutionary mismatch between the human anatomy and physiology and novel, man\\\\made environments, leading to the so\\\\called diseases of civilization. Constraints exist on the process of natural selection, and evolutionary trade\\\\offs can prevent traits from being optimal, leaving humans with traits that at first sight seem maladaptive, such as the very narrow birth canal of humans. More generally, certain traits can increase reproduction at the cost of health and longevity. Other traits, such as pain and fever, are related to protective physiological defences, and not diseases. Some medical topics have biological roots in the field of ethology, particularly human ethology, such as the behavioural aspects of psychiatry and addiction. Compulsive overeating and binge eating show similarities to substance\\\\linked addictions and behavioural addictions. Interactions between behaviour, stress and diseases have ancient evolutionary roots, which may lead to a mismatch to the modern human environment. A subject of high, topical interest is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic, as the behavioural aspects of population compliance are crucial for the success in fighting the pandemic. Ethology, and evolutionary biology in general, can substantially contribute to improving the biological understanding of medical phenomena, and therefore of medical and public health interventions.

However, it may manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms that may overlap with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). COVID-19 appears to have higher mortality in those with comorbidities. We aimed to assess the outcomes of coinfection in these patients. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients with CDI and COVID-19 from January 1st, 2020 to November 17th, 2020. Both infections were diagnosed via PCR. Clinical features, treatment for COVID-19 and CDI and outcomes including intensive care unit admission, colectomy, 30 day-mortality and long-term complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 21 patients (20 hospitalized) with median age 70.9 years (range 51.8C90.7 years) had CDI and COVID-19 within 4 weeks of each other. Of these, 4 patients (19%) with CDI were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of admission, 12 (57%) had CDI diagnosed after COVID-19, and 5 (23.9%) developed COVID-19 within 4 weeks after CDI. Fourteen patients (66.7%) were treated with medications directed against COVID-19 including remdesivir and dexamethasone (n=7), remdesivir with convalescent plasma (n= 1), remdesivir (n= 5) and dexamethasone (n=1). The most common treatment for CDI was oral vancomycin in 20 patients (95.2%), and 1 patient received intravenous metronidazole. No patient required colectomy for CDI but 2 (9.5%) required ICU admission. Four patients (19%) died likely due to COVID-19 with median age 80 years (range 61C90 years). CONCLUSION: The relationship between COVID-19 and CDI is poorly understood, and studies are required to further investigate this association. Whether coinfection results in a worsening of outcomes, including mortality and clinical course, are questions that should be answered in future research studies.

The prevalence of anxiety among the public has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors on anxiety experienced among social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors among WeChat users in mainland China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From February 10 to February 24, 2020, a nationwide, web-based cross-sectional survey study was carried out using convenience sampling. Participants' levels of anxiety, positive psychological responses, and information-seeking behaviors were assessed. The survey was distributed among WeChat users via the WeChat smartphone platform. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item [GAD-7] scale score &#8805;7) among WeChat users in China was 17.96% (446/2483) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that information-seeking behaviors such as cannot stop searching for information on COVID-19, being concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spending more than 1 hour per day consuming information about the pandemic were found to be associated with increased levels of anxiety. Additionally, participants who chose social media and commercial media as the primary sources to obtain information about the COVID-19 pandemic were found more likely to report anxiety. Conversely, participants who were confident or rational about the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to report anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that positive psychological responses and information-seeking behaviors were closely associated with anxiety among WeChat users during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It might be paramount to enhance mental well-being by helping people respond to the COVID-19 pandemic more rationally and positively in order to decrease symptoms of anxiety.","output":"Factors Influencing Anxiety Among WeChat Users During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mainland China: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of improving mobile platforms and faster 4G speed, the annual growth of mobile devices has exceeded 50%, and many catering enterprises have integrated services to make ordering and delivery more convenient for smartphone users.

Findings: Of 477,234 participants, 10,279 (2.2%) reported AEs, of which 139 (1.4%) were serious. Women reported more AEs than men (2.3% vs. 1.6%). AE reports decreased with increasing age (3.2% for 18 to 30, 2.1% for 31 to 45, 1.8% for 46 to 55 and 1.5% in >55 year olds). Participants with previous COVID 19 infection reported slightly more AEs (2.6% vs. 2.1%). The commonest reactogenicity events were headache and body aches, followed by injection site pain and fever, and most occurred within 48 hours of vaccination. Two cases of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome and four cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome were reported post-vaccination. Serious AEs and AEs of special interest including vascular and nervous system events, immune system disorders and deaths occurred at lower than the expected population rates.

Short-term outcomes of the robotic group (RG) were compared to the \\"Initial Phase\\" group (IP) of 120 LLS cases and the 120 most recent laparoscopic cases or \\"Mastery Phase\\" group (MP). A cost analysis per procedure for the three groups was performed. Seventy-one patients underwent RLS during the study period. Median operative time in the RG was comparable to the IP, but significantly shorter in the MP (140 vs 138 vs 120 min, p < 0.001). Median intraoperative blood loss in the RG was lower than in both laparoscopic groups (40 ml [20-90 ml] vs 150 ml [50-250 ml] vs 80 ml [30-150 ml], p < 0.001). Median hospital stay in the RG was significantly shorter than the IP group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in postoperative complication, conversion, or readmission rates.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of \\"Socio-demographics\\", \\"Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)\\", \\"Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)\\", \\"Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)\\" and \\"Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)\\" are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 44.213.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.094.17 vs 6.494.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.245.16 vs 6.373.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others.

How these inequalities are perceived and to what degree perceptions are aligned with actual distributions, is important for trust in public health services, social and economic policies, and policymakers. This study aims to assess perceived and desired levels of inequality in health and wealth in Germany and the UK. METHODS: The online-survey was filled out by 769 volunteers (322 from Germany, 447 from the UK), recruited from an existing commercial panel (Prolific Academic) or via Facebook advertisements in 2019. Perceived and ideal national health and wealth distributions were assessed and compared to actual health indicators (i.e. days absent from work, number of visits to general practitioners (GPs) and self-rated health), and actual wealth distributions with t-tests. RESULTS: A pronounced gap emerged between the estimated, ideal and actual inequality. Both samples strikingly underestimated the proportion of (very) good health in the national distribution by a factor of ~ 2.3 (participants estimated that 34% of the German and 36% of the UK population respectively are very healthy or healthy, while the actual proportion in the population was 75% in Germany and 84% in the UK, P < 0.001 for all). Moreover, actual health distributions were much closer to the desired than the perceived health distributions (78% of German and 72% of UK participants ideally being very healthy or healthy). A reversed pattern of results emerged for wealth in both samples, with wealth inequality being strikingly worse than desired and inequality being underestimated by a factor ~ 1.7 (P < 0.001 for all). Results were consistent across demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents in both Germany and the UK have profoundly negative misperceptions regarding the distribution of health, which contrasts with starkly positive misperceptions regarding the distribution of wealth, indicating that the public is healthier but poorer than they think.

We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: We analysed data from the prospective Dutch CovidPredict cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. SETTING: Patients from eight participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the CovidPredict cohort were included. PARTICIPANTS: Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during the hospitalisation. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid-lowering therapy and antidiabetics. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors. RESULTS: We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 6615 of whom 60.5% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid-lowering therapy and antidiabetics were used by 45%, 34.7% and 22.1% of patients. After 21-days of follow-up; 19.2% of the patients had died or were discharged for palliative care. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for age and sex showed that the presence of 2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.02), but not with ICU admission. Moreover, the use of 2 antidiabetics and 2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of, respectively, 2.09 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.80) and 1.46 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.91).

However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction.

With increasing rates of mortality caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, urban vertical cemeteries are experiencing interments at an unprecedented rate. Corpses interred in the 3rd to 5th layer of vertical urban cemeteries have the potential to contaminate large adjacent regions. The general objective of this manuscript is to analyze the reflectance of altimetry, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) in the urban cemeteries and neighbouring areas of the City of Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is assumed that the population residing in the vicinity of these cemeteries may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 contamination through the displacement of microparticles carried by the wind as a corpse is placed in the burial niche or during the first several days of subsequent fluid and gas release through the process of decomposition. The reflectance analyses were performed utilizing Landsat 8 satellite images applied to altimetry, NDVI and LST, for hypothetical examination of possible displacement, transport and subsequent deposition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results showed that two cemeteries within the city, cemeteries A and B could potentially transport SARS-CoV-2 of nanometric structure to neighboring residential areas through wind action. These two cemeteries are located at high relative altitudes in more densely populated regions of the city. The NDVI, which has been shown to control the proliferation of contaminants, proved to be insufficient in these areas, contributing to high LST values. Based on the results of this study, the formation and implementation of public policies that monitor urban cemeteries is suggested in areas that utilize vertical urban cemeteries in order to reduce the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Use of geospatial tools to predict the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in urban cemeteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. METHOD: We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. RESULTS: Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. DISCUSSION: The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality.","output":"'Intelligent' lockdown, intelligent effects?

METHODS: We saved residual outpatient laboratory samples of all previously mRNA-vaccinated individuals in the adult medicine clinics of a public hospital with a large outpatient HIV clinic during May 2021, and then excluded individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next 1:1 matched 100 PLWH to 100 outpatient HIV-negative adult medicine patients receiving care for chronic medical conditions on days since completion of second vaccination (minimum 10), sex, age +/-5 years, and the type of mRNA vaccine received. We defined a non-response as reciprocal pseudovirus neutralizing titer< 10 and anti-RBD IgG< 10 relative fluorescent units, and compared non-response by HIV status using mixed models. RESULTS: In each matched group there were 13 women; 25 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine and 75 received the BNT162b2 vaccine; the median age was 59. The median time from second vaccination was 35 days (IQR: 20C63). Among PLWH, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 511 (IQR: 351C796) and 5 individuals had HIV RNA > 200. We found 2.4-fold greater odds of pseudovirus neutralizing antibody non-response among PLWH compared to people without HIV (95% CI=1.1C5.4). Although few individuals in each group did not mount an IgG response (12 among PLWH vs. 5; p=0.08), continuous anti-RBD IgG concentrations were 43% lower among PLWH (95% CI=0.36C0.88). Among PLWH, when adjusting for age, sex, and days post-vaccination, each 100-cell increase in CD4+T-cell count was associated with 22% higher neutralizing antibody titers (GMR 1.22; 95% CI=1.09C1.37). Unsuppressed HIV RNA >200 was associated with 89% lower neutralizing antibody titers (GMR 0.11; 95% CI=0.01C0.84).

Methods: We use linked administrative data to describe SARS-CoV-2 testing, positive tests, and COVID-19 primary care service use in British Columbia from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021, stratified by immigration status (Citizen, Permanent Resident, Temporary Resident). We plot the rate of people tested and the rate of people confirmed positive for COVID-19 by week from April 19, 2020, to July 31, 2021, across immigration groups. Results: 4.9% of people with temporary immigration status had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 over this period, compared to 4.0% among people with permanent residency and 2.1% among people who hold Canadian citizenship. This pattern is persistent by sex/gender, age group, neighborhood income quintile, health authority, and in both metropolitan and small urban settings. At the same time we observe lower access to testing and COVID-19 related primary care among people with temporary status. Interpretation: People with temporary immigration status in BC experience higher SARS-CoV-2 test positivity; alarmingly, this was coupled with lower access to testing and primary care. Interwoven immigration, health and occupational policies place people with temporary status in circumstances of precarity and higher health risk. Extending permanent residency status to all immigrants residing in Canada and decoupling access to health care from immigration status could reduce precarity due to temporary immigration status.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 related primary care use among people with citizenship, permanent residency, and temporary immigration status in British Columbia: Cross-sectional analysis of population-based administrative data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples. It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract. The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.","output":"Laboratory protocol for the digital multiplexed gene expression analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples using the NanoString nCounter system (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious global health threat caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In fact, this massive release of inflammatory cytokines into in the pulmonary alveolar structure is a main cause of mortality during COVID-19 infection. Current management of COVID-19 is supportive and there is no common clinical protocol applied to suppress this pathological state. Lactoferrin (LF), an iron binding protein, is a first line defense protein that is present in neutrophils and excretory fluids of all mammals, and is well recognized for its role in maturation and regulation of immune system function. Also, due to its ability to sequester free iron, LF is known to protect against insult-induced oxidative stress and subsequent cytokine storm that results in dramatic necrosis within the affected tissue.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of ED among subjects with a reported diagnosis of COVID\\\\19 and to measure the association of COVID\\\\19 and ED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from the Sex@COVID online survey (performed between April 7 and May 4, 2020, in Italy) to retrieve a sample of Italian male sexually active subjects with reported SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. A matching sample of COVID\\\\19\\\\negative male sexually active subjects was also retrieved using propensity score matching in a 3:1 ratio. The survey used different standardized psychometric tools to measure effects of lockdown and social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health of Italian subjects. RESULTS: One hundred subjects were included in the analysis (25 COVID\\\\positive; 75 COVID\\\\negative). The prevalence of ED, measured with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men, was significantly higher in the COVID+ group (28% vs. 9.33%; p = 0.027).

However, few studies have been conducted on whether the incidence of gastrointestinal infections has changed over the past year with COVID-19. In this study, we examined how the incidence of gastrointestinal infections has changed since COVID-19 outbreak through open data. METHODS: We summarized the data on the several viruses and bacteria that cause gastrointestinal infections from the open data of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency for 3 years from March 2018 to February 2021 (from Spring 2018 to Winter 2020). Moreover, we confirmed three most common legal gastrointestinal infectious pathogens from March 2016. RESULTS: From March 2020, when the COVID-19 epidemic was in full swing and social distancing and personal hygiene management were heavily emphasized, the incidence of infection from each virus was drastically decreased. The reduction rates compared to the averages of the last 2 years were as follows: total viruses 31.9%, norovirus 40.2%, group A rotavirus 31.8%, enteric adenovirus 13.4%, astrovirus 7.0%, and sapovirus 12.2%. Among bacterial pathogens, the infection rates of Campylobacter and Clostridium perfringens did not decrease but rather increased in some periods when compared to the average of the last two years. The incidence of nontyphoidal Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, or enteropathogenic Escherichia coli somewhat decreased but not significantly compared to the previous two years.

Emerging evidence has indicated that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in cerebrovascular diseases. The function of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases remains an interesting field of research. In this review, we first summarised the pathological mechanism of cerebrovascular diseases and the pathological mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome in aggravating atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Second, we outlined signalling pathways through which the NLRP3 inflammasome participates in aggravating or mitigating cerebrovascular diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B), ROS/thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and purinergic receptor-7 (P2X7R) signalling pathways can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome; activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can aggravate cerebrovascular diseases by mediating apoptosis and pyroptosis. Autophagy/mitochondrial autophagy, nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), interferon (IFN)-, sirtuin (SIRT), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) reportedly alleviate cerebrovascular diseases by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

We tested whether genetic variation in the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) is a differential susceptibility factor for daily events. Participants (N = 326, 77% female, mean age = 25, range = 17C36) completed smartphone questionnaires four times a day over four to five days, measuring stressors, uplifts, positive and negative affect.

The 5-HTTLPR fulfilled all criteria of a differential susceptibility factor: Positive affect in carriers of the short allele (S) was less reactive to both uplifts and stressors, compared to homozygous carriers of the long allele (L/L).

METHODS: Using a robotic system containing six identical wound simulators, the authors tested the sorptivity performances of the Exufiber Ag + (M?lnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden) primary dressing (ExAg-polyvinyl alcohol [PVA]) against a market-leading comparator product, when used with a secondary foam dressing. The durability of the primary dressings after simulated use was further investigated through tensile mechanical testing. RESULTS: The ExAg-PVA primary dressing delivered greater fluid amounts for absorbency and retention by the secondary foam dressing, approximately 2- and 1.5-fold more than the comparator dressing pair after 10 and 15 hours, respectively. The ExAg-PVA dressing was also substantially less sensitive to the direction of pulling forces and, accordingly, exhibited post-use mechanical strength that was approximately four and six times greater than that of the other primary dressing (when the latter dressing was tested out-of-alignment with its visible seams) after 10 and 15 hours, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics of the sorptivity and fluid sharing between primary and secondary dressings and the effect of directional preference of strength of the primary dressings for adequate durability, resulting in safe post-use removals, have been described.

Coronaviruses induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), but the role of DMVs in replication and virus fitness remains unclear. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), three of which, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are necessary and sufficient for DMV formation. It has been shown previously that mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 loop 1 that alter nsp4 glycosylation are associated with disrupted DMV formation and result in changes in virus replication and RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether DMV morphology or another function of nsp4 glycosylation is responsible for effects on virus replication. In this study, we tested whether mutations across nsp4, both alone and in combination with mutations that abolish nsp4 glycosylation, affected DMV formation, replication, and fitness. Residues in nsp4 distinct from glycosylation sites, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal loop 1, independently disrupted both the number and morphology of DMVs and exacerbated DMV changes associated with loss of glycosylation. Mutations that altered DMV morphology but not glycosylation did not affect virus fitness while viruses lacking nsp4 glycosylation exhibited a loss in fitness. The results support the hypothesis that DMV morphology and numbers are not key determinants of virus fitness. The results also suggest that nsp4 glycosylation serves roles in replication in addition to the organization and stability of MHV-induced double-membrane vesicles. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense RNA viruses modify host cytoplasmic membranes for viral replication complex formation. Thus, defining the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane modifications is essential for both understanding virus replication and development of novel approaches to virus inhibition. Coronavirus-induced membrane changes include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes. Three viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are known to be required for DMV formation. It is unknown how these proteins induce membrane modification or which regions of the proteins are involved in DMV formation and stability. In this study, we show that mutations across nsp4 delay virus replication and disrupt DMV formation and that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial fitness cost. These results support a critical role for nsp4 in DMV formation and virus fitness.","output":"Mutations across murine hepatitis virus nsp4 alter virus fitness and membrane modifications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data about variations in stroke incidence and subsequent major adverse outcomes are essential to inform secondary prevention and prioritizing resources to those at the greatest risk of major adverse end points. We aimed to describe the age, sex, and socioeconomic differences in the rates of first nonfatal stroke and subsequent major adverse outcomes.

The incidence rate (IR) ratio of first nonfatal stroke and subsequent major adverse outcomes (composite major adverse cardiovascular events, recurrent stroke, cardiovascular disease-related, and all-cause mortality) were calculated and presented by year, sex, age group, and socioeconomic status based on an individuals location of residence, in adults with incident nonfatal stroke diagnosis between 1998 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 82 774 first nonfatal stroke events were recorded in either primary care or hospital dataan IR of 109.20 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 108.46C109.95). Incidence was significantly higher in women compared with men (IR ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.12C1.15]; P<0.001). Rates adjusted for age and sex were higher in the lowest compared with the highest socioeconomic status group (IR ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08C1.13]; P<0.001).

Massive transfusion protocols (MTP) are one resource-intensive practice that utilize significant amounts of blood products. Alterations to the composition of MTP parameters to conserve scarce biologic resources have hitherto not been examined during the pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous 18-question survey was administered to 115 hospitals with valid email contact information. Survey questions addressed whether institutions have altered their MTPs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and blood shortages, and if so, what adjustments they have made. Additional details concerning potential differences in the number and cycles of MTPs and blood product wastage during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the year prior were assessed. RESULTS: 50 responses were received (43 % response rate). 10 % (5/50) of institutions altered their MTPs utilizing a variety of approaches in attempt to conserve blood during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four additional institutions intend to alter them if it becomes necessary. Following onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 % of institutions (12/50) reported an increase in monthly MTP activations, while 16 % (8/50) reported decreased activations compared to prior to the pandemic. 22 % (11/50) of institutions experienced increased blood wastage, whereas 16 % (8/50) reported decreased waste compared to pre-pandemic. DISCUSSION: The results of this survey highlight a variety of mechanisms by which institutions have attempted to conserve blood via altering MTPs.

In the past 10 years, numerous studies have shown that infected individuals have a significantly higher incidence of mental and physical health problems and are more prone to exhibiting the adverse effects of various diseases. METHODS: A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4499 (786 Toxoplasma-infected) participants and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of COVID-19. RESULTS: Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlling for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 1.50) before sport (OR = 1.30) and borreliosis (1.27). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0.146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat-keeping on higher likelihood of COVID infection and higher severity of the course of infection because the effect of cat-keeping was also observed (and in particular) in a subset of Toxoplasma-infected respondents (Tau = 0.153).

CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for COVID-19, and Toxoplasma-infected individuals are neither informed about their higher risk nor prioritised in vaccination programs. Because toxoplasmosis affects a large segment of the human population, its impact on COVID-19-associated effects on public health could be considerable.

Electric power used in a computer converts into heat and thus, the system takes fewer watts ensuring less cooling. This lower energy consumption allows to be less costly to run as well as reduces the environmental impact of powering the computer. One of the most challenging problems for the modern green supercomputers is the reduction of current power consumptions. Consequently, regular conventional interconnection networks also show poor cost performance. On the other hand, hierarchical interconnection networks (like-3D-TTN) can be a possible solution to those issues. The main focus for this paper is the estimation of power usage at the on-chip level for 3D-TTN with the various other networks along with the analysis of static network performance. In our analysis, 3D-TTN requires about 32.48% less router power usage at the on-chip level and can also achieve near about 21% better diameter performance as well as 12% better average distance performance than the 5D-Torus network. Similarly, it also requires only about 14.43% higher router power usage; however, can achieve 23.21% better diameter performance and 26.3% better average distance than recent hierarchical interconnection network- 3D-TESH. The most attractive feature of this paper is the static hop distance parameter and per watt analysis (power-performance). According to our power-performance results, 3D-TTN can also show better result than the 3D-Mesh, 2D-Mesh, 2D-Torus and 3D-TESH network even at the lowest network level. Moreover, this paper is also featured with the static effectiveness analysis, which ensures cost and time efficiency of 3D-TTN.","output":"3D-TTN: a power efficient cost effective high performance hierarchical interconnection network for next generation green supercomputer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Providers need to be comfortable addressing obesity and gestational weight gain so they may give appropriate care; however, health care providers lack guidelines for the most effective educational strategies to assist in providing optimal care. OBJECTIVE To identify studies that involved the obstetric provider in interventions for either the perinatal management of obesity and/or gestational weight gain in a systematic review. SEARCH STRATEGY A keyword search of databases was performed up to April 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA Obstetric providers who participated in an intervention with the aim to change a provider's clinical practice, knowledge, and/or satisfaction with the intervention in relation to the perinatal management of obesity or gestational weight gain were included. Provider intervention could include training or education, changes in systems or organization of care, or resources to support practice. PROSPERO database #42016038921. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Bias was assessed according to the validated Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The following variables were synthesized: study location and setting, provider and patient characteristics, intervention features, outcomes and efficacy, and strengths and weakness. MAIN RESULTS Of the 6,821 abstracts screened, seven studies (4 quantitative, 3 mixed-methods) with a total of 335 providers met the inclusion criteria; two of which focused on the management of obesity, three focused on gestational weight gain, and two focused on both topics. Interventions that incorporated motivational interviewing skills (n = 2), required additional training for the research study and addressed specific knowledge deficits such as nutrition and exercise (n = 3), and interfaced with the electronic medical record (n = 1) demonstrated the greatest impact on provider outcomes. Provider reported satisfaction scores were generally favorable, but none addressed provider-level efficacy in practice change. CONCLUSIONS Given the limited number of studies, varying range of provider participation, and lack of provider-level efficacy, further evaluation of provider training and involvement in interventions for perinatal obesity or gestational weight gain is indicated to determine best practices for provider and patient outcomes.","output":"Targeting obstetric providers in interventions for obesity and gestational weight gain: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower blood oxygen levels, even in patients without hypoxia requiring hospitalization.

In Spain, the first wave was especially severe. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify sources and levels of distress among Spanish primary care physicians (PCPs) during the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey that included sociodemographic data, a description of working conditions related to distress [such as gaps in training in protective measures, cleaning, and hygiene procedures in work setting, unavailability of personal protective equipments (PPEs) and COVID-19 RT-PCR test, and lack of staff due to be infected] and a validated scale, the Self-applied Acute Stress Scale (EASE). The survey was answered by a non-probability sampling of PCPs working in family healthcare centres from different regions of Spain. Analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: In all, out of 518 PCP participants, 123 (23.7%) obtained high psychological distress scores. Only half of them had received information about the appropriate use of PPE. PCP characteristics associated with higher levels of distress include female gender [1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54, 2.84]; lack of training in protective measures (1.96; 95% CI 0.94, 2.99); unavailable COVID-19 RT-PCR for health care workers after quarantine or COVID-19 treatment (?0.77 (?1.52, ?0.02). Reinforcing disinfection of the work environment (P < 0.05), availability of PPEs (P < 0.05), and no healthcare professional was infected (P < 0.05) were related to the lowest distress score.

SUMMARY: In this review, we highlight key findings from preclinical research and recent clinical studies demonstrating that H2 reduces the organ damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion. We outline the critical role this effect plays in a variety of medical emergencies, including myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic shock, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as in organ transplantation. H2 is compared with established treatments such as targeted temperature management, and we discuss its possible mechanisms of action, including the recently identified suppression of TNF-&#945;-mediated endothelial glycocalyx degradation by inhaled H2 .

Machine learning modalities integrating findings from these common laboratory test results might accelerate ruling out COVID-19 in emergency department patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop (ie, train and internally validate with cross-validation techniques) and externally validate a machine learning model to rule out COVID 19 using only routine blood tests among adults in emergency departments. METHODS: Using clinical data from emergency departments (EDs) from 66 US hospitals before the pandemic (before the end of December 2019) or during the pandemic (March-July 2020), we included patients aged &#8805;20 years in the study time frame. We excluded those with missing laboratory results. Model training used 2183 PCR-confirmed cases from 43 hospitals during the pandemic; negative controls were 10,000 prepandemic patients from the same hospitals. External validation used 23 hospitals with 1020 PCR-confirmed cases and 171,734 prepandemic negative controls. The main outcome was COVID 19 status predicted using same-day routine laboratory results. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve as well as sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Of 192,779 patients included in the training, external validation, and sensitivity data sets (median age decile 50 [IQR 30-60] years, 40.5% male [78,249/192,779]), AUROC for training and external validation was 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92). Using a risk score cutoff of 1.0 (out of 100) in the external validation data set, the model achieved sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 41.7%; with a cutoff of 2.0, sensitivity was 92.6% and specificity was 59.9%.

RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there is a large debate on the use of antimalarials for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease based on preclinical in-vitro data, small case series and extrapolation from earlier studies of their effect on intracellular pathogens, including many viruses. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine have not demonstrated robust efficacy in prior randomized controlled studies against several other viruses.

Using data on population movements of 366 Chinese cities at the daily level from the Baidu Maps-Migration Big Data Platform and historical data on the average monthly income of migrant workers, we find that the average work resumption rate (WRR) during the period of the Chinese Lantern Festival was 25.25%, which was only 30.67% of that in the same matched lunar calendar period in 2019. We then apply Gray Model First Order One Variable [GM (1, 1)] to predict the monthly income of migrant workers during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that, if without the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average monthly income of migrant workers in 2020 will be expected to increase by 12% compared with 2019. We further conduct scenario analysis and show that the average monthly income of migrant workers in 2020 under the conservative scenario (COS), medium scenario (MES), and worse scenario (WOS) will be predicted to decrease by 2, 21, and 44%, respectively.

Continuous measurements of (222)Rn and CO(2) concentrations, together with basic meteorological parameters, were carried out in an apartment (floor area about 27 m(2)) located in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Throughout the experiment (October 3C15), frequent ventilation (several times per day), poor ventilation (once to twice per day) and no ventilation scenarios were applied, and the exact ventilation and occupancy schedule were recorded. Based on the measurements, a transient simulation of (222)Rn and CO(2) concentrations was performed for six sets of scenarios, where the design ventilation rate (DVR) varied based on the ventilation requirements and recommendations. On the days of frequent ventilation, a moderate correlation between the measured and simulated concentrations (r = 0.62 for (222)Rn, r = 0.55 for CO(2)) was found. The results of the simulation indicated the following optimal DVRs: (i) 36.6 m(3) h(?1) (0.5 air changes per hour, ACH) to ensure a CO(2) concentration below 1000 ppm and a (222)Rn concentration below 100 Bq m(?3); and (ii) 46.9 m(3) h(?1) (0.7 ACH) to ensure a CO(2) concentration below 800 ppm. These levels are the most compatible with the 5C_Cat I (category I of indoor environmental quality, defined by EN 16798-1:2019) scenario, which resulted in concentrations of 656  121 ppm for CO(2) and 57  13 Bq m(?3) for (222)Rn. The approach presented is applicable to various types of residential buildings with high overcrowding rates, where a sufficient amount of air volume to achieve category I indoor environmental quality has to be provided.

Therefore, early selection and use of optimal antibiotics are essential. The direct rapid antibiotic susceptibility test (dRAST) can detect antibiotic resistance within 6 h of a Gram smear result. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of dRAST for improving early selection of appropriate antibiotics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with bacteremia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 blood culture-positive COVID-19 patients. Bacterial isolates and antimicrobial resistance profiles of each case were evaluated. Cases were divided into two groups based on whether they underwent conventional antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) or dRAST. The time to optimal targeted treatment for the two groups was investigated and compared. In addition, we examined the proportion of cases for which appropriate antibiotics were selected and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered at 72 h from blood sample collection. RESULTS: The mean time to optimal targeted antibiotic treatment was shorter for the dRAST group [55.7; standard deviation (SD), 28.7 vs. 92.3; SD, 51.1 h; P = 0.041]. The proportion of cases receiving optimal targeted antibiotics 72 h after blood collection for culture was higher [6/10 (60.0%) vs. 10/25 (40.0%)] and the percentage receiving broad spectrum antibiotics at 72 h was lower [6/10 (60.0%) vs. 19/25 (76.0%)] in the dRAST group than in the conventional AST group. In terms of microbiology profile, the contamination rate was high (35.5%) and multidrug-resistant strains were common (63.2%) in COVID-19 patients with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Application of dRAST for selection of antibiotics to treat bacteremia in COVID-19 patients may enable earlier and optimal treatment. The high incidence of contamination and resistant organisms in blood cultures from COVID-19 patients suggest that dRAST may speed up appropriate targeted treatment.","output":"A Direct Rapid Phenotypic Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Enables Early Selection of Optimal Antibiotics to Treat Bacteremia in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of Herd immunity is a key factor for epidemic control.

It has been suggested that coronavirus will likely become similar to a seasonal flu once the herd immunity is attained. Till then, it will continue causing outbreaks year-round and there could be multiple waves of virus transmission before achieving herd immunity.

Older adults, especially those with high needs, experience social isolation and have high rates of emergency visits and limited satisfaction with the care they receive. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies present opportunities to address these challenges. To date, limited information is available on Canadian older adults' attitudes toward and use of mHealth technologies for self-tracking purposes-an area that is increasingly important and relevant during the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: This study presents contributions to an underresearched area on older adults and mHealth technology use. The aim of this study was to compare older adults' use of mHealth technologies to that of the general adult population in Canada and to investigate the factors that affect their use. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey on mHealth and digital self-tracking was conducted. A web-based questionnaire was administered to a national sample of 4109 Canadian residents who spoke either English or French. The survey instrument consisted of 3 sections assessing the following items: (1) demographic characteristics, health status, and comorbidities; (2) familiarity with and use of mHealth technologies (ie, mobile apps, consumer smart devices/wearables such as vital signs monitors, bathroom scales, fitness trackers, intelligent clothing); and (3) factors influencing the continued use of mHealth technologies. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population in the use of smart technologies and internet (P<.001). Approximately 47.4% (323/682) of the older adults in the community reported using smartphones and 49.8% (340/682) indicated using digital tablets. Only 19.6% (91/463) of the older adults using smartphones/digital tablets reported downloading mobile apps, and 12.3% (47/383) of the older adults who heard of smart devices/wearables indicated using them. The majority of the mobile apps downloaded by older adults was health-related; interestingly, their use was sustained over a longer period of time (P=.007) by the older adults compared to that by the general population. Approximately 62.7% (428/682) of the older adults reported tracking their health measures, but the majority did so manually. Older adults with one or more chronic conditions were mostly nontrackers (odds ratio 0.439 and 0.431 for traditional trackers and digital trackers, respectively). No significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population with regard to satisfaction with mHealth technologies and their intention to continue using them. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging mHealth technologies in partnership with health care providers and sharing of health/well-being data with health care professionals and family members remain very limited. A culture shift in the provision of care to older adults is deemed necessary to keep up with the development of mHealth technologies and the changing demographics and expectations of patients and their caregivers.","output":"Comparison of Mobile Health Technology Use for Self-Tracking Between Older Adults and the General Adult Population in Canada: Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction : There is a dearth of data on anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic from people living with HIV (PLHIV). This is a cause of concern as anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. Globally, India has the third largest population of PLHIV and third highest number of COVID-19 cases which are rapidly increasing. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during this pandemic. Methods: We used data from a telephonically delivered assessment among PLHIV engaged in care at a tertiary healthcare associated antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Assessments were conducted between April 21 and May 28, 2020, one month into the government mandated lockdown. GAD-7 was used to assess for anxiety over two-preceding weeks. Significant sociodemographic and clinical differences between groups (GAD-7<10 and GAD-710) were assessed using Fishers exact and Wilcoxson rank sum tests, for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze an open-ended question that asked about the most pressing cause(s) of concern. Results : Of 167 PLHIV contacted, median age was 44 years (IQR:40 C 50), 60% (n=100) were cisgender women and 81% (n=135) had a monthly family income<200 USD. Thirty-eight percent (n=64) had prior history of tuberculosis and 27% (n=45) were living with another comorbidity. A fourth (25%, n=41) had GAD-7 scores indicative of generalized anxiety. PLHIV who had fewer remaining doses of ART had significantly higher GAD-7 scores compared to those that had more doses (p=0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. Conclusions : In a group of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV, a fourth were found to have anxiety, that appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. Furthermore, the persistence of sources of anxiety and therefore an increase in anxiety for these PLHIV is anticipated as the pandemic worsens in India. We recommend the regular utilization of short screening tools for anxiety to monitor and triage PLHIV as an extension of current HIV-services.","output":"The Burden of Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among People Living with HIV (PLHIV) in Pune, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Health insurance offers many benefits to clients and veterinarians, such as the ability to perform necessary and possibly cost-intensive medical interventions without financial constraints, or to potentially prevent euthanasia based on financial challenges. However, concerns about negative consequences, such as the overuse of diagnostic tests or overtreatment, have also been raised. METHODS Using an online questionnaire distributed via e-mail, which included a section on health insurance, we investigated the relative number of insured dogs and cats treated by Austrian, Danish and UK veterinarians (N = 636) and the attitudes of those veterinarians toward health insurance. Further, using a case vignette, we examined whether coverage by health insurance may influence treatment suggestions. RESULTS Even though veterinarians in all three countries believe that health insurance reduces stress since clients' financial resources will be less important, we found that Austrian veterinarians are more likely to agree that health insurance is unnecessary compared to Danish and UK veterinarians. Further, many raised the concern that insurance policies influence clinical decisions; and less than half supported the idea of making insurance mandatory. A majority of veterinarians in Austria and the UK thought that insurance can lead to the overuse of diagnostic tests, and in the UK a majority also thought that it can lead to overtreatment. Using case vignettes, we found that veterinarians were significantly more likely to suggest a CT scan to a client with an insured animal, in contrast to a client with stated financial limitations. Further, UK veterinarians were more likely to suggest a CT scan to a client with an insured animal, in contrast to a client without insurance. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we found that veterinarians, in general, were in favour of health insurance, and that greater coverage may increase more cost-intensive veterinary care.

DESIGN: Systematic review. ELIGIBILITY: Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact. DATA ANALYSIS: Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores). RESULTS: 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (IQR -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42% (-53% to -32%), admissions 28% (-40% to -17%), diagnostics 31% (-53% to -24%) and for therapeutics 30% (-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no difference.

AIM: The current computational work focuses on multi-level rigorous screening of 47 medicinal plant-based phytochemicals for discovering effective phytochemical inhibitors against the host and viral targets. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A total of 586 phytochemicals were analyzed in detail based on their drug-likeness, pharmacological properties, and structure-based activity against the viral proteins (Spike glycoprotein, Papain-like protease, and Main protease) and host proteins (ACE2, Importin-subunit -5, and -1). Phytochemicals showing higher binding affinity with the dual capacity to target both the categories of proteins were further analyzed by profiling their chemical reactivity using Density-functional theory (DFT) based quantum chemical methods. Finally, detailed molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the interactions of the complexes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the selected phytochemicals from Andrographis paniculata, Aconitum heterophyllum, Costus speciosus and Inula racemosa may have the capacity to act with prominent affinity towards the host and viral proteins.

The approach was applied in rural Tajikistan to evaluate changes effected by a development project that promoted the enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystem services in agrarian landscapes. The central building block of the assessment consisted of participatory workshops in 2018 and 2020 with farmers and other stakeholders to develop a systemic knowledge map and to evaluate the promoted strategies based on local expertise. The methodological basis was MARISCO (adaptive MAnagement of vulnerability and RISk at COnservation sites), a holistic and participatory approach to ecosystem-based assessment and management that requires well-trained facilitators. While the activities in 2018 could be implemented as planned, major changes in the work plan were necessary in 2020 due to severe travel restrictions and social distancing rules. Conducting virtual workshops was not possible, as it would have excluded key stakeholders from the process. Instead of conducting a comprehensive assessment workshop guided by two German MARISCO facilitators as originally planned, a series of short and small workshops could be realized. These workshops were facilitated by Tajik scientists after receiving virtual training from their German colleagues. Although it was possible to bring the assessment to a satisfactory conclusion, the methodological changes revealed significant drawbacks. Radical simplifications of the methods were necessary that led to reduced depth of the assessment and missed learning opportunities for participants. Limited experience in workshop guidance by the new facilitators posed challenges to the participatory process and the quality of its outcomes. While the adapted method created training effects that would otherwise have been missed, it also put additional pressure on the capacities of local partners. Our experience during the pandemic offers valuable lessons learned for future applications of systemic-participatory approaches. Whereas, a complete shift to remote applications is problematic, there is a need to put greater emphasis on capacitating local partners. Methodological trade-offs are necessary for partially remote working processes, but principles of participation and systemic thinking should not be compromised.

Overall, in patients with hypothyroidism (n=65), n=21(32.3%) patients expired of whom 14 (66.7%) patients were females and 7 (33.3%) were males. In these patients, no statistically significant difference was observed between the expired and discharged groups (Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR adj ): 1.04 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.59-1.83 p-value=0.87). As a result, hypothyroidism was not linked to an increased risk of death. Conclusion: In this current study, we demonstrated that the prevalence of hypothyroidism was higher in hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in the normal population especially in females but without significant adverse effects on the risk of mortality from this disease.","output":"Prevalence of Hypothyroidism Among Patients With COVID-19, Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Government of India imposed various phases of lockdown starting from the third week of March 2020. Improvement in city air quality has emerged as a benefit of this lockdown in India. The objective of this paper is to quantify the health benefits due to this lockdown. PM2.5 concentrations in nonattainment cities (NACs) in Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) in North India were studied. Data from prelockdown and the various lockdown phases were compared, with 2019 as a benchmark. Compared with those in 2019, the PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown Phase 1 were approximately 44.6% lower for cities in Uttar Pradesh and approximately 58.5% lower for the Delhi-NCR. The health impacts of particle inhalation were quantified using the multiple-path particle dosimetry and AirQ+ models, which revealed that the most considerable improvement was during lockdown Phase 1. Among the prelockdown and lockdown phases, Phase 1 exhibited the minimum PM2.5 concentration and thus the greatest health benefits. For the selected cities, the concentration of particle deposition in the tracheobronchial region of human lungs showed its maximum reduction during lockdown Phase 1(30.14%). Furthermore, the results highlighted a decrease of 29.85 deaths per 100,000 persons during lockdown Phase 1, primarily due to the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations. This quantification of the health benefits due to a decrease in PM2.5 may help policymakers implement suitable control measures, especially for NACs, where the respirable particulate matter concentrations remain very high. ? 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Schools were suspended and teaching was shifted to home-based distance learning models, with higher education institutions carrying this out for the longest period of time. The pandemic has also had an impact on mental health, and tertiary students seem to be particularly vulnerable. METHODS: A cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in February and March 2021. The final sample consisted of 5999 respondents. The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Slovenian tertiary students was assessed using the Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7). Participants with and without more pronounced depressive and anxiety symptoms were dichotomized using a cut-off value of 10 points, with higher scores indicating higher presence of symptoms and categorized into 5 severity levels according to total scale scores. Suicidal ideation was examined using 9th item of the PHQ-9. RESULTS: Data show that 55% of respondents reported having more pronounced depressive symptoms (PHQ-910), with 16% reporting severe depressive symptoms. 5.1% of respondents reported having suicidal ideation more than half of the days and 5% reported having them almost every day. 51.3% of respondents reported having more pronounced anxiety symptoms (GAD -710), with 30.7% reporting severe anxiety symptoms. Females reported more depressive and anxiety symptoms than males. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study are to some extent consistent with the findings of comparable studies, but show higher proportions of depressive and anxiety symptoms with the highest severity levels. The data suggest that there is a case for tailored public health interventions that respond to the identified mental health needs of tertiary students in Slovenia. KEY MESSAGES: 55% of respondents reported having depressive symptoms (PHQ-910), with 16% reporting severe depressive symptoms, and 10.1% reported frequent suicidal ideation. 51.3% of the respondents reported having more pronounced anxiety symptoms (GAD -710), with 30.7% reporting severe anxiety symptoms.","output":"Depression and anxiety symptoms among Slovenian tertiary students during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is an important risk factor for atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis, for which there are no treatments approved by regulatory authorities. Objectives: To assess adverse events and tolerability of a short interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to reduce hepatic production of apolipoprotein(a) and to assess associated changes in plasma concentrations of Lp(a) at different doses. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single ascending dose study of SLN360, an siRNA targeting apolipoprotein(a) synthesis conducted at 5 clinical research unit sites located in the US, United Kingdom, and Australia. The study enrolled adults with Lp(a) plasma concentrations of 150 nmol/L or greater at screening and no known clinically overt cardiovascular disease. Participants were enrolled between November 18, 2020, and July 21, 2021, with last follow-up on December 29, 2021. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive placebo (n = 8) or single doses of SLN360 at 30 mg (n = 6), 100 mg (n = 6), 300 mg (n = 6), or 600 mg (n = 6), administered subcutaneously. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was evaluation of safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included change in plasma concentrations of Lp(a) to a maximum follow-up of 150 days. Results: Among 32 participants who were randomized and received the study intervention (mean age, 50 [SD, 13.5] years; 17 women [53%]), 32 (100%) completed the trial. One participant experienced 2 serious adverse event episodes: admission to the hospital for headache following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and later for complications of cholecystitis, both of which were judged to be unrelated to study drug. Median baseline Lp(a) concentrations were as follows: placebo, 238 (IQR, 203-308) nmol/L; 30-mg SLN360, 171 (IQR, 142-219) nmol/L; 100-mg SLN360, 217 (IQR, 202-274) nmol/L; 300-mg SLN360, 285 (IQR, 195-338) nmol/L; and 600-mg SLN360, 231 (IQR, 179-276) nmol/L. Maximal median changes in Lp(a) were -20 (IQR, -61 to 3) nmol/L, -89 (IQR, -119 to -61) nmol/L, -185 (IQR, -226 to -163) nmol/L, -268 (IQR, -292 to -189) nmol/L, and -227 (IQR, -270 to -174) nmol/L, with maximal median percentage changes of -10% (IQR, -16% to 1%), -46% (IQR, -64% to -40%), -86% (IQR, -92% to -82%), -96% (IQR, -98% to -89%), and -98% (IQR, -98% to -97%), for the placebo group and the 30-mg, 100-mg, 300-mg, and 600-mg SLN360 groups, respectively.

Methods: All patients who underwent telemedicine visits at one urban academic medical center between March 2020 and June 2020 were included. All departments were included including surgical and nonsurgical. Demographic data, primary language, and visit type were collected. Primary zip code was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status through use of the zip code median household income. The demographics of the New York metropolitan area were obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau and used as a control cohort. Results: A total of 362,413 telemedicine visits met inclusion criteria with the majority of visits performed in April and May; 127,851 (35.3%) and 110,166 (30.4%), respectively. The highest performing department was Internal Medicine, which performed 72,796 visits or 20% of the total cohort. In our cohort of telemedicine patients, 59.6% identified as White, 11.4% as Black, and 5.7% as Asian. This is less diverse than the overall population of the metropolitan area, which is 17.5% Black and 11.5% Asian. There was also a large gender gap in the utilization of telemedicine services in general, where women (60.2%) were more likely than men (39.8%) to utilize the virtual visits. In addition, although over a third of patients in the Metropolitan area have median household incomes of <50,000, this population only represented 13.6% of our total cohort. Conclusions: This study highlights both the capability of telemedicine to provide care at a large urban academic medical center during a pandemic in addition to identifying potential gaps in care with telemedicine.

We investigated avelumab (anti-programmed death ligand-1 [PD-L1]) maintenance after first-line induction chemotherapy for GC/GEJC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: JAVELIN Gastric 100 was a global, open-label, phase III trial. Eligible patients had untreated, unresectable, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic GC or GEJC. Patients without progressive disease after 12 weeks of first-line chemotherapy with oxaliplatin plus a fluoropyrimidine were randomly assigned 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or continued chemotherapy, stratified by region (Asia v non-Asia). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) after induction chemotherapy in all randomly assigned patients or the PD-L1-positive randomly assigned population (&#8805; 1% of tumor cells; 73-10 assay). RESULTS: A total of 805 patients received induction; 499 were randomly assigned to avelumab (n = 249) or continued chemotherapy (n = 250). Median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 12.0 months) versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 12.4 months) and 24-month OS rate was 22.1% versus 15.5% with avelumab versus chemotherapy, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.11; P = .1779).

As in other drugs, low solubility of these compounds has led to low bioavailability in target tissues. Enhanced drug dosages has effects such as toxicity, drug-drug interactions and increased drug resistance by fungi. This article reviews current state-of-art of antifungals, structure, mechanism of action, other usages, and toxic side effects. The emergence of nanoformulations to transport and uniformly release cargo at the target site is a boon in antifungal treatment. The article details research that lead to the development of nanoformulations of antifungals and potential advantages and avoidance of the lacunae characterizing conventional drugs. A range of nanoformulations based on liposomes, polymers are in various stages of research and their potential advantages have been brought out. It could be observed that under similar dosages, test models and duration, nanoformulations provided enhanced activity, reduced toxicity, higher uptake and higher immunostimulatory effects. In most instances the mechanism of antifungal activity of nanoformulations were similar to that of regular antifungal. There are possibilities of coupling multiple antifungals on the same nano-platform. Increased activity coupled with multiple mechanisms of action presents for nanoformulations a tremendous opportunity to overcome antifungal resistance. In the years to come robust methods for preparation of nanoformulations taking into account the repeatability and reproducibility in action, furthering the studies on nanoformulation toxicity and studies of human models are required prior to extensive use of nanoformulations as a prescribed drug.

Methods: We conducted an electronic search using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane through 24 July 2021. The inclusion criteria consisted of studies that examined the prevalence of allergic diseases in children with a previous diagnosis of KD and in a comparison group. We pooled studies by using a random effects model. The effects of KD on the subsequent risk of allergic diseases were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: We included a total of four studies that assessed the effect of KD on asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis vs. non-KD children (KD individuals for asthma, four studies, n = 8,474; allergic rhinitis, four studies, n = 8,474; atopic dermatitis, three studies, n = 8,330).

While the evolution of allometry has attracted much attention for centuries, our understanding of the developmental genetic mechanisms underlying its emergence remains fragmented. Here we conduct comparative transcriptomics of the legs followed by an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that play a role in the hyperallometric growth of the third legs in the males of the water strider Microvelia longipes. We demonstrate that a broadly expressed growth factor, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 11 (BMP11, also known as Growth Differentiation Factor 11), regulates leg allometries through increasing the allometric slope and mean body size in males. In contrast, BMP11 RNAi reduced mean body size but did not affect slope either in the females of M. longipes or in the males and females of other closely related Microvelia species. Furthermore, our data show that a tissue-specific factor, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), increases intercept without affecting mean body size. This indicates a genetic correlation between mean body size and variation in allometric slope, but not intercept. Strikingly, males treated with BMP11 RNAi exhibited a severe reduction in fighting frequency compared to both controls and Ubx RNAi-treated males. Therefore, male body size, the exaggerated weapon, and the intense fighting behavior associated with it are genetically correlated in M. longipes.

It has propelled the arbitration regime across the board in which virtual hearings have predominately replaced face-to-face hearings. As it remains uncertain whether it will be safe for parties to congregate in the same room, it is apparent that virtual arbitrations will continue to proliferate. To this end, many leading arbitral institutes have introduced guidelines and best practices for virtual hearings to ensure a fair and viable alternative to arbitrating in person.[1] Similarly, some jurisdictions have taken substantial steps in recognizing the validity of virtual hearing by producing rulings to circumvent a possible objection to the finality of award.[2] Whilst there is a growing acceptance of virtual hearing amongst the stakeholders of international arbitration, as a potent mechanism, there still exists a lingering concern over due process considerations pertaining to virtual hearings. Such concern may invite overzealous judicial scrutiny of the final award, undermining the expeditious and smooth resolution of the dispute. As such, if the parties elect to conduct a virtual hearing, it is even more critical to carefully tailor a dispute resolution clause that is suited to the specific characteristics of the virtual proceedings and ensure efficient resolution of the dispute.To this effect, this post aims to highlight key considerations to be factored in by parties when drafting a dispute resolution clause, which considers complications presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, existing measures of the research leadership do not take into account the intensity of leadership in the co-authorship network. More importantly, the spatial features, which influence the collaboration patterns and research outcomes, have not been incorporated in measuring the research leadership. To fill the gap, we construct an institution-level weighted co-authorship network that integrates two types of weight on the edges: the intensity of collaborations and the spatial score (the geographical distance adjusted by the cross-linguistic-border nature). Based on this network, we propose a novel metric, namely the spatial research leadership rank, to identify the leading institutions while considering both the collaboration intensity and the spatial features. The leadership of an institution is measured by the following three criteria: (a) the institution frequently plays the corresponding rule in papers with other institutions; (b) the institution frequently plays the corresponding rule in longer distance and even cross-linguistic-border collaborations; (c) the participating institutions led by the institution have high leadership status themselves. Harnessing a dataset of 323,146 journal publications in pharmaceutical sciences during 2010C2018, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the geographical distribution and dynamic patterns of research leadership flows at the institution level.

One of the most common and early symptoms of COVID-19 is fever which is the reaction to a disease-specific stimulus causing the increase of the human body temperature. To slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, the public is required have their body temperature measured when entering any premises. The current common method of monitoring the human body temperature uses the application of non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT) and is only limited for stationary conditions within short distances and mostly suitable for indoor premises. The available technology to detect human body temperature for longer distances uses the thermal camera which is costly and large. Thus, it is challenging to detect anyone with high body temperature is non-stationary conditions, at longer distances, especially outdoor. The project proposes an innovation to the current practice, for a wearable noncontact temperature detector device which is portable. The wearable non-contact temperature detector embeds a thermal sensor and a microcontroller to a normal hat. It is able to detect objects with higher temperature (37.5C) within 1 meter radius of 60 angle view in stationary and non-stationary conditions. The wearable device communicates via Bluetooth to a mobile device to display the detected temperature and notifies the user via alert message and alarm for high temperature detection. Display of the object's thermal image is also available with a resolution of 8 times 8 pixel. The wearable non-contact temperature detector is able to achieve 99% accuracy of temperature measurement for detection distance of up to 70 cm for indoor and within 20 cm for outdoor when tested with normal temperature subject and high temperature object and compared with the actual temperature detected via a commercial NCIT device. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Wearable Non-Contact Temperature Detector for Early Detection of Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective COVID-19 vaccine mandates are being implemented in health systems across the United States and the impact on the radiology department workforce and operations due to vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers is currently unknown.

It attempts to see if direct marketing via FPOs/FPCs helped Indian farmers to cope with adverse situations aroused in vegetable marketing. Design/methodology/approach: This study opted for mixed methods research. First, a granular data set comprising daily observation on wholesale price and the market arrival of vegetables were analysed. Descriptive statistics and Kalmogorov-Smirnov test were used to understand the severity of disruptions in the vegetable supply chain in India during the lockdown. Then, qualitative information from different stakeholders engaged in the vegetable marketing was collected through a phone survey and assessed using content analysis to comprehend how FPOs have helped farmers during this crisis. Findings: This paper confirms disruptions in the vegetable supply chain. Quantities of chosen vegetables arriving in the mandis were significantly lower than in the previous year for all phases of lockdown. Consequently, prices were much higher than in 2019C2020 for both the lockdown and subsequent phases unlock. Results further suggest that those farmers who are already in networks of FPOs/FPCs are able to get benefited. It was also observed that direct marketing through institutional supports is being more explored in the regions where FPOs/FPCs already exist. Research limitations/implications: Since it is an exploratory study involving a small sample, the research results may lack generalisability.

She had undergone her first dose of COVID-19 Moderna mRna vaccination just four days prior to her admission. She showed elevated HS troponin and elevated BNP at her laboratory exams. Her 12-lead ECG showed T wave inversion in the antero-lateral leads and prolongued QTc. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe ejection fraction reduction due to hypokinesia of the mid-apical segments of the anterior and lateral walls of the heart. The patient was then admitted to the Cardiology ward in order to perform a coronary angiography which sowed no significant coronary stenosis. She was started on appropriate medication and discharged after a six day in-hospital stay. At discharge she showed partial recovery of her ejection fraction (EF 44%). A cardiac magnetic resonance was performed after discharge which showed no late gadolinium enhancement. Such finding allowed us to rule out the diagnosis of myocarditis. Moreover at her 3-month follow-up her ejection fraction had recovered completely. We concluded for the diagnosis of Takotsubo Syndrome secondary to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a case of Takotsubo syndrome after vaccination with the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19. Two other similar case reports can be found in current medical literature.

We find that nighttime light intensity was 9.3% lower in the post period (May to July 2020) for districts with the most severe restrictions, (which could imply between 12.4% and 18.6% lower GDP), and 1.5% lower for districts with intermediate restrictions, compared to districts with the least restrictions. The differences were largest in May during the graded lockdown, and slowly tapered in June and July. Lower household income and consumption are plausible channels for these results. Stricter containment measures had larger impacts in districts with greater population density, older residents, and more services employment.

When SILS is performed via the transumbilical route, the resultant abdominal wound is hidden and the cosmetic outcome is better. However, because of the small angle of manipulation and difficulty in liver traction, this technique is not used to perform complex bariatric surgery. In this prospective study, we used our novel technique, which involves the use of a liver-suspension tape and umbilicoplasty of an omega-shaped incision (omega umbilicoplasty), to perform laparoscopic bariatric surgery via the single-incision transumbilical (SITU) approach. We then assessed the safety and effectiveness of our surgical technique. METHODS We started performing and developing this technique from December 2008. Until July 2009, 40 consecutive patients underwent 40 bariatric procedures: two adjustable gastric band placements, six sleeve gastrectomies, and 32 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations, including five cases where concomitant cholecystectomy was performed. RESULTS The mean operation time was 93.4 min and the mean duration of postoperative hospitalization was 1.15 days. No perioperative or postoperative complications or deaths occurred. Most patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSION Our technique can be safely and effectively used for SITU laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

The objective of this study was to assess short-term adverse events (AEs) of HCQ in HCWs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study among consenting HCWs taking prophylaxis and working in hospitals with COVID-19 patients used online forms to collect details of HCWs, comorbidities, prophylactic drugs used and AEs after the first dose of HCQ. Verification of dose and AEs was done by personal contact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the effect of age, gender and dose of HCQ on AE. RESULTS: Of the 1303 HCWs included, 98.4 per cent (n=1282) took HCQ and 66 per cent (n=861) took 800 mg as first day's dose. Among the 19.9 per cent (n=259) reporting AEs, 1.5 per cent (n=20) took treatment for AE, none were hospitalized and three discontinued HCQ. Gastrointestinal AEs were the most common (172, 13.2%), with less in older [odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.89], with more in females (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.78-3.38) and in those taking a total dose of 800 mg on day one compared to a lower dose.

This paper aims to examine how the design of a residential course was adapted to an online context and how this adaptation may prove beneficial to future iterations of the course. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis centers on a masters-level course in which students design software to support learning. One of the major changes to the course revolves around the transition from a traditional rubric-based grading scheme to a specifications grading system. This latter approach provides a series of binary (pass/fail) requirements (specifications) that students must meet to pass. Various forms of interactions were also altered during the transition; the authors investigate these in the paper. Findings: This study found that the move to specifications grading helped students and the instructor to focus on the important work of meeting course learning goals. The approach also aligned well with authentic scenarios in which software projects are tested against certain specifications. Finally, this study concludes that thinking about specifications grading in the future can help us to develop more resilient pedagogical design approaches that respond to various forms of disruptions and changes.

Seroconversion rates after 2 doses were 85% and 54% in patients with SM and HM, respectively. A lower proportion of patients had detectable NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 VOC (Alpha 62%, Beta 54%, Delta 49%) vs WT (84%), with corresponding significantly lower NAbT. Patients with HM were more likely to have an undetectable NAb and had lower NAbT vs solid malignancies to both WT and VOCs. Seroconversion showed poor concordance with NAbTs against VOCs. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted NAbT including against VOCs. Anti-CD20 treatment was associated with severely diminished NAbTs. Vaccine-induced T-cell responses were detected in 80% of patients, with no differences between vaccines or cancer types. Conclusions: Patients with HM had blunted humoural responses to infection and vaccination, particularly against VOCs, but preserved cellular responses might contribute to protection.

The virus has been shown to rely on the actions of TMPRSS2 (a serine protease), as well as FURIN (a peptidase), for the critical priming of its spike protein. It has been postulated that variations in the sequence and expression of SARS-CoV-2s receptor (ACE2) and the two priming proteases (TMPRSS2 and FURIN) may be critical in contributing to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This study aims to examine the different expression levels of FURIN in various tissues and age ranges in light of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels using the LungMAP database. Furthermore, we retrieved expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of the three genes and their annotation. We analyzed the frequency of the retrieved variants in data from various populations and compared it to the Egyptian population. We highlight FURINs potential interplay with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and showcase a myriad of variants of the three genes that are differentially expressed across populations. Our findings provide insights into potential genetic factors that impact SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in different populations and shed light on the varying expression patterns of FURIN.","output":"Bioinformatics Analysis of Allele Frequencies and Expression Patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in Different Populations and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is known that pyrrolidinone derivates belong to a class of biologically active compounds with broad spectrum of biological actions. Nowadays, many scientists are making effort in the discovery of the more effective way to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause oxidative stress or to eliminate the harmful microorganisms from the organism in humans. Therefore, pyrrolidinones seem to be great candidates for the investigations this field. METHODS The antimicrobial activity of tested compounds was estimated by the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration by the broth micro-dilution method against four species of bacteria and five species of fungi. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging and reducing power. RESULTS Among the tested compounds, P22 showed marked antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC value of 0.312 mg/mL. Maximum antifungal activity with MIC value 0.625 mg/mL was shown by P23 and P25 compounds against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Tested samples showed a relatively strong scavenging activity on DPPH radical (IC50 ranged from 166.75-727.17 g/mL). The strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity was shown by the P3 compound with an IC50 value of 166.75 g/mL. Moreover, the tested compounds had effective reducing power. Compounds P3, P10, and P13 showed the highest reducing power than those from the other samples. Results of the interactions between DNA or BSA and P3 indicated that P3 had the affinity to displace EB from the EB-DNA complex through intercalation [Ksv = (1.4  0.1)  105 M-1], while Ka values obtained via titration of BSA with P23 or P25 [Ka = (6.2  0.2) and (5.0  0.2)  105 M-1] indicate that the notable quantity of the drug can be transmitted to the cells.

The available literature data derived from controlled studies or usage in a medical setting seem reassuring; however the literature contains very rare cases of fatal self-inflicted injuries associated with LSD exposure. The behavioral disorder that created the conditions conducive to death is a maladaptive or irrational response to the psychiatric manifestations induced by the substance. PATIENT CONCERN: Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old man found dead with large neck wounds in a locked house. No medical history other than recreational use of alcohol and narcotics was reported as well as any history of psychotic disease. The entirety of the other investigations carried out did not demonstrate the presence of a third party at the place of death and a dropper bottle containing LSD was found near the body. DIAGNOSIS: We report the first case of fatal self-inflicted neck wounds with a cutting instrument in the context of acute exposure to LSD in a patient with no psychiatric history and without suicidal symptoms at the time of the self-aggressive act. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: In the present work, we used a validated method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for simultaneous quantification of LSD and its metabolites (O-H-LSD and Nor-LSD) in whole blood and urine samples. LSD and O-H-LSD were respectively found at 1460 and 182apg/mL in blood. In the urine, the concentrations of LSD, nor-LSD, O-H-LSD were, respectively, 3670, 201, and 4890ang/L. LESSONS: This observation is particularly relevant in view of the resurgence of interest in the therapeutic use of LSD, notwithstanding the fact that the literature has not demonstrated a link between suicidal risk and acute or chronic exposure to LSD.","output":"Self-inflicted neck wounds under influence of lysergic acid diethylamide: A case report and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe situation caused by THE COVID-19 epidemic has not only hindered the steady development of social economy, but also had a great impact on the development of e-commerce logistics.

Human rhinoviruses, which cause almost two-thirds of colds, have demonstrated temperature-dependent replication which is optimal between 33C and 35C. METHODS: This randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial completed at a single-centre in New Zealand, recruited 170 participants aged 18C75 years (mean age 27.5 years) who were within 48 hours of common cold symptom onset and had a symptom score (the Modified Jackson Score (MJS)) 7 and a negative point-of-care test for influenza. Participants were blinded to the intervention and randomised (1:1) to 5 days of either nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF) (100% humidified air delivered at 35 L/min and 41C for 2 hours daily) (n=85) or sham rhinothermy (100% humidified air delivered at 10 L/min and 31C for 10 min daily) (n=85) and completed daily symptom diaries, which included the MJS, for 14 days, to investigate whether rNHF reduced common cold symptom severity and duration compared with sham rhinothermy. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat superiority analysis included all randomised participants and showed no difference between treatment groups for the primary outcome, the day 4 MJS analysed by analysis of covariance: mean (SD) 6.33 (3.97) for rNHF vs 5.8 (3.15) for sham; estimated difference (95% CI) 0.37 (?0.69 to 1.42), p=0.49. There was no difference in time until resolution of symptoms: mean (SD) 5.96 (4.47) days for rNHF vs 6.42 (4.09) days for sham; estimated difference (95% CI) 1.02 (0.75 to 1.38), p=0.91. There were no serious adverse events related to the study treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This well-powered, single-blind randomised controlled trial does not provide evidence that 5 days of rNHF (100% humidified air heated to 41C delivered at 35 L/min for 2 hours daily) reduces common cold symptom severity or duration.

However, it is challenging for users to choose the proper one from existing paper-based NAE materials for specific POC applications, which is determined by their physical and chemical properties. Additionally, building the relationship between the physical and chemical properties and the NAE efficiency of paper-based materials is instructive for development of new paper-based NAE materials. In this study, we first systematically compared the physical and chemical properties of six widely used paper-based NAE materials (namely Whatman filter paper #1, FTA card, FTA elute card, Fusion 5, silica membrane and polyethersulfone (PES) membrane), and then evaluated their NAE efficiency. The obtained results indicated that pore uniformity, wet strength, porosity and functional groups are key parameters to affect the efficiency of NAE. The NAE performance of FTA card is the best with high concentration and purity.

The associated maternal factors were meconium-stained amniotic fluid and urinary tract infection. Insufficient prenatal check-ups were found in 58.8% (30/51). The most associated neonatal factor was sepsis. The main symptoms were fever, irritability, hypoactivity and respiratory distress. Pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was significant, without predominance of polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMN), hypoglycorrhagia and proteinorrhagia. The most frequent pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS The hospital incidence of neonatal meningitis was 1.4 per 1000 live births, being ten times higher in preterm infants.

A total of 100 tracheal and kidney tissue specimens from different commercial broiler flocks in the middle and south of Iraq were collected from September 2013 to September 2014. Thirty-two IBV-positive samples were selected from among the total and were further characterized by nested PCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong to four groups (group I, variant 2 [IS/1494-like]; group II, 793/B-like; group III, QX-like; group IV, DY12-2-like). Sequence analysis revealed nucleotide sequence identities within groups I, II, and III of 99.68 %-100 %, 99.36 %-100 %, and 96.42 %-100 %, respectively. Group I (variant 2) was the dominant IBV genotype. One Chinese-like recombinant virus (DY12-2-like) that had not been reported in the Middle East was detected.

Among others, the proposed method accommodates multinomial and can be adapted to accommodate compositional responses on $k=d+1$ categories, while preserving the sequential aspect of the Bayesian inferential procedure, producing real-time inference. The updating scheme benefits from the conjugate structure in the exponential family, assuring computational efficiency. Concepts such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and the projection theorem are used in the development of the method, placing it close to recent approaches on variational inference.

The study also included patients who did not meet standard inclusion criteria for endovascular treatment: low or high baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 80 years of age, extensive ischemic signs in middle cerebral artery territory, and time from symptom onset to endovascular intervention>8 hours. METHODS Consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation stroke treated with the Solitaire FR were analyzed. Data on characteristics of endovascular interventions, complications, and clinical outcome were collected prospectively. Patients who met standard inclusion criteria were compared with those who did not. RESULTS A total of 227 patients were included. Mean age was 68.214.7 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 16 (range, 2-36).

We developed a dynamic online infrastructure together with a dedicated implementation team to deliver this at scale and pace. The guideline was implemented through a digital implementation framework (SIMPSI framework) deploying facilitators to maximise guideline adoption, particularly targeting senior clinical decision makers (consultants) involved with the care of COVID-infected patients across six Health Boards (HB) in Wales. Methods We evaluated guideline implementation using the Taxonomy of Implementation Outcomes Model. The primary outcome was consultant engagement, with a target of 193 registrations. We assessed wider impact through analysis of guideline platform activity and a user survey, with additional sensitivity analysis to derive penetration ratios, catchment population, clinical staff, acute beds, and COVID-19 admissions. ResultsThe guideline platform had 4521 total registrants, with over 170,000 page views during the first wave. We exceeded the target nearly six-fold (1159 consultant registrants). This represented 45% of all medical consultants in Wales, and made up the highest proportion of guideline registrants of all professional groups (23%, 1159/4521). We observed significant variation in guideline penetration across the six HBs, ranging from 31% to 74% of consultants registered. The HB with highest penetration had the most active guideline facilitator. The HB with the lowest penetration was the region first impacted and most affected by COVID-19 at the time of guideline publication (37% inpatients of peak, versus 10% or less for the other HBs). ConclusionWe utilised a digital implementation framework to construct a system that could be rapidly applied throughout all hospitals in Wales. Whilst we exceeded the intended target demonstrating full implementation, we identified two key factors to account for differences in the penetration rates across the different HBs. First, an experienced and active facilitator with the capacity to undertake the role was associated with significantly better penetration. Second, timeliness of implementation was crucial as evidenced by lower penetrance is the one HB that was impacted earliest by COVID-19 at the time of guideline dissemination. Nevertheless, the rapid implementation of the guideline has coincided with Wales demonstrating more favourable intensive care survival rates and maintaining one of the lowest mortality rates when compared to the UK as a whole for the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Evaluating the Implementation of a National COVID-19 Hospital Guideline in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Poorly organized health systems with inadequate leadership limit the development of the robust safety cultures capable of preventing consequential adverse events. Although safety culture has been studied in hospitals worldwide, the relationship between clinician perceptions about patient safety and their actual clinical practices has received little attention. Despite the need for mixed methods studies to achieve a deeper understanding of safety culture, there are few studies providing comparisons of hospitals in different countries. PURPOSE: This study compared the safety culture of hospitals from the perspective of nurses in four European countries, including Croatia, Hungary, Spain, and Sweden. DESIGN: A comparative mixed methods study with a convergent parallel design. METHODS: Data collection included a survey, participant interviews, and workplace observations. The sample was nurses working in the internal medicine, surgical, and emergency departments of two public hospitals from each country. Survey data (n = 538) was collected with the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) and qualitative date was collected through 24 in-depth interviews and 147 h of non-participant observation. Survey data was analyzed descriptively and inferentially, and content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: The overall perception of safety culture for most dimensions was 'adequate' in Sweden and 'adequate' to 'poor' in the other countries with inconsistencies identified between survey and qualitative data. Although teamwork within units was the most positive dimension across countries, the qualitative data did not consistently demonstrate support, respect, and teamwork as normative attributes in Croatia and Hungary. Staffing and workload were identified as major areas for improvement across countries, although the nurse-to-patient ratios were the highest in Sweden, followed by Spain, Hungary, and Croatia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite all countries being part of the European Union, most safety culture dimensions require improvement, with few measured as good, and most deemed to be adequate to poor. Dimension level perceptions were at times incongruent across countries, as observed patient safety practices or interview perspectives were inconsistent with a positive safety culture. Differences between countries may be related to national culture or variability in health system structures permitted by the prevailing European Union health policy.","output":"Patient Safety Culture in European Hospitals: A Comparative Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reliable transportation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patient samples from a swabbing station to a diagnostics facility is essential for the generation of accurate results.

SARS-CoV-2-positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium were exposed to different temperatures (4C, 25C, and 35C) and to repetitive freeze-thawing, to assess the effect of storage conditions on reverse transcriptase PCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still reliably detected by reverse transcriptase PCR after 21 days of storage in viral transport medium, even when the samples had been stored at 35C. The change of Ct value per day was 0.023 to 0.046 (0.018 to 0.019). In addition, viral RNA was still detected after 15 freeze-thaw cycles, with a change of Ct value of 0.106 to 0.197 (0.009 to 0.061) per freeze-thaw cycle.

We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID\\\\non\\\\AP) and non\\\\COVID patients with AP (non\\\\COVID\\\\AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID\\\\19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72, 95%CI=0.54\\\\0.94). This frequency was lower than in non\\\\COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61, 95%CI=1.54\\\\1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34\\\\0.58).

In\\\\hospital mortality of COVID\\\\AP does not differ from COVID\\\\non\\\\AP but is higher than non\\\\COVID\\\\AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.","output":"A case\\\\control emergency department\\\\based analysis of acute pancreatitis in Covid\\\\19: Results of the UMC\\\\19\\\\S(6)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a lack of clarity regarding management of COVID-19 infection in children. This review aims to summarize the key clinical presentations and management of Pediatric COVID-19. The Medline database was searched for seminal articles and guidelines on COVID-19 presentation and management in children less than 18 years of age. COVID-19 has a lower incidence (15% of reported cases worldwide), causes milder disease with lower need for intensive care admission and lower mortality rate (00.7%) in children compared with adults. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but severe complication in children. Majority of patients require supportive care including adequate hydration, nutrition and antipyretics. Supplemental oxygen therapy should be given in moderate to severe cases with all precautions to prevent air-borne COVID-19 spread. Steroids may be helpful in severe cases. Anticoagulation is indicated in moderate to severe cases with risk factors. More data on the efficacy and safety of antivirals and immunomodulators in children is needed.","output":"Pediatric Coronavirus Disease 2019: Clinical Features and Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron; CAS No. 102-54-5) is a relatively volatile, organometallic compound used as a chemical intermediate, a catalyst, and as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased body-weight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene- and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls, while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights, and an increase in thymus weights, relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposure-related gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates, lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation. Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration. In vitro metabolism studies of ferrocene showed that nasal tissue, particularly the olfactory epithelium, had  10 times higher ferrocene hydroxylating activity than did liver tissue from the same animals. These results suggest that the mechanism of ferrocene toxicity may be the intracellular release of ferrous ion through ferrocene metabolism, followed by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes.","output":"Two-week, repeated inhalation exposure of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ferrocene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interactions with host defences are key aspects of viral infection. Various viral proteins perform counter-defensive functions, but a distinct class, called security proteins, is dedicated specifically to counteracting host defences. Here, the properties of the picornavirus security proteins L and 2A are discussed. These proteins have well-defined positions in the viral polyprotein, flanking the capsid precursor, but they are structurally and biochemically unrelated. Here, we consider the impact of these two proteins, as well as that of a third security protein, L(*), on viral reproduction, pathogenicity and evolution. The concept of security proteins could serve as a paradigm for the dedicated counter-defensive proteins of other viruses.

This study used the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) method to analyze the transmission rate of COVID-19 in different sporting models, sporting spaces per capita, and situations of gathering, which contributes to understanding how COVID-19 transmits in sports facilities. The simulation results show that the transmission rate of COVID-19 was higher under the Fixed Movement Route (FMR) than under the Unfixed Movement Route (UMR) in 10 different sporting spaces per capita (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 m(2)) (p = 0.000). For both FMR and UMR, the larger the sporting space per capita, the lower the virus transmission rate. Additionally, when the sporting space per capita increases from 4 m(2) to 5 m(2), the virus transmission rate decreases most significantly (p = 0.000). In the FMR model with a per capita sporting space of 5 m(2), minimizing gathering (no more than three people) could significantly slow down the transmission rate of the COVID-19 virus (p < 0.05). This study concluded that: (1) The UMR model is suggested in training facilities or playing grounds; (2) The sporting space should be non-overcrowding, and it is recommended that the sporting space per capita in the sporting grounds should not be less than 5 m(2); (3) It is important to maintain safe social distancing and minimize gathering (no more than three people) when exercising.","output":"Unfixed Movement Route Model, Non-Overcrowding and Social Distancing Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 in Sporting Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To slow down the proliferation of Covid-19, governments virtually shut down public life, temporarily closed schools, and forced teaching to be done exclusively on a remote basis.

However, the use of HCD to improve the quality of team science is a relatively recent application, and its benefits and challenges have not been rigorously evaluated. We conducted a qualitative study with health sciences researchers trained in HCD methods. We aimed to determine how researchers applied HCD methods and perceived the benefits and barriers to using HCD on research teams. METHODS: We conducted 1-hour, semi-structured interviews with trainees from three training cohorts. Interviews focused on perceptions of the training, subsequent uses of HCD, barriers and facilitators, and perceptions of the utility of HCD to science teams. Data analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarkes process for thematic analysis. RESULTS: We interviewed nine faculty and nine staff trained in HCD methods and identified four themes encompassing HCD use, benefits, challenges, and tensions between HCD approaches and academic culture. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found HCD relevant to research teams for stakeholder engagement, research design, project planning, meeting facilitation, and team management. They also described benefits of HCD in five distinct areas: creativity, egalitarianism, structure, efficiency, and visibility. Our data suggest that HCD has the potential to help researchers work more inclusively and collaboratively on interdisciplinary teams and generate more innovative and impactful science. The application of HCD methods is not without challenges; however, we believe these challenges can be overcome with institutional investment.","output":"Assessing the application of human-centered design to translational research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Emergency Department in Trondheim has prepared for a large influx of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database. Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed. RESULTS In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10. There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department. In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients. INTERPRETATION There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic. The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients. The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.","output":"Patient visits to an emergency department in anticipation of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Raw milk is a significant vehicle for the transmission of different infections. In the present study, we focused on Salmonella enterica from raw milk and its resistance to various antibacterial drugs. Furthermore, we have investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of essential oil (EO) obtained from Salvia officinalis L. leaves that were collected from the Aljouf region, Saudi Arabia, against S. enterica. One-dozen strains of S. enterica were found in a batch of a hundred milk samples, and those S. enterica strains were shown to be resistant to several antibiotics, particularly the -lactam group of antimicrobial drugs. Against multidrug-resistant S. enterica, the inhibitory zones for EO from S. officinalis leaves were found to be 21 mm in diameter. S. officinalis EO at 5% concentration showed a remarkable in vitro inhibitory activity toward the biofilm growth of different S. enterica isolates. Analysis of EO by GCCMS identified 21 distinct components, accounting for 89.94% of the total oil component. The most prominent compounds were 1,8-cineole (39.18%), -caryophyllene (12.8%), and --terpineol (10.3%). Taken together, our results unequivocally confirm that the S. officinalis EOs exert numerous bioactivities.

This is particularly true in panel data comprised of many cross-sectional units, such as individuals, firms or countries, which are all affected by major events. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most sectors of the global economy, and there is by now plenty of evidence to support this. The impact on stock markets is, however, still unclear. The fact that most markets seem to have partly recovered while the pandemic is still ongoing suggests that the relationship between stock returns and COVID-19 has been subject to structural change. It is therefore important to know if a structural break has occurred and, if it has, to infer the date of the break. In the present paper we take this last observation as a source of motivation to develop a new break detection toolbox that is applicable to different sized panels, easy to implement and robust to general forms of unobserved heterogeneity. The toolbox, which is the first of its kind, includes a test for structural change, a break date estimator, and a break date confidence interval. Application to a panel covering 61 countries from January 3 to September 25, 2020, leads to the detection of a structural break that is dated to the first week of April. The effect of COVID-19 is negative before the break and zero thereafter, implying that while markets did react, the reaction was short-lived. A possible explanation for this is the quantitative easing programs announced by central banks all over the world in the second half of March.","output":"Structural Breaks in Interactive Effects Panels and the Stock Market Reaction to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the Atterberg limits tests (ASTM D4318 Standard Test Methods for Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils) are visualized by creating a game that presents a virtual soil lab environment via MATLAB App Designer. The environment consists of a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing students to gain hands-on experience on the test. In this environment, a specimen can be prepared by adding water to soils, then placed into a virtual Casagrande apparatus enhanced by animations and sound effects. After that, a groove tool is used, and the apparatus is operated as if it was used in reality. The number of drops is counted to obtain the liquid limit of the soil. While performing these procedures, the virtual laboratory automatically generates some soil properties with randomized features, focusing solely on the processes rather than the measurements and calculations. Moreover, continuous feedback is provided, such as the rotation speed or the suitability of the different specimens with distinct water contents. In determining the plastic limit, kneading and rolling actions are driven by mouse clicks. The plastic limit is obtained after the roll is crumbled. The soil is then classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) plasticity chart. With its randomized nature, the game aims to create a realistic laboratory experience. The game is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevents most students from joining laboratory sessions essential for understanding experimental soil mechanics. The authors believe that this game will allow students to perform each step of an experiment, which sometimes cannot be achieved in laboratories due to time constraints. In addition, the game will likely engage students to a commonly performed soil mechanics test by pre-test quizzes, feedback, and visualizing features.

However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis.

Serum anti-heart (AHA) and anti-intercalated disk autoantibodies (AIDA) are organ and disease-specific markers of isolated autoimmune myocarditis. We assessed frequencies, clinical correlates, and prognostic impacts of AHA and AIDA in SSc. Methods: The study included consecutive SSc patients (n = 116, aged 53  13 years, 83.6% females, median disease duration 7 years) with clinically suspected heart involvement (symptoms, abnormal ECG, abnormal troponin I or natriuretic peptides, and abnormal echocardiography). All SSc patients underwent CMR. Serum AHA and AIDA were measured by indirect immunofluorescence in SSc and in control groups of non-inflammatory cardiac disease (NICD) (n = 160), ischemic heart failure (IHF) (n = 141), and normal blood donors (NBD) (n = 270). AHA and AIDA status in SSc was correlated with baseline clinical, diagnostic features, and outcome. Results: The frequency of AHA was higher in SSc (57/116, 49%, p < 0.00001) than in NICD (2/160, 1%), IHF (2/141, 1%), or NBD (7/270, 2.5%). The frequency of AIDA was higher (65/116, 56%, p < 0.00001) in SSc than in NICD (6/160, 3.75%), IHF (3/141, 2%), or NBD (1/270, 0.37%).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 6 292 800 veterans in VHA care at 130 VHA medical facilities. We assessed the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 administered by the VHA (n = 822 934) and the number of positive test results (n = 82 094) from February 8 through December 28, 2020. We evaluated associations of COVID-19 testing and test positivity with demographic characteristics of veterans, adjusting for facility characteristics, comorbidities, and county-level area-based socioeconomic measures using nested generalized linear models. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, veterans who were female, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, urban, and low income and had a disability had an increased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test, and veterans who were Asian had a decreased likelihood of obtaining a COVID-19 test. Compared with veterans who were White, veterans who were Black/African American (risk ratio [RR] = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (RR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21) had an increased likelihood of receiving a positive test result. Hispanic/Latino veterans had a 43% higher likelihood of receiving a positive test result than non-Hispanic/Latino veterans did. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterans have access to subsidized health care at the VHA, the increased risk of receiving a positive test result for COVID-19 among Black and Hispanic/Latino veterans, despite receiving more tests than White and non-Hispanic/Latino veterans, suggests that other factors (eg, social inequities) are driving disparities in COVID-19 prevalence.","output":"Differences in COVID-19 Testing and Test Positivity Among Veterans, United States, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused strain on hospital systems and potential delay in diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D).

This recognition spurred interest in adopting inclusive and equitable research practices across industry and the clinical research ecosystem in general. Between 2018-2021, regulatory bodies, professional organizations, and working groups issued policy and/or recommendations outlining measures that support the conduct of inclusive and equitable clinical trials. We applied previously published multi-themed strategies, multi-stakeholder recommendations, and calls to action by surveying industry to document baseline practices towards equitable clinical trial representation in the US. Research Question: What strategies are industry leaders deploying to increase diversity in clinical trials? Methods: Using a 4-staged approach, we first identified 48 success factors sourced from 12 documents. This analysis included previously documented measures that are both inclusive of diverse populations as well as practices that facilitate insights from diverse communities. Second, a survey tool was developed that organized the individual success factors into 6 categories with one open-ended question on ecosystem changes;survey measures and 4 choices for each factor were Actively implementing, Recommended to be implemented, No plans to implement, and No answer. Third, the survey was administered between April 10-30, 2021, to 12 pharmaceutical companies all having a proven external commitment to health equity in oncology and all are represented on the 2021 1Q Biopharma top 25 by Market Cap report. Fourth, responses were anonymized and aggregated;results were provided to respondents. Results: The response rate was 67% (8/12). Responders indicated success factors across two major implementation categories as follows: actively implemented (51%);recommended/planned for implementation (44%). No responders added any additional success factors via free text. Being actively implemented was highest for the 3 categories site selection (78%), general capabilities (72%), leadership (53%). Recommended/planned for implementation was highest for the 3 categories participant focused (50%), other factors (50%), racial and ethnic minority group data (REMG) (48%). Conclusions: Pharmaceutical companies reported active implementation of success factors sourced from public documents across all categories. As an example, stakeholders have generally considered thoughtful site selection an important measure to enroll diverse representation in clinical trials as it may mitigate access barriers to participation. In the site selection category, the survey reported 7/8 companies were actively implementing three measures and 5/8 were actively implementing two measures.

Attempts or death by suicide, challenge mental health actions, require specialized practices within organizations. This study aims to describe an innovative initiative in occupational health in the oil industry in Brazil, addressing Suicide Postvention in the Workplace. METHODS: Using an epistemological basis of working with groups; psychology in emergencies and disasters; mourning elaboration, an attempt was made to systematize the specialized intervention in mental health within suicide assistance, workplace adapted. It relates an intervention-action in 5 occurrences during the year 2020, with the participation of an interdisciplinary health team including social workers, psychologists, physicians and nurses. Individual care, group approaches, leaders advice and family members support, was provided. RESULTS: An average of 20 individual consultations were carried out for each occurrence, 7 interventions with groups. In 4 of the cases, direct approaches from the interdisciplinary team with family members were necessary. The implantation allowed to structure the intervention in suicide emergencies; methodological legitimation; ensuring innovation in emergency mental health practice; prevention of contagious suicide; monitoring of critical cases; and continuity of support in mental health through internal and external network.

This study examined the discussion of T21 laws in top-circulating print media sources in the U.S. between 2012 and 2020. METHODS: Systematic database searches using Access World News and Factiva identified T21 related news articles appearing in the top daily circulating newspapers in each state between January 2012 and December 2020 (n=586 articles). Content analyses documented prevalence, types of articles and context related to framing of arguments for or against T21 laws. RESULTS: Newspaper coverage of T21 was highest in 2019 (42.8% of articles). The majority were news/features (75.4%) followed by editorials/opinions (24.6%) which largely supported T21. Most articles focused on state or local T21 action. Coverage of federal T21 increased in 2019. The most common argument supporting T21 included reducing youth tobacco prevalence (64.8%) while the most frequent objection was freedom infringement (25.1%). Tobacco and vape industries began voicing support for T21 in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: News coverage of state level T21 in the U.S. began to increase in 2015 and peaked in 2019 with enactment of federal T21, a newsworthy event. As states adopt and amend T21 laws to align with federal law, advocates can use media to help shape the narrative and encourage strong T21 policies. IMPLICATIONS: This study described the volume and content of Tobacco 21 print media coverage from 2012 to 2020, including common arguments used to support and oppose Tobacco 21. Arguments in support of Tobacco 21 included reducing youth tobacco use, particularly use of e-cigarettes, and related health effects while arguments against Tobacco 21 focused on individual rights. Support for Tobacco 21 reached a tipping point in 2019, including the tobacco industry's reversal in opposing such laws. States can and should continue to improve existing T21 laws and policies and increase public awareness about critical policy components such as inspection procedures and penalties.","output":"Can states continue to set the agenda for Tobacco 21?

Methods: A cross-sectional study, with 293 university students was performed by using a validated questionnaire to measure beliefs and behaviour regarding health. Results: The lifestyle pattern of the nursing students evaluated was characterised by a high percentage of nurses with low levels of physical activity, poor balanced diet and smoking habits. The comparative analysis showed no significant differences between nursing students and students from other degrees. Conclusions: Students have a positive attitude and knowledge about healthy lifestyle, but do not transfer it to their own lives. Nurses lifestyle can unintentionally affect the behaviour of other people through their own behaviour and beliefs because they serve as a model for a healthy lifestyle.

These macroeconomic intervention measures along with aggregate demand and supply shocks and policy choices would affect the exporting environment of a country through many channels. Therefore, to analyze any post COVID pandemic inefficiencies generated due to the governments policy choices to minimize the impact of COVID, it is important to distinguish the already inherent inefficiencies in the exporting environment to provide a baseline line for comparative purposes. This study investigates the prevalence of inefficiencies during the post GFC period (2010-18) in India. A stochastic frontier gravity model is employed to determine the existence of inefficiencies, its pattern over time and the level of efficiency with respect to each partner country. The first stage found that inefficiencies were already present in the post GFC period, which has increased over time. In the second stage, structural equation modelling was employed with each country efficiency level as dependent variable and five dimensions of the Economic Freedom Index (EFI) as explanatory variables for India and at an aggregate level for importing countries. The second stage found that sound money dimension of EFI affected adversely the exporting environment of India during the period of analysis, which can be mainly attributed to the November 2016 sudden implementation of the demonetization policy by the Indian Government without any prior arrangements for smooth transition to the post policy change situation.","output":"Post Global Financial Crisis Export Inefficiencies of India: a Baseline for Post COVID Analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerged coronavirus, and has been pandemic since March 2020 and led to many fatalities.

To examine this, the study employs bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the 10 models.

The US is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country than the increase in the number of cases.

Thus, understanding the effects of climate on grapevine performance in Israel may be a test case for the effect of climate change on grapevine at other areas in the future. First, we present a preliminary survey (2012-2014) in different climate zones and terroirs, which showed that trans-resveratrol concentrations in Merlot and Shiraz were high, while those of Cabernet Sauvignon were significantly lower. A further comprehensive countrywide survey (2016) of Merlot wines from 62 vineyards (53 wineries) compared several phenolic compounds' concentrations between five areas of different climate and terroir. Results show a connection between trans-resveratrol concentrations, variety, and terroir properties.

It has been suggested that its mode of action requires the host immune system, as it is difficult to reproduce its clinical efficacy in vitro. We therefore studied the effects of a single dose of ivermectin (Stromectol(?)0.15 mg/kg) on cytokine levels and immune cell gene expression in human volunteers. This dose reduces bloodstream microfilariae rapidly and for several months when given in mass drug administration programmes. METHODS: Healthy volunteers with no travel history to endemic regions were given 3C4 tablets, depending on their weight, of either ivermectin or a placebo. Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to administration, 4 h and 24 h afterwards, and complete blood counts performed. Serum levels of 41 cytokines and chemokines were measured using Luminex(?) and expression levels of 770 myeloid-cell-related genes determined using the NanoString nCounter(?). Cytokine levels at 4 h and 24 h post-treatment were compared to the levels pre-treatment using simple t tests to determine if any individual results required further investigation, taking p = < 0.05 as the level of significance. NanoString data were analysed on the proprietary software, nSolver?. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in complete blood counts or cytokine levels at either time point between people given ivermectin versus placebo. Only three genes showed a significant change in expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 4 h after ivermectin was given; there were no significant changes 24 h after drug administration or in polymorphonuclear cells at either time point. Leukocytes isolated from those participants given ivermectin showed no difference in their ability to kill Brugia malayi microfilariae in vitro.

To investigate the role of this vitamin against the Coronavirus, this study analyzed the serum levels of vitamin D, the transcription pattern of inflammatory cytokines, and the frequency of total lymphocytes, TCD4(+), TCD8(+), and NK cells in 50 COVID-19-affected subjects in comparison to 50 healthy participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study diagnosed and evaluated 100 patients. Frequency of lymphocytes was determined using flow cytometry. Cytokine expression levels were measured using Real-Time PCR. Serum levels of vitamin D and cytokines levels in cultured cell supernatant were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 exhibited decreased serum levels of vitamin D versus the healthy participants (p = 0.0024). The total number of lymphocytes, TCD4(+), TCD8(+), and NK cells was significantly reduced in patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.0001). Considerable upregulation of IL-12, IFN-, and TNF- was seen in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group, whereas IFN- was downregulated in COVID-19 patients. ELISA results also had increased levels of IL-12, TNF-, and IFN- (p = 0.0014, 0.0012, and p < 0.0001, respectively), and decreased level of IFN- (p = 0.0021) in patients with COVID-19 compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a probable association among vitamin D concentrations, immune system function, and risk of COVID-19 infection. As a result, it is recommended that vitamin D be considered as a candidate for handling and controlling COVID-19 because of its ability to target the cytokine storm and its antiviral effects.","output":"Serum levels of vitamin D and immune system function in patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can lead to multiple deleterious outcomes and has negative, sometimes debilitating, impacts on general functioning of those affected.

The UK-Latin America Brain Connectivity Research Network (UL-BCRN) focuses on developing new affordable EEG-based biomarkers for dementia. The Language and Brain Health Network (LBHN) integrate international multidisciplinary efforts to reveal linguistic markers of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS ReDLat is collecting genomic, neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and socioeconomic data from a first-in-class cohort anchored in six LAC (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru) and will compare these to US data (> 4200 participants, including 2100 controls, 1050 AD patients, and 1050 FTD patients). The 5-year project will develop innovative, harmonized, and cross-nation approaches on two of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The UL-BCRN currently links seven EEG labs from Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and the UK. The network's vision is to forge strong relationships between labs through which new methodologies, EEG plus multidimensional datasets, and experience will be developed and shared. The LBHN will analyze speech samples from massive AD, FTD, and control cohorts across LAC, Spain, and the US. This effort aims to identify low-cost disease-specific markers in diverse Latino and English-speaking patients. RESULTS ReDLat will aims to reveal unique risk factors for AD and FTD in LAC compared to US populations. Data collection strategies have been adapted to face the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. The UL-BCRN has now standardised recording protocols across LAC and UK labs and is collecting data from longitudinal cohorts of patients at risk of dementia relying on novel culture-free cognitive paradigms. Preliminary LBHN data shows that, automated speech analyses can identify Latinos with AD and FTD, with good generalization across socio-biological profiles, dialects, and languages. CONCLUSION By broadening our understanding of dementia phenotypes, risk factors, and affordable diagnostic approaches in LAC, adding new evidence on variability across HIC and LMIC, the above networks will contribute unique knowledge that will help enhance future global dementia strategies.","output":"Addressing dementia challenges through international networks: Evidence from the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to an overwhelming strain on healthcare delivery.

The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies.

Understanding precisely how the spread of the virus occurs from a territorial perspective is crucial not only to prevent further infections but also to help with policy design regarding human mobility. From the large spatial differences in the behavior of the virus spread we can unveil which areas have been more vulnerable to it and why, and with this information try to assess the risk that each community has to suffer a future outbreak of infection. In this work we have analyzed the geographical distribution of the cumulative incidence during the first wave of the pandemic in the region of Galicia (north western part of Spain), and developed a mathematical approach that assigns a risk factor for each of the different municipalities that compose the region.

Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. Materials and Method A total of 39 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFluTM database on March 29th 2020 to investigate its evolution in Nigeria. Sequences were selected based on the travel history of the patient and the collection date. Other sequences were not selected because they were short, contained artefacts, not from original source or had insufficient information. Evolutionary history was inferred using Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the common ancestor of each strain. Results The phylogenetic analysis showed the strain in Nigeria clustered in a monophyletic clade with a Wuhan sublineage. Nucleotide alignment also showed a 100% similarity indicating a common origin of evolution. Comparative analysis showed 27,972 (93.6%) identical sites and 97.6% pairwise identity with the consensus.

We sought to describe their natural history in previously hospitalised patients, compare this with controls, and assess the relationship between symptoms and cardiopulmonary impairment at 6 months post-COVID-19. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients and thirty matched controls (single visit), recruited between 14(th) March - 25(th) May 2020, underwent symptom-questionnaires, cardiac and lung magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and spirometry at 3 months following COVID-19. Of them, forty-six patients returned for follow-up assessments at 6 months. FINDINGS: At 2-3 months, 83% of patients had at least one cardiopulmonary symptom versus 33% of controls. Patients and controls had comparable biventricular volumes and function. Native cardiac T(1) (marker of fibroinflammation) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, marker of focal fibrosis) were increased in patients at 2-3 months. Sixty percent of patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on CMR and 55% had reduced peak oxygen consumption (pV?O(2)) on CPET. By 6 months, 52% of patients remained symptomatic. On CMR, indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-43 mls/m(2), P=0005) decreased and RV ejection fraction (+32%, P=00003) increased. Native T(1) and LGE improved and was comparable to controls. Lung parenchymal abnormalities and peak V?O(2), although better, were abnormal in patients versus controls. 31% had reduced pV?O(2) secondary to symptomatic limitation and muscular impairment. Cardiopulmonary symptoms in patients did not associate with CMR, lung function, or CPET measures. INTERPRETATION: In patients, cardiopulmonary abnormalities improve over time, though some measures remain abnormal relative to controls. Persistent symptoms at 6 months post-COVID-19 did not associate with objective measures of cardiopulmonary health.

Here, we show that BAG3 down-modulation resulted in reduced cell viability and enhanced PEITC-induced apoptosis largely more extensively in HeLa (HPV18(+)) rather than in C33A (HPV(?)) cervical carcinoma cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that BAG3 suppression led to a decrease of viral E6 oncoprotein and a concomitant recovery of p53 tumor suppressor, the best recognized target of E6 for proteasome degradation. E6 and p53 expression were modulated at protein level, since their respective mRNAs were unaffected. Taken together our findings reveal a novel role for BAG3 as host protein contributing to HPV18 E6-activated pro-survival strategies, and suggest a possible relevance of its expression levels in drug/radiotherapy-resistance of HPV18-bearing cervical carcinomas.","output":"BAG3 down-modulation sensitizes HPV18(+) HeLa cells to PEITC-induced apoptosis and restores p53"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors base their hypothesis on growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to modulate oncogenic pathways, promote chronic low-grade inflammation and cause tissue damage.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type metal transporters provide a considerable amount of different transition metals for bacterial growth. TroA is a substrate binding protein for uptake of multiple metal ions. However, the function and structure of the TroA homologue from the epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates (SsTroA) have not been characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we determined the crystal structure of SsTroA from a highly pathogenic streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-causing Streptococcus suis in complex with zinc. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that apo-SsTroA binds Zn(2+) and Mn(2+). Both metals bind to SsTroA with nanomolar affinity and stabilize the protein against thermal unfolding. Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) induce distinct conformational changes in SsTroA compared with the apo form as confirmed by both circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. NMR data also revealed that Zn(2+)/Mn(2+) bind to SsTroA in either the same site or an adjacent region. Finally, we found that the folding of the metal-bound protein is more compact than the corresponding apoprotein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings reveal a mechanism for uptake of metal ions in S. suis and this mechanism provides a reasonable explanation as to how SsTroA operates in metal transport.","output":"Insight into the Interaction of Metal Ions with TroA from Streptococcus suis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyzes the factors that explain the increased use of special reports by hospital facility auditors, such as the structured interview, wondering if they look like evaluation studies. It examines their training, impact, and the institutional use implicit in the performance audit. From an anthropological perspective, the audit could traditionally be considered as Rituals of Verification, recognizing the procedure and the evaluation of social effects, in public management. Therefore, sampling represents an effective and efficient tool for carrying out the statutory audit activity in the health care facilities where the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) virus is treated. However, the performance established a regulatory dimension compared to the concept of verification. In addition, auditing practices may often seem trivial, inevitable part of a bureaucratic process, but taken together and over time, they are probably part of a distinct cultural artifact. As we have seen, the reasons that justify the activation of a clinical audit can be numerous: patient complaints, occurrence of adverse events such as the case of COVID-19, performance with inadequate results, publication of new guidelines; however, the bet is that in the future the awareness that auditing is an irreplaceable part of professional practice will mature among professionals.","output":"Comportment Management in the Hospital: Where Is Patients Health Care Station?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a worldwide health problem and no eradicative therapy is currently available. Host T cell immune responses have crucial influences on the outcome of HBV infection, however the development of therapeutic vaccines, T cell therapies and the clinical evaluation of HBV-specific T cell responses are hampered markedly by the lack of validated T cell epitopes. This review presented a map of T cell epitopes functionally validated from HBV antigens during the past 33 years; the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes to present these epitopes, and the methods to screen and identify T cell epitopes. To the best of our knowledge, a total of 205 CD8(+) T cell epitopes and 79 CD4(+) T cell epitopes have been defined from HBV antigens by cellular functional experiments thus far, but most are restricted to several common HLA supertypes, such as HLA-A0201, A2402, B0702, DR04, and DR12 molecules. Therefore, the currently defined T cell epitope repertoire cannot cover the major populations with HLA diversity in an indicated geographic region.

In this paper, several experiments on 19 benchmark datasets are set up to study the efficiency of six powerful oversampling approaches, including both classical and new ones. According to our experimental results, oversampling techniques that consider the minority class distribution (new ones) perform better in most cases and RACOG gives the best performance among the six reviewed approaches. We further validate our conclusion on our real-world inspired vehicle datasets and also find applying oversampling techniques can improve the performance by around 10%. In addition, seven data complexity measures are considered for the initial purpose of investigating the relationship between data complexity measures and the choice of resampling techniques.

While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly used, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and automatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets.

Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed, and the mental health of clinicians has been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence among GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lock down locally. AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","output":"Recovery, restoration, and risk: a cross-sectional survey of the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in the first UK city to lock down"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary, we consider the ambivalent role of ubiquitous computing during the COVID pandemic and we point to the risk that some negative, IT-related practices associated with the pandemic will endure after it.

We therefore point to the prominent role of the IS community in enabling positive aspects of IT use during and after the pandemic, while mitigating negative aspects, especially in the long run. Our sociotechnical background enables us to see these dynamics in a processual and holistic way.

Many of those who eventually died, did so in the critical (intensive) care units of various hospitals around the world, and many secondary cases of SARS arose in healthcare workers looking after such patients in these units. Research on SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) demonstrated that this virus belongs to the same family of viruses, the Coronaviridae that causes the common cold, with some important differences. Properties of this virus have been discovered which can be used to develop important infection control policies within hospitals to limit the number of secondary cases. These properties include environmental survival, transmissibility, viral load in various organs and fluids and periods of symptomatic illness during which infectivity is greatest. Various barrier methods were used throughout the epidemic to protect healthcare workers from SARS, with varying degrees of success. Treatment of SARS patients has mainly involved steroid therapy, with or without ribavirin, but there is no consensus on the best treatment protocol, as yet.

We present the Auckland City Hospital experience of clot retrieval. METHODS Previously independent ischaemic stroke patients with contraindications to, or no response following, i.v. alteplase, were treated with clot retrieval. All patients had proximal large artery occlusions on CT angiography and many also had CT perfusion scans showing salvageable ischaemic tissue. RESULTS Clot retrieval was performed in 33 patients (10 women, mean (SD) age of 54 (17) years) since 2011. Twenty-two (67%) patients were first treated with alteplase. Patients fell into three groups: 17 (52%) had anterior circulation occlusion, similar to those in recent clot retrieval studies; 10 (30%) had posterior circulation occlusion; and six (18%) had 'Rescue' clot retrieval, usually with stroke that followed a procedure. Patients with anterior circulation occlusion had a median time from symptom onset to groin puncture of 225 (range 95-450) minutes, full recanalisation occurred in 76%, and by day 90, all 17 were alive and living at home, with 63% functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2). At day 90, eight of 10 posterior circulation occlusion group patients were alive and living at home, four with a mRS of 0-2. In contrast, four of six 'Rescue' patients had died, and another was functionally dependent with a mRS of 4.

RESULTS Asepsis during phlebotomy, screening for serological and immuno-haematological parameters and appropriate storage conditions are maintained across all countries. Variations in blood component processing exist. Universal leucoreduction is systematically applied in Lebanon. Nucleic acid testing is only performed in Egypt. Aphaeresis procedure, leucoreduction and quality control for blood components are virtually inexistent in Mauritania. Written donor questionnaire is absent in Algeria and Tunisia. Most donor deferral periods for infectious agents are inconsistent with international standards. CONCLUSION Gaps in the processing and in the quality/safety measures applied to the manufacture of blood components are quite evident in most eastern/southern Mediterranean countries.

Minimally invasive laparoscopic resection has been used recently in liver surgery for treating selected hepatic hemangiomas. However, laparoscopic liver surgery poses the significant technical challenges and high rate of conversion. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been proved feasible in the treatment of hepatic hemangiomas with a size range of 5.0-9.9 cm. It is controversial to treat giant hepatic hemangiomas (10.0 cm) by means of RF ablation, due to the low technique success rate and high incidence of ablation-related complications. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined laparoscopic resection with intratumoral RF-induced coagulation for giant hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We treated 2 patients with giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma (12.0 cm and 13.1 cm in diameters respectively) by laparoscopic resection following intratumoral coagulation of the tumor with RF ablation. RESULTS Blood loss during resection was 100 ml (case 1) and 300ml (case 2) respectively. No blood transfusion and dialysis were needed during perioperative period. The two patients were discharged 6 days (case 1) and 12 days (case 2) after surgery without any complications, respectively.

A minority were smokers (9/70; 10%) or had chronic underlying health conditions (16/70; 22.9%), the commonest being asthma. All participants were nasopharyngeal-swab PCR negative, although 4/70 (5.7%) had previously tested positive by NHS testing undertaken during the preceding months. 15/70 (21.4%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Luminex test. Nurses had the highest incidence of positive antibodies (13/45; 28.9%), with a lower incidence in doctors (2/15; 13.3%) although this difference was not statistically significant (Fischer's exact test p=0.3). No receptionists had positive antibody tests. All four participants with a previously reported positive PCR test were antibody-positive. 9/15 (60%) of antibody-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 3.6-fold higher odds than antibody-negative participants, of whom 16/55 reported symptoms (p=0.03). The mean duration of symptoms was 11 days (median 11; range 1-35 days) and the mean time from resolution of reported previous symptoms to antibody testing was 48.4 days (median 46; range 1-123 days). Conclusion: This study establishes the SARS-CoV-2 exposure and carriage rate amongst patient-facing staff working in the oncology department of a large UK general hospital during the pandemic. These results may help inform UK national oncology patient management prior to the development of a viable vaccine or treatment.","output":"First results from the UK COVID-19 Serology in Oncology Staff Study (CSOS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the U.S., Black women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are affected disproportionately by interpersonal violence, which often co-occurs with adverse mental health and/or substance use, and exacerbates existing poor HIV care outcomes.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: University hospital intensive care unit, caring solely for patients with SARS or suspected to have SARS. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five doctors and 152 nurses and healthcare assistants who worked in the ICU during the SARS epidemic. Interventions: Infection control measures designed to prevent transmission of disease to staff were implemented. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with SARS were admitted to the intensive care unit. Four nurses and one healthcare assistant contracted SARS, with three of these developing symptoms within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS. Doctors were exposed to patients with SARS for a median (IQR) of 284 (97C376) h, while nurses and healthcare assistants were exposed for a median (IQR) of 119 (57C166) h. The ICU did not meet international standards for physical space or ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In an ICU in which infection control procedures are rigorously applied, the risk to staff of contracting SARS from patients is low, despite long staff exposure times and a sub-standard physical environment.

Twenty-six hrHPV-positive women were invited to take part in a gynecological follow-up, including a visual assessment of the anogenital region, two-handed gynecological examination, and cervical cytology as well as a colposcopy and cervical biopsy when necessary. Four women declined taking part in the study. Over six years of observation, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) were detected at least once in 7/22 women (31.8%), and a cervical intraepithelial lesion 1 (CIN 1) histopathologic result was obtained five times in 3/22 women. No cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, CIN 2/3, or invasive cervical cancers were observed. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed in three patients. As immunocompromised women are prone to persistent hrHPV infections, they should be under strict gynecological supervision because only vigilant surveillance enables fast detection and treatment of early dysplasia and, therefore, provides a chance for the reduction of the cervical cancer burden.","output":"A Six-Year Gynecological Follow-Up of Immunosuppressed Women with a High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had wide-reaching and unprecedented impacts on the transport sector worldwide.

Individual self-explanations refer to an act of metacognition in which students, after having processed a certain amount of information, attempt to explain their understanding to themselves of what was just learned. Dyadic-explanations refer to the same process, but instead of explaining to oneself, the student explains his/her understanding to another student. METHOD An experiment was conducted in which 120 medical students studied a video-recorded lecture on the role of protein synthesis inhibition on memory reconsolidation. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: (1) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture once; (2) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture twice; (3) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide self-explanations individually; and (4) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide dyadic-explanations. Participants' knowledge regarding the topic was measured three times; at the start and end of the experiment, and one week after the experiment to determine knowledge retention. Data were analysed by means of a 2*2 and 4*3 repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS The results suggest that participants who engaged in individual self- or dyadic-explanations significantly outperformed participants in the two control conditions in terms of learning and retention (F = 5.67, Wilks  = 0.94, P = 0.019, 2 = 0.05). Moreover, the results suggest that dyadic-explanations were more effective than individual self-explanations (F = 3.70, Wilks  = 0.83, P = 0.002, 2 = 0.09).

Materials and methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of pegfilgrastim prophylaxis in DLBCL patients receiving R-CHOP, and we compared them with the PROCESS cohort (n=485). Results: Since January 2015, 986 patients with DLBCL were enrolled. Pegfilgrastim was administered at least once in 930 patients (94.3%), covering 90.3% of all cycles. FN developed in 137 patients (13.9%) in this cohort (23.7% in the PROCESS cohort, p<0.001), and 4.2% of all cycles (10.2% in the PROCESS cohort, p<0.001).

Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand.

Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89). CONCLUSION: Impactful public involvement is feasible in a rapid response setting. Home self-testing with LFIAs can be used with a high degree of acceptability and usability by adults, making them a good option for use in seroprevalence surveys.","output":"Usability and Acceptability of Home-based Self-testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Antibodies for Population Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many real-world problems involve cooperation and/or competition among multiple agents. These problems often can be formulated as multi-agent problems. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant progress on single-agent problems. However, multi-agent problems still cannot be easily solved by traditional RL algorithms. First, the multi-agent environment is considered as a non-stationary system. Second, most multi-agent environments only provide a shared team reward as feedback. As a result, agents may not be able to learn proper cooperative or competitive behaviors by traditional RL. Our algorithm adopts Evolution Strategies (ES) for optimizing policy which is used to control agents and a value decomposition method for estimating proper fitness for each policy. Evolutionary Algorithm is considered as a promising alternative for signal-agent problems. Owing to its simplicity, scalability, and efficiency on zeroth-order optimization, EAs can even outperform RLs on some tasks. In order to solve multi-agent problems by EA, a value decomposition method is used to decompose the team reward. Our method is parallel on multiple cores, which can speed up our algorithm significantly. We test our algorithm on two benchmarking environments, and the experiment results show that our algorithm is better than traditional RL and other representative gradient-free methods.","output":"A Parallel Evolutionary Algorithm with Value Decomposition for Multi-agent Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Evaluation of the technical success rate and complications when retrieving dislocated intravascular foreign bodies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 1999 and 2015 38 patients (21 female; 17 male; Age: 17 - 92; Average 54.3 years) underwent an extraction of intravascular dislocated foreign bodies, which were not lost during a radiological intervention. The extracted material included 29 port catheters, 3 tips of tunneled dialysis catheters, 2 stents, 2 guide wires, 1 CVC tip and 1 AS occluder device. Various catheters for repositioning and extraction were used. The access was transarterial as well as transvenous. Technical success was defined as complete removal of the foreign body. RESULTS The technical success rate was 92.1 % (35 of 38). In 17 patients an additional catheter was necessary to reposition the foreign body in order to make it accessible for the extraction catheter. In one case a stent was relocated and remodeled within the patient and was not extracted. In another case we experienced a dislocation of a small fragment of the port catheter into the distal parts of the pulmonary artery, which couldn't be extracted. A guide wire could not be extracted as it was already adhered with the vessel wall. Peri-interventional complications were not documented. CONCLUSION The percutaneous extraction of dislocated intravascular foreign bodies is technically successful and poor of complications. Interventional therapy can avoid surgical removal. KEY POINTS ?

Individuals with misophonia report significant functional impairment and interpersonal distress. Growing research indicates ineffective coping and emotional functioning broadly (e.g., affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation) are central to the clinical presentation and severity of misophonia. Preliminary evidence suggests an association between negative emotionality and deficits in emotion regulation in misophonia. Still, little is known about (a) the relationships among specific components of emotional functioning (e.g., emotion regulation, affective lability) with misophonia, and (b) which component(s) of misophonia (e.g., noise frequency, emotional and behavioral responses, impairment) are associated with emotional functioning. Further, despite evidence that mood and anxiety disorders co-occur with misophonia, investigation thus far has not controlled for depression and anxiety symptoms. Examination of these relationships will help inform treatment development for misophonia. The present study begins to disambiguate the relationships among affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation, and components of misophonia. A sample of 297 participants completed questionnaires assessing misophonia, emotional functioning, depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact. Findings indicated that misophonia severity was positively associated with each of these constructs with small to medium effect sizes. When controlling for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact, results from this preliminary study suggest that (a) difficulties with emotion regulation may be correlated with misophonia severity, and (b) misophonic responses, not number of triggers or perceived severity, are associated with difficulties with emotion regulation. Overall, these findings begin to suggest that emotion regulation is important to our understanding the risk factors and treatment targets for misophonia.","output":"Examining emotional functioning in misophonia: The role of affective instability and difficulties with emotion regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/ Objectives: According to the reported cases, more than 100 athletes were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in March 2020 alone, and this has created an increased interest in the effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on athletes. This promoted us to study the spread of COVID-19 in athletes and formulate prevention strategies. Methodology: We collected and analyzed the demographic information, such as nationality, sex, age, name, sport played, sport level, source and cause of infection, date of symptoms onset or confirmation of positive status, date of recovery, location of infection contraction, symptoms, and the people infected by the contracted athletes, of 521 infected athletes worldwide, as of the end of July, 2020. Results: The cohort comprised 95.49% male athletes; 57.2% were aged 19C35 years, with the average age 23 years. Most of these cases emerged in March 2020 (27.3%) and June 2020 (30.1%), 90.8% of cases were active athletes and 74.2% were professional players, 45.2% of infected athletes exhibited mild symptoms and 30.6% of them were asymptomatic; however, 23.1% of the cases died, including cases aged less than 40 years. Most infected athletes represented soccer (46.6%), football (15.9%), and basketball (10.9%). Most of the infected athletes were from the United States, Western Europe, and Eastern Asia. The athletes primarily contracted the infection in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. The spread of COVID-19 in these athletes primarily occurred during training- and game-related activities. More than 60% of the infected athletes were unaware of their source of infection. Conclusion: It found that the halting of training and matches, isolation of athletes at home, and timely testing can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 among athletes, and it is recommended that athletes discontinue international travel, especially to countries with a high epidemic risk.","output":"The Spread of COVID-19 in Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Adalimumab is normally prescribed with methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis given the enhanced treatment effect and reduced antidrug antibody (ADA) formation compared to adalimumab monotherapy.

METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of adalimumab combined with MTX (ADL-MTX group) compared to adalimumab monotherapy (ADL group) in chronic plaque psoriasis. RESULTS Thirty-one patients in the ADL-MTX group and 30 in the ADL group were analysed.After one year, a (non-significant) better drug survival was found in the ADL-MTX group (74.2% vs 58.6%; p=0.15). The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)75 response in week 49 was 58.1% vs. 36.7% (p=0.13) and the median (IQR) serum trough concentrations were 6.8 (5.5-9.2) vs. 5.9 (3.5-8.8)mg/L (p=0.26) in the ADL-MTX and ADL group respectively.

By contrast, an exaggerated antiinflammatory response has also been described following cardiac arrest, which may be mediated by downregulation of antigen presentation receptor HLA-DR. We report the composition of monocyte subpopulations and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR following cardiac arrest. Blood specimens were collected from 32 patients at three timepoints in the first 48 h after cardiac arrest. Monocyte subset composition was determined by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR. Monocyte subset composition and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR were correlated with patient outcomes. The results were compared to 19 patients with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest patients showed a significant decline in the percentage of nonclassical monocytes. Monocyte CD14 expression was upregulated after 24 h and correlated with the time to return of spontaneous circulation. Downregulation of HLA-DR expression was observed mainly among classical monocytes and significantly correlated with the dose of norepinephrine used to treat shock. Downregulation of HLA-DR among nonclassical and intermediate monocytes was significantly associated with disease severity. Our data demonstrate the disturbance of monocyte subset composition with a significant decline in nonclassical monocytes at an early stage following cardiac arrest.

The present study aimed to detect the symptoms and reactions of the population with respect to the event. The survey was carried out by describing the clinical symptoms that emerged from the triage card used by SIPEM SoS Emilia Romagna (Italy), connoting the criteria of emergency psychology. METHODS: A retrospective quantitative study was conducted on 288 psychological triage cards. RESULTS: only 11% of users who ask for support say they are positive while 85% report not having contracted the virus.

Clinical and pathology data were collected. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference in FR+CTCs levels in patients with prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and benign disease. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was used to compare the accuracy of FR+CTCs and tPSA in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We found that levels of FR+CTCs were significantly higher in cancer patients (both prostate and bladder cancer) than in patients with benign urinary disease (p < 0.001). Besides, FR+CTCs level was consistently high in the prostate cancer patients with different tPSA levels (p < 0.001), and it was significantly higher in the patients with f/tPSA levels <0.16 than in those patients with f/tPSA levels >0.16 (12.20  1.31 vs. 8.73  0.92 FU/3 ml, p = 0.043).

In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of pangolin-CoV is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one difference in a noncritical amino acid. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the recombination of a virus similar to pangolin-CoV with one similar to RaTG13.

However, there have been various problems associated with the PPE, ranging from its shortage to problems arising from heat, dehydration, etc while wearing them. There is a need to assess these problems faced by HCWs both qualitatively and quantitatively for their timely and effective redressal. Methods An electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among a cohort of HCWs who had performed COVID-19 duties and used PPE kits. The cohort consisted of different categories of doctors, nursing personnel, and other paramedical staff. Results The most common problems associated with using PPE kits was excessive sweating (100%), fogging of goggles, spectacles, or face shields (88%), suffocation (83%), breathlessness (61%), fatigue (75%), headache due to prolonged use (28%), and pressure marks on the skin at one or more areas on repeated use (19%). Occasional problems reported were skin allergy/dermatitis caused by the synthetic material of the PPE kit, face shield impinging onto the neck during intubation, and nasal pain, pain at the root of the pinna, and slipperiness of shoe covers.

Setting programmatic targets, particularly in generalised epidemics, could incorporate estimates of the size of the population likely to be eligible for PrEP using incidence-based thresholds. We estimated the proportion of men and women who would be eligible for PrEP and the number of HIV infections that could be averted in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia using prioritisation based on age, sex, geography, and markers of risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed the latest nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia to determine the proportion of adults who report behavioural markers of risk for HIV infection. We used prevalence ratios (PRs) to quantify the association of these factors with HIV status. Using a multiplier method, we combined these proportions with the number of new HIV infections by district, derived from district-level modelled HIV estimates. Based on these numbers, different scenarios were analysed for the minimum number of person-years on PrEP needed to prevent 1 HIV infection (NNP). An estimated total of 38,000, 108,000, and 46,000 new infections occurred in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia in 2016, corresponding with incidence rates of 0.43, 0.63, and 0.57 per 100 person-years. In these countries, 9%C20% of new infections occurred among people with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 12 months and 40%C42% among people with either an STI or a non-regular sexual partner (NP) in the past 12 months (STINP). The models estimate that around 50% of new infections occurred in districts with incidence rates 1.0% in Mozambique and Zambia and 0.5% in Malawi. In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, 35.1%, 21.9%, and 12.5% of the population live in these high-incidence districts. In the most parsimonious scenario, if women aged 15C34 years and men 20C34 years with an STI in the past 12 months living in high-incidence districts were to take PrEP, it would take a minimum of 65.8 person-years on PrEP to avert 1 HIV infection per year in Malawi, 35.2 in Mozambique, and 16.4 in Zambia. Our findings suggest that 3,300, 5,200, and 1,700 new infections could be averted per year in the 3 countries, respectively. Limitations of our study are that these values are based on modelled estimates of HIV incidence and self-reported behavioural risk factors from national surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of new HIV infections in these 3 African countries were estimated to occur among people who had either an STI or an NP in the past year, providing a straightforward means to set PrEP targets. Greater prioritisation of PrEP by district, sex, age, and behavioural risk factors resulted in lower NNPs thereby increasing PrEP cost-effectiveness, but also diminished the overall impact on reducing new infections","output":"Estimating HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis need and impact in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia: A geospatial and risk-based analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malaria infection starts with the injection of Plasmodium sporozoites into the host's skin.

Although the move toward submuscular (SM) device placement led to a decreased incidence of CC, subcutaneous (SQ) implantation has seen a resurgence. The purpose of this study was to use a rodent model of breast reconstruction with smooth silicone implants and delayed radiotherapy to assess the occurrence of CC in SQ versus SM implantation. METHODS Custom 2 mL smooth round silicone implants were placed bilaterally into 12 female Sprague Dawley rats that were randomized into 4 groups of 3, with each group differing by implantation plane (SQ vs SM) and irradiation status (irradiated vs nonirradiated). Rats from the SQ group received implants bilaterally underlying the skin on the flank. Rats in the SM groups received implants bilaterally under the latissimus dorsi muscle. Irradiated rats received 20 Gy localized to each implant on postoperative day 10. One rat from each group was imaged with a micro-computed tomography scanner at baseline and at explant 3 months later, whereupon capsules from all rats were examined histologically. RESULTS Rats in the SQ group showed evidence of contracture on gross examination and greater evidence of morphologic disruption per micro-computed tomography scan. There was no evidence of contracture or morphologic disruption in either SM group. Mean  SD capsule thickness was 39.0  9.0 m in the SQ versus 37.6  9.8 m in the SM nonirradiated groups and 43.9  14.9 m in the SQ versus 34.3  8.3 m in the SM irradiated groups (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In a rodent model of smooth silicone breast implantation and delayed radiotherapy, although there did not appear to be differences in capsule thickness regardless of device placement plane, SQ implants demonstrated gross evidence of CC. These data indicate that capsule thickness is only part of a larger pathogenetic picture, which should take into consideration the contribution from all peri-implant tissue.","output":"Periprosthetic Capsule Formation and Contracture in a Rodent Model of Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction With Delayed Radiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Follicular CXCR5(+)CD8(+) T cells have antiviral effects in chronic virus infection, but the roles of these cells during dengue virus 2 (DENV2) infection remain poorly understood.

Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010C2016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18C7.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR.

Therefore, this single-center observational study aimed to assess the positivity rate of hospital-wide antigen screening tests for COVID-19 and evaluate clinical factors associated with antigen positivity during a COVID-19 institutional outbreak in Sapporo, Japan. We analyzed the data of 1615 employees who underwent salivary or nasal swab antigen tests on November 18, 2020, to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Laboratory confirmation using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed for those with positive viral serology. The demographic characteristics, job titles, and risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were compared between employees with and without COVID-19. A total of 19 employees (1.2%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The positivity rate was high among rehabilitation therapists (2.1%) and employees in the low-risk contact group (6.1%). Although there was no association between the job titles and the seropositivity rate, those in the low-risk contact group had an increased risk of testing positive for the viral antigen (odds ratio, 8.67; 95% confidence interval, 3.30C22.8).

METHODS From a phage library comprising 10(9) different displayed peptides, 1 peptide was enriched after 5 in vitro selection rounds on HNO223 tumor cells. Subsequently, the gained peptide sequence H(2)N-SPRGDLAVLGHKY-CONH(2) (HBP-1) was synthesized as an amide and labeled with (125)I. In vitro studies for binding kinetics and competition were performed with 5 different HNSCC cell lines. Furthermore, the stability of the peptide was evaluated in human serum. The in vivo biodistribution of (131)I-labeled peptide was determined in HNSCC tumor-bearing nude mice. The results were further validated in human HNSCC tumor tissue sections using fluorescence-labeled HBP-1. Competition experiments were performed to determine the binding sequence and validate the target. RESULTS The HBP-1 motif was enriched in 62% of all phages sequenced. Labeled (125)I-HBP-1 showed binding to 5 different HNSCC cell lines and a maximum binding to HNO97 cells, with 11% of the applied dose per 10(6) cells and an inhibitory concentration of 50% of 38.9 nM. Stability experiments in human serum showed a half-life of 55 min. In 2 different HNSCC tumor xenografts, (131)I-HBP-1 accumulated rapidly, with stable uptake until 45 min after intravenous application. Peptide immunohistochemistry of HNSCC tissue sections exhibited tumor staining by HBP-1, whereas normal tissue remained negative. Sequence mutation and competition experiments revealed that the intrinsic RGD motif in combination with the intrinsic LXXL motif is responsible for the binding ability of HBP1. The RGDLXXL sequence within this peptide is known and indicates that binding occurs via the alpha(v)beta(6) rather than the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin.

This will require policy change across the economic sectors that govern food systems, including agriculture, trade, finance, commerce and industry - a goal that has been beset by political challenges. These sectors have been strongly influenced by entrenched policy agendas and paradigms supported by influential global actors such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). METHODS This study draws on the concept of path dependency to examine how historical economic policy agendas and paradigms have influenced current food and nutrition policy and politics in Ghana. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 relevant policy actors, and documentary data were collected from current policies, academic and grey literature, historical budget statements and World Bank Group Archives (1950-present). RESULTS Despite increased political priority for nutrition in Ghana, its integration into food policy remains limited. Food policy agendas are strongly focused on production, employment and economic returns, and existing market-based incentives do not support a nutrition-sensitive food supply. This policy focus appears to be rooted in a liberal economic approach to food policy arising from structural adjustment in the 1980s and trade liberalization in the 1990s, combined with historical experience of 'failure' of food policy intervention and an entrenched narrowly economic conception of food security. CONCLUSION This study suggests that attention to policy paradigms, in addition to specific points of policy change, will be essential for improving the outcomes of food systems for nutrition.

The self-organizing map (SOM) is a neural network method for the conceptualisation of relationships within complex data, such as genome signatures. The various parameters of the SOM training phase are investigated for their effect on the accuracy of the resulting output map. It is concluded that larger SOMs, as well as taking longer to train, are less sensitive in phylogenetic classification of unknown DNA sequences. However, where a classification can be made, a larger SOM is more accurate. Increasing the number of iterations in the training phase of the SOM only slightly increases accuracy, without improving sensitivity. The optimal length of the DNA sequence k-mer from which the genome signature should be derived is 4 or 5, but shorter values are almost as effective. In general, these results indicate that small, rapidly trained SOMs are generally as good as larger, longer trained ones for the analysis of genome signatures. These results may also be more generally applicable to the use of SOMs for other complex data sets, such as microarray data.","output":"Genome Signatures, Self-Organizing Maps and Higher Order Phylogenies: A Parametric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen: SARS-CoV-2 es un virus de alta estabilidad ambiental.

Internationalisation at most higher education institutions mainly takes the form of study abroad. This immersion in an intercultural environment is believed to foster the development of academic and non-academic skills, thus improving graduates employability. Regardless of the geographical area, higher education institutions (HEI) have therefor put student mobility at the heart of their academic projects. However, the context has changed: the Covid-19 health crisis has led to a freezing of international mobility. Alternative solutions to traditional mobility must be found. With this book, we intend to contribute to reflections on how to develop intercultural sensitivity and intercultural competences among students through Internationalisation at Home. For this purpose, in the eight chapters of the book, we present some pedagogical methods that facilitate the creation of a context conducive to interculturality and the acquisition of plural skills by students at home. Some authors examine how these competences can be assessed. Finally, we propose a framework explaining how a combination of activities within an institution can foster the development of students' intercultural competences. Regardless of the approaches chosen by the teachers observed, they answered similar questions.

Coronavirus has remarkably interrupted the higher education sector which is the main deciding factor for economic future of the country. The novel coronavirus has bashed our education system to the extreme level;we can expect a different kind of educational model to emerge after COVID-19. Higher education institutions (HEIs) such as colleges, universities, and tertiary education institutions were in huge loss due to prevailing situations. According to UNESCO, over 1.5 billion students in 165 countries are in huge loss as they cannot attend school. The Government of India conducted survey according to Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on higher education and observed that there are 993 universities, 39,931 colleges, and 10,725 stand-alone institutions listed on their portal, which contribute to education. This forced global communities to enhance new techniques for learning which also includes both distance and virtual learning. Apparently, it is the first time in India to experiment with education system merging from classrooms with online learning. Educating the students simultaneously about the emotional intelligence to control their fears and anxiety can render their mental stability, and education system will transform in the best way if there is psychological support for students .This work mainly focuses on the changes that need to be incorporated to get over the huge loss for the higher education system due to COVID-19. ? 2021 River Publishers.

However, we do not yet understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychosocial health of people with spinal cord injury (PwSCI), a population that is already at risk of experiencing mental health conditions. Objectives The aims of the study were to (1) examine the impact of the pandemic on the psychosocial health of PwSCI and (2) investigate the experiences of PwSCI and resources they reported needing during the peak of the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional survey with closed- and open-ended questions was administered to 51 PwSCI. Participants were included if they had an SCI, were 18 years or older, lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and surrounding areas, and understood English. Results Canonical correlation showed a significant association between financial security, food insecurity, and personal assistance service use and adverse psychosocial health outcomes (p < .001). Participants reported interest in resources related to COVID-19 precautions for wheelchair users as well as home exercise programming and financial assistance with utilities. Finally, qualitative analysis revealed four major themes: (1) mental health during the pandemic, (2) financial concerns and reduced access to personal assistance services, (3) feelings of social isolation prior to the pandemic, and (4) local and national authorities' handling of the pandemic.

In human studies, these effects are limited to investigating the neural, behavioral and cognitive characteristics of offspring. Only animal studies have investigated the metabolic parameters influenced by passive opium smoke exposure. Here, we conducted population-based analyses aimed to estimate the association of paternal opioid consumption, started before or after child birth, with BMI status and plasma lipid profile of young adult offspring. The present study includes 840 parents-offspring trios (offspring aged 15C35, parents aged 35C70) who participated in the prospective Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS)a city in the south-east of Iranas one of the district areas of the PERSIAN cohort (Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN). All procedures for interviews, anthropometric measurements and physical examinations, biological sample collection and laboratory tests for blood biochemical parameters were conducted according to the PERSIAN cohort protocol, and in the well-established RCS setting. Crude and adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to assess the relationship of paternal regular opioid use with offsprings BMI status, and plasma lipid factors. The prevalence of fathers who use opioids regularly among the studied trios was 42.8% (360/840). Our regression analyses demonstrated that paternal opioid use started pre-fatherhood is associated with 76% higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) of overweight/obesity in young offspring (adjusted OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.15C2.71)), adjusting for sex, age, parental BMIs, paternal smoking status and socioeconomic status index (WSI). This relationship persisted when fathers who used opioid by routes other than inhaling (oral) were excluded from logistic analysis (adjusted OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.12C2.68)). Interestingly, sex stratified analysis displayed a 201% increased odds ratio of overweight/obesity in sons of fathers who use opioid regularly, started after child birth (Adjusted OR 3.01 (95% CI 1.68C5.39), while no significant association was found in daughters (adjusted OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.35C1.54)). Additionally, increasing exposureCresponse relationships were observed between odds ratios of overweight/obesity and the number of years of paternal opioid use after birth (p-trend = 0.0008). Paternal regular opioid use started pre-fatherhood was associated with 54% lowered risk of underweight [adjusted OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.24C0.86)]. Finally, paternal opioid consumption started either before or after child birth did not show a significant association with the high level of the three parameters of plasma lipid factors (triglyceride, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol) in offspring. Our results suggest that the environmental impacts of paternal regular opioid use may be sufficient to make an effect on male offspring metabolism independent of genetic and epigenetic impact on gametes.","output":"Cohort-based analysis of paternal opioid use in relation to offsprings BMI and plasma lipid profile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A computational proteomic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might bind to hemoglobin (Hb).

METHODS: Between May 2011 and July 2014, 33 pediatric patients with pneumonia caused by aspiration of oil-based substances were admitted to the Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical Center, Guangdong, China. Data on the demographics of these patients, as well as that on clinical presentations, imagenological characteristics, history of ingestion, laboratory observations, treatment protocol, response to therapy, BAL findings, and treatment outcomes were collected. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 23 boys (69.7 %) and 10 girls (30.3 %), with ages ranging from 4 mo to 4 y. They were admitted to the hospital 2 h to 13 d after ingesting the oil-based substance. By the time of admission, most patients presented with respiratory distress and other symptoms, including tachypnea (n = 21), cough (n = 25), mild fever (n = 18), progressive dyspnea (n = 12), and pneumorrhagia (n = 5); six patients received mechanical ventilation because of complicated respiratory distress syndrome. The most common laboratory observations were leukocytosis (25 of 33, 75.8 %), neutrophilia (23 of 33, 69.7 %), and anemia (8 of 33, 24.2 %). Serum biochemical examination showed elevated sedimentation rates (24 of 33, 72.7 %), lactate dehydrogenase levels (18 of 33, 54.5 %), and C-reactive protein levels (17 of 33, 51.5 %). The most common finding on computed tomography (CT) scans was areas of consolidation. Within the follow-up duration of 2 wk to 6 mo, all patients with clinical symptoms of ELP experienced remission, and none died. The CT scans of most of the cases were normal by 1 to 3 mo, except for two patients who showed complete improvement 6 mo after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that multiple BALs combined with steroid therapy result in significant improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters in children with acute ELP. Further, some traditional practices may predispose children to ELP, even in the absence of underlying risk factors. Finally, pneumorrhagia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be the main complications of acute ELP in children.","output":"Study of Acute Exogenous Lipoid Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The probable impact of a maintenance immunosuppressant (IS) on liver transplant (LT) recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unexplored. Our specific aim was to approximate the prognosis of LT recipients with COVID-19 on the standard maintenance IS. Method: We searched separate databases for the qualified studies in between December 2019 and June 25, 2021. Ultimately, a meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity. Results: In a total of eight studies and 509 LT recipients with COVID-19, the pooled rates of severity and mortality during all the combined immunosuppressive therapies were 22.4 and 19.5%, respectively. Our study sufficiently showed that an immunosuppressive therapy in LT recipients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with a non-severe COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR): 11.49, 95% CI: 4.17C31.65; p < 0.001] and the survival of the patients (OR: 17.64, 95% CI: 12.85C24.22; p < 0.001). Moreover, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi) typically had the lowest rate of severity and mortality compared to other ISs such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), steroids, and antimetabolites, i.e., severity (13.5 vs. 21.1, 24.7, and 26.3%) and mortality (8.3 vs. 15, 17.2, and 12.1%), respectively. Contrary to the general opinions, our meta-analysis showed comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiopulmonary disorders, chronic kidney disease (CKD), age >60, the duration of LT to the diagnosis of COVID-19, primary disease for LT, and obesity were not significantly associated with the severity and mortality in LT recipients with COVID-19 under an immunosuppressive therapy. However, our pooled analysis found that LT recipients with COVID-19 and without comorbidities have a less severe disease and low mortality rate compared to those with both COVID-19 and comorbidities. Conclusions: In conclusion, LT recipients with COVID-19 undergoing immunosuppressive therapies are not significantly associated with the severity and mortality. Therefore, taking the risk of organ rejection into a key consideration, a complete withdrawal of the IS may not be wise. However, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) might be discontinued or replaced from an immunosuppressive regimen with the CNIs- or mTORis-based immunosuppressive therapy in some selected LT recipients with COVID-19, depending upon the severity of the disease.","output":"Immunosuppressants in Liver Transplant Recipients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Capability or Catastrophe?A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of engagement with communities and individuals to ensure the effectiveness of any COVID-19 testing programme.

As there is a huge need to better comprehend why all of these targeted comments and opinions developed specifically at the start of the outbreak, we sought to carefully examine racism and advocacy efforts on Twitter in the first quarter of 2020 (January 15 to March 3, 2020). OBJECTIVE: The first research question aimed to understand the main type of racism displayed on Twitter during the first quarter of 2020. The second research question focused on evaluating Twitter users positive and negative responses regarding racism toward Chinese individuals. METHODS: Content analysis of tweets was utilized to address the two research questions. Using the NCapture browser link and NVivo software, tweets in English and Spanish were pulled from the Twitter data stream from January 15 to March 3, 2020. A total of 19,150 tweets were captured using the advanced Twitter search engine with the keywords and hashtags #nosoyunvirus, #imNotAVirus, #ChineseDontComeToJapan, #racism, No soy un virus, and Racismo Coronavirus. After cleaning the data, a total of 402 tweets were codified and analyzed. RESULTS: The data confirmed clear sentiments of racism against Chinese individuals during the first quarter of 2020. The tweets displayed individual, cultural, and institutional racism. Individual racism was the most commonly reported form of racism, specifically displaying physical and verbal aggression. As a form of resistance, Twitter users created spaces for advocacy and activism. The hashtag I am not a virus helped to break stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination on Twitter. CONCLUSIONS: Advocacy efforts were enormous both inside and outside the Chinese community; an allyship sentiment was fostered by some white users, and an identification with the oppression experienced by the Chinese population was expressed in the Black and Muslim worldwide communities.

Moreover, the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants is another issue, specifically regarding the discharge of the virus into environmental settings and the water cycle. The current study monitored SARS-CoV-2 in influent and effluent wastewater samples with three different concentration methods and sludge samples over six months (July to December 2020) to compare different virus concentration methods, assess the fate of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater treatment plants, and describe the potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in influent and infection dynamics. Skimmed milk flocculation (SMF) resulted in higher recoveries of an internal positive control, Armored RNA, and higher positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 in samples compared to ultrafiltration methods employing a prefiltration step to eliminate solids. Our results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may predominate in solids and therefore, concentration methods focusing on both supernatant and solid fractions may result in better recovery. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in influent and primary sludge samples but not in secondary and final effluent samples, indicating a significant reduction during primary and secondary treatments. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in influent on September 30th, 2020. A decay-rate formula was applied to estimate initial concentrations of late-processed samples with SMF. A model based on shedding rate and new cases was applied to estimate SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and the number of active shedders.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV often have unusual sequences with long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region loops, high somatic mutation rates and polyreactivity. A subset of HIV-infected individuals develops such antibodies, but it is unclear whether this reflects systematic differences in their antibody repertoires or is a consequence of rare stochastic events involving individual clones. We sequenced antibody heavy-chain repertoires in a large cohort of HIV-infected individuals with bNAb responses or no neutralization breadth and uninfected controls, identifying consistent features of bNAb repertoires, encompassing thousands of B cell clones per individual, with correlated T cell phenotypes. These repertoire features were not observed during chronic cytomegalovirus infection in an independent cohort. Our data indicate that the development of numerous B cell lineages with antibody features associated with autoreactivity may be a key aspect in the development of HIV neutralizing antibody breadth.","output":"Aberrant B cell repertoire selection associated with HIV neutralizing antibody breadth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Half of mental health disorders begin before the age of 14, highlighting the importance of prevention and early-intervention in childhood. Schools have been identified globally by policymakers as a platform to support good child mental health; however, the majority of the research is focused on secondary schools, with primary schools receiving very little attention by comparison. The limited available evidence on mental health initiatives in primary schools is hindered by a lack of rigorous evaluation. This quasi-experimental cluster study aims to examine the implementation and effectiveness of a Mental Health and Wellbeing Co-ordinator role designed to build mental health capacity within primary schools. METHODS: This is a primary (ages 5C12) school-based cluster quasi-experimental study in Victoria, Australia. Before baseline data collection, 16 schools selected by the state education department will be allocated to intervention, and another 16 matched schools will continue as Business as Usual. In intervention schools, a mental health and well-being coordinator will be recruited and trained, and three additional school staff will also be selected to receive components of the mental health training. Surveys will be completed by consenting staff (at 2-, 5-, 10- and 17-months post allocation) and by consenting parents/carers (at 3-, 10- and 17-months post allocation) in both intervention and business as usual schools. The primary objective is to assess the change in teachers confidence to support student mental health and wellbeing using the School Mental Health Self-Efficacy Teacher Survey. Secondary objectives are to assess the indirect impact on systemic factors (level of support, prioritisation of child mental health), parent and teachers mental health literacy (stigma, knowledge), care access (school engagement with community-based services), and student mental health outcomes. Implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity) and costs will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: The current study will examine the implementation and effectiveness of having a trained Mental Health and Wellbeing Coordinator within primary schools. If the intervention increases teachers confidence to support student mental health and wellbeing and builds the capacity of primary schools it will improve student mental health provision and inform large-scale mental health service reform. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was retrospectively registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) on July 6, 2021. The registration number is ACTRN12621000873820.","output":"Mental health and wellbeing coordinators in primary schools to support student mental health: protocol for a quasi-experimental cluster study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of telemedicine in ICUs has grown and is becoming increasingly recognized. However, its impact on PICUs remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether telemedicine in the PICU has the potential to improve clinical and non-clinical outcomes. PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched to identify studies that assessed the impact of telemedicine on clinical outcomes, with no publication date restrictions. The reference lists of the selected articles were hand-searched for additional studies that had not been identified by the initial electronic search. Studies were included if they had a cohort design, used telemedicine, were conducted in PICUs or specialized PICUs, and were published in Portuguese, English, or Spanish. Two groups of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. The same group of reviewers independently assessed the full-text articles for eligibility and extracted the following information: telecommunication method, intervention characteristics, patient characteristics, sample size, and main results. Studies were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of PICU mortality and length of PICU stay. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Of 2703 studies initially identified, 2226 had their titles and abstracts screened. Of these, 53 were selected for full-text reading, of which 10 were included and analyzed. The main results of interest were length of PICU stay, number of deaths or mortality rate, and satisfaction of health professionals and family members. The results of meta-analysis show that the mortality rate reduced by 34% with an increase of the length of PICU stay in the PICUs with the use of telemedicine. Family members and health professionals were satisfied with the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine has the potential to improve PICU outcomes, such as mortality rate and family and staff satisfaction.

The antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Candida albicans was determined by estimating the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). To assess the biocompatibility of chitosan/-Ag(2)WO(4) composites in a range involving MIC and MBC/MFC on keratinocytes cells (NOK-si), an alamarBlue? assay and an MTT assay were carried out. The SARS-CoV-2 virucidal effects was analyzed in Vero E6 cells through viral titer quantified in cell culture supernatant by PFU/mL assay. Our results showed a very similar antimicrobial activity of chitosan/-Ag(2)WO(4) 3.3 and 6.6, with the last one demonstrating a slightly better action against MSSA. The chitosan/-Ag(2)WO(4) 9.9 showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity (0.49C31.25 g/mL). The cytotoxicity outcomes by alamarBlue? revealed that the concentrations of interest (MIC and MBC/MFC) were considered non-cytotoxic to all composites after 72 h of exposure. The Chitosan/-Ag(2)WO(4) (CS6.6/-Ag(2)WO(4)) composite reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral titer quantification up to 80% of the controls.

While the airborne SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the lungs, viremia is not uncommon. As placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, they are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the human fetus is largely spared from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested whether the human placenta expresses the main SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin and showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the trophoblast rather than in other placental villous cells. While furin is expressed in the main placental villous cell types, we surveyed, trophoblasts exhibit the highest expression. In line with the expression of these entry factors, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could enter primary human trophoblasts. Mechanisms underlying placental defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection likely involve postentry processing, which may be germane for mitigating interventions against SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE Pregnant women worldwide have been affected by COVID-19. As the virus is commonly spread to various organs via the bloodstream and because human placental trophoblasts are directly bathed in maternal blood, feto-placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 seems likely. However, despite the heightened risk to pregnant women, thus far the transmission risk of COVID-19 to the feto-placental unit seems extremely low. This has been recently attributed to a negligible expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the human placenta. We therefore sought to explore the expression of the entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the different cell types of human placental villi. Using a combination of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence, we found that trophoblasts, but not the other main villous cell types, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with a broad expression of furin.

It also has caused a global economic recession. COVID-19 is easily transmitted and causes death. Consequently, severe prevention and control measures of COVID 19 are required in this situation. This study aims to analyze the relationship between anxiety, stigma, religiosity, economic conditions, and the prevention of COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was designed. The data collection was taken through online surveys. The population in this study is ninety-two lecturers from the College of Health Sciences and the State Islamic Institute who were chosen using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. Data analysis used logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that there was a relationship between anxiety (p = 0.001), stigma (p = 0.008), religiosity (p = 0.005) and the efforts to prevent COVID-19, while economic conditions (p = 0.882) were not related to the preventive efforts. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that the most influential variable affecting COVID-19 preventions was the level of anxiety, with an Odds Ratio of 4.9. CONCLUSIONS: There was a relationship between anxiety, stigma, religiosity, and COVID-19 preventions, while there was no relationship between economic conditions and COVID-19 preventions. The most influencing variable was anxiety.

As of October 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database contained >2 million viral genome sequences and a reference set of ~4000 viral genome sequences that cover a wide range of known viral families. Whole-genome sequences can be used to improve viral classification and provide insight into the viral tree of life. However, due to the lack of evolutionary conservation amongst diverse viruses, it is not feasible to build a viral tree of life using traditional phylogenetic methods based on conserved proteins. In this study, we used an alignment-free method that uses k-mers as genomic features for a large-scale comparison of complete viral genomes available in RefSeq. To determine the optimal feature length, k (an essential step in constructing a meaningful dendrogram), we designed a comprehensive strategy that combines three approaches: (1) cumulative relative entropy, (2) average number of common features among genomes, and (3) the Shannon diversity index. This strategy was used to determine k for all 3,905 complete viral genomes in RefSeq.

METHODS: The medical records of 56 patients who received ECMO support treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University from January 2013 to December 2019 were selected. The nosocomial infection, pathogen distribution and drug resistance, and the influencing factors of nosocomial infection were analyzed. The predictive value of independent risk factors for nosocomial infection after ECMO was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients receiving ECMO treatment were included. The nosocomial infection rate was 28.57%, and the prevalence infection rate was 44.64%. Lower respiratory tract infection was the main infection site. Among these infectious patients, 53 strains of pathogens were detected. The results showed that the gram-negative bacteria were mainly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia. Moreover, the drug resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to most of the antibiotics was more than 65%, among which the drug resistance rate to carbapenems was 80%. The results of risk factors of nosocomial infection after ECMO were analyzed by univariate analysis, showing that ECMO treatment time, hospitalization time, antibacterial drug use time, ventilator use time, catheter intubation time and central venous intubation time were statistically significant (all p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified that ECMO treatment time was an independent risk factor. As showed by ROC curve, ECMO treatment time had a high predictive value for postoperative nosocomial infection. ECMO treatment times of more than 4.5 days were associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infection.

The current study was set to investigate the therapeutic potential of MR on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and its underlying mechanisms. We found that MR attenuated LPS-induced pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and alveolar epithelial cell injuries in mice. MR upregulated cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) expression and enhanced the production of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S). MR also inhibited the activation of Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4)/NF-B/NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), then reduced IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- release and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, the protective effects of MR on LPS-induced ALI were abrogated by inhibiting CSE, whereas exogenous H(2)S treatment alone mimicked the protective effects of MR in Cse(?/?) mice after LPS administration.

This decrease has been caused by a combination of demand and supply shocks. Main reasons for these shocks were the global travel restrictions, border closures, the rules and regulations for physical distancing as well as income losses of both private companies and private households even though financial support has been provided by many governments. As a consequence, airlines worldwide had to cut down the number of operated routes and flights significantly. Since February 2020, both the number of global passengers and passenger flight kilometers decreased by 80 per cent and more). These developments have caused large financial losses both for airlines and airports worldwide, critically threatening the existence of a large number of these companies. This paper investigates whether and how the economic recovery of the aviation sector should be supported by governments. Our main results indicate that government loans or government secured loans are enabling a well-balanced trade-off between governmental influence, public debt and distortion of competition if the lending criteria are transparent and nondiscriminatory. However, in the course of time, over-indebtedness will become a critical issue for most companies.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at two tertiary care facilities: Sancaktepe Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, and St. George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Included were people testing RT\\\\PCR positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 during pregnancy, between April 01, 2020 and February 14, 2022, and divided into three epochs: (i) pre\\\\Delta, 1 Apr 2020 to 8 Jun 2021 in Turkey, and 1 Apr 2020 to 31 Jul 2021 in the UK; (ii) Delta, 9 Jun 2021 to 27 Dec 2021 in Turkey, and 1 Aug 2021 to 27 Dec 2021 in the UK; and (iii) Omicron, after 27 Dec 2021 in each of Turkey and the UK, according to the date of their positive RT\\\\PCR test. Baseline data collected included maternal age, parity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, gestational age at diagnosis, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was the need for oxygen supplementation, classified as oxygen support via nasal cannula or breather mask, non\\\\invasive mechanical ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high\\\\flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation with intubation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Inferences were made after balancing of confounders, using an evolutionary search algorithm. RESULTS: 1285 RT\\\\PCR\\\\proven SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infections of unvaccinated pregnant women were identified during the pre\\\\Delta (N=870), Delta (N=339), and Omicron (N=77) epochs. In the confounder\\\\balanced cohort, infection during the Delta wave was associated with increased need for nasal oxygen support (RR 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75\\\\3.65, P<.001), CPAP or high\\\\flow oxygen (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.37\\\\4.56, P=.002), mechanical ventilation (RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.60\\\\11.0, P=.003), and ECMO (RR 11.0, 95% CI 1.43\\\\84.7, P=.021). The maternal mortality rate was also 3\\\\4 fold higher during the Delta wave compared to pre\\\\Delta (5.3% vs 1.5%, P=0.010). An infection during the Omicron wave was not associated with an increased need for nasal oxygen support (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.25\\\\1.55, P=0.251), CPAP or high\\\\flow oxygen (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.36\\\\3.12, P=0.906), or mechanical ventilation (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.06\\\\3.45, P=0.438). The maternal mortality rate was similar during the Omicron wave and the pre\\\\Delta period (1.3% vs 1.3%, P=0.999). Nasal oxygen support during the Omicron wave was significantly lower compared to Delta\\\\wave infection (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11\\\\0.64, P=0.003). Perinatal outcomes were available for a subset of the confounder\\\\balanced cohort. Preterm birth below 34 weeks gestation was significantly increased (P<0.001) during the Delta wave compared with pre\\\\Delta. CONCLUSIONS: Among unvaccinated pregnant women, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection during (vs. before) the Delta wave was associated with increased requirement for oxygen support (including ECMO) and higher maternal mortality. Disease severity and pregnancy complications were similar during the Omicron wave (vs. pre\\\\Delta). SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection in unvaccinated pregnant women carries considerable risks of morbidity and mortality, and COVID\\\\19 vaccination remains key. Miscommunication of risks of Omicron infection may adversely impact the vaccination rate among pregnant women, who are already at increased risk of complications related to COVID\\\\19.

The COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, public health measures, as well as civic and political unrest over racial tensions during an election year could plausibly impact injury care. We hypothesized that increased injuries related to high-risk activities during 2020 was temporally related to sociopolitical unrest and pandemic public health measures. METHODS: Retrospective data from two Level 1 urban, adult trauma centers in different US states (City A population:1.6M, City B:0.21M) were assessed (1/1/2020- 12/31/2020). Calendar months were divided into quartiles and compared to analogous quartiles in years 2016 -2019. Variables studied (demographics, injury mechanisms and outcomes) were compared between years, and across 2020 quartiles, against a backdrop of key sociopolitical events. RESULTS: More patients presented for injury in 2020 (A: n=1057, B: n= 1053) than in prior years (p< 0.05). Compared to 2016-2019, 2020, patients were more often black (A:63.1% vs. 69.8% p< 0.001;B:31.0% vs. 34.3%, p=0.02). Institution A patients were more likely to be male (p=0.002) & younger (p< 0.001) in 2020 vs. 2016-2019. Both institutions noted a steep rise in gunshot wound (GSW) and motor vehicle collision (MVC) injuries following state lockdowns (Fig A, B) with a persistent rise in GSWs until late fall (Fig C). CONCLUSIONS: 2020 was a unique year of sociopolitical unrest interwoven with a pandemic. Most affected populations were young, black males in two different urban centers and primarily involved GSWs and MVCs. Future disaster response planning should consider the drivers of these trends to mitigate their impact, especially in vulnerable populations.","output":"A uniquely violent year: The impact of social and political events on 2020 urban injury patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Leon Fredericq Foundation gives support to the clinicians and the scientists of the Uliege and of the CHU of Liege in order to push back the frontiers of biomedical science and to contribute to improve the care and cure of patients.

Bathing is one of the important routine cares for neonates, but it makes a big environmental change for them. We aimed to examine whether water temperature, room temperature, and position changes in tub bathing serve as noxious stimuli to neonates. METHODS: This prospective trial was performed in full-term and non-low-birth-weight neonates admitted to the hospital between July 2020 and March 2021. Those with underlying diseases, fetal distress, infection, and other medical conditions were excluded. Measurements were taken during the neonates first tub bath since birth, which was performed by a trained nurse. Changes in regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)), determined using near-infrared spectroscopy, and water and room temperature, were examined at five different time points: upon entering the bath, head washing, position change, exiting the bath, and during the 3 min after bathing. RESULTS: In total, 17 neonates were analyzed. No changes in rSO(2) due to head washing or position change were observed; however, rSO(2) significantly decreased upon entering (78.5  4.1% vs. 75.7  4.1%, p < 0.001) and exiting the bath (75.8  5.7% vs. 74.4  5.4%, p < 0.04). The rate change in rSO(2) upon entering the bath showed a significant inverse correlation with water temperature (r = ? 0.53, p < 0.03), and there were no significant correlations between rSO(2) and water or room temperature upon exiting the bath. There was no change in body skin temperature before and after bathing, but rSO(2) gradually decreased during the 3 min after bathing. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates may perceive certain temperatures during bathing as noxious stimuli. Therefore, methods to minimize stress associated with bathing should be implemented to reduce the difference between water temperature and room temperature during bathing.

METHODS: We retrospectively revised data about all COVID-19 patients hospitalized at a University Hospital in Northern Italy, between March 1 and April 29, 2020. Several polynomial models (from first to fourth order) were fitted to estimate the relationship between the time and the number of occupied hospital beds during the entire period and after the local peak of the outbreak and to provide the prediction of short-term hospital beds demand. Model selection was based on the adjusted R-2 (aR(2)) Index and likelihood ratio test (LRT). RESULTS: We included 836 hospitalizations (800 COVID-19 patients). The median length of hospital in-stay was 12 days. According to the aR(2), the fourth order models best fitted the data considering the entire time period. When only the data after the peak was selected, no statistical improvement was found adding terms of order 3 and 4 and lower order polynomial models were considered for the forecasting of the hospital beds demand. Both approaches had a decreasing trend in the number of occupied beds along with time;however, the quadratic one showed a faster reduction in the predicted number of beds required by patients affected by COVID-19.

The results of the base model suggested that the economy is fiscally sustainable, and that the primary surplus remains unaffected by increasing levels of public debt. In contrast, the threshold regression model indicated that the increasing level of debt has eroded primary surplus below the threshold level of 30.89% of public debt to GDP. These results need further investigation. Therefore, we modified our basic threshold model to capture budget deficit and surplus as a threshold in response to changes in public debt.

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain parenchyma in quite a few patients, which provide undeniable evidence for the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus. In contrast with the cerebrum and cerebellum, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the olfactory system and the brainstem, both of which also showed severe microgliosis and lymphocytic infiltrations. As compared with the number of patients who underwent viral testing in the central nervous system (CNS), the number of patients showing positive results seems very small. However, it seems too early to conclude that the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is rare in COVID-19 patients because the detection methods or sampling procedures in some studies may not be suitable or sufficient to reveal the CNS infection induced by neurotropic viruses. Moreover, the primary symptoms and/or causes of death were distinctly different among examined patients, which probably caused more conspicuous pathological changes than those due to the direct infection that usually localized to specific brain areas. Unfortunately, most autopsy studies did not provide sufficient details about neurological symptoms or suspected diagnoses of the examined patients, and the documentation of neuropathological changes was often incomplete.

Methods: Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 middle- and low-income U.S. adults, the authors examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults and the associations among planned EIP-financed expenses, challenges with paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the sample, 78.8% reported that they received the EIP, and 82.3% of EIP recipients reported that it had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (odds ratio [OR]52.59), being married (OR51.82), having a history of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (OR51.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR51.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR50.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses with the EIP were savings, paying debt, and rent and accounted for 63.4% of the total amount. Screening positive for mental health or drug use problems was positively associated with greater planned expenses for substances and gambling. EIP receipt also was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying past-month daily expenses. Conclusions: Unconditional cash transfers such as the EIP may be important for sustaining the living situation of middle- and low-income populations. The management of funds is important to consider, especially among adults experiencing mental health and substance abuse problems, and such cash transfers may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.

We assessed whether intensive family-based lifestyle intervention leads to significant weight loss, improved glycaemia and blood pressure in adults at elevated risk for T2D. METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial (iHealth-T2D) was conducted at 120 locations across India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the UK. We included 3684 South Asian men and women, aged 40-70 years, without T2D but with raised haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and/or waist circumference. Participants were randomly allocated either to the family-based lifestyle intervention or control group by location clusters. Participants in the intervention received 9 visits and 13 telephone contacts by community health workers over 1-year period, and the control group received usual care. Reductions in weight (aim >7% reduction), waist circumference (aim 5 cm reduction), blood pressure and HbA1C at 12 months of follow-up were assessed. Our linear mixed-effects regression analysis was based on intention-to-treat principle and adjusted for age, sex and baseline values. RESULTS: There were 1846 participants in the control and 1838 in the intervention group. Between baseline and 12 months, mean weight of participants in the intervention group reduced by 1.8 kg compared with 0.4 kg in the control group (adjusted mean difference -1.10 kg (95% CI -1.70 to -1.06), p<0.001). The adjusted mean difference for waist circumference was -1.9 cm (95% CI -2.5; to 1.3), p<0.001). No overall difference was observed for blood pressure or HbA1c. People who attended multiple intervention sessions had a dose-dependent effect on waist circumference, blood pressure and HbA1c, but not on weight. CONCLUSION: An intensive family-based lifestyle intervention adopting low-resource strategies led to effective reduction in weight and waist circumference at 12 months, which has potential long-term benefits for preventing T2D. A higher number of attended sessions increased the effect on waist circumference, blood pressure and HbA1c.

Results: The emergency physicians probability assessment yielded higher sensitivity (0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.71, Table 1) than the NTS (0.46, 95% CI 0.37-0.56), and had higher specificity (0.76, 95% CI 0.72-0.80) than the NTS (0.71, 95% CI 0.66-0.75) and the emergency clinician ROS (0.62, 95% CI 0.58-0.67). Categorization as moderate or high probability on the emergency physicians probability assessment was also associated with the highest odds of having COVID-19 in regression analyses (adjusted odds ratio=4.61, 95% CI 3.01-7.06). Moderate agreement (kappa 0.41-0.60) was observed between the NTS and ED clinician ROS for fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea;fair agreement (kappa 0.21-0.40) for sore throat, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting;and poor agreement (kappa 0.00-0.20) for myalgias and chills. The 323 patients who had a response recorded for every symptom were included in the PCA. Only Factor 1 (fever, chills, fatigue, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and cough) was associated with increased odds of testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: While the emergency physicians probability assessment had higher sensitivity and specificity than the other two tools, none of the tools evaluated in this study was sufficiently accurate enough to replace a COVID-19 PCR test on a patient entering a clinical setting where transmission control is crucial. These findings suggest that hospitals not rely on symptom or probability assessment in determining infection status but continue to utilize widespread testing. We recommend that providers in other countries experiencing COVID-19 surges consider the relevance of these findings and that as the pandemic develops (with the potential for continued new variant strains), diagnostic testing efforts should supersede the use of clinical screening tools.

This study aimed to understand how mortality by age of hospitalized patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 has changed over time. Objective: To evaluate trends in in-hospital mortality among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included patients who were hospitalized for at least 1 day at 1 of 209 US acute care hospitals of variable size, in urban and rural areas, between March 1 and November 21, 2020. Eligible patients had a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen test within 7 days of admission or during hospitalization, and a record of discharge or in-hospital death. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test within 7 days before admission or during hospitalization. Mortality was extracted from electronically available data. Results: Among 503a?409 admitted patients, 42a?604 (8.5%) had SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. Of those with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, 21a?592 (50.7%) were male patients. Hospital admissions among patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests were highest in the group aged 65 years or older (19a?929 [46.8%]), followed by those aged 50 to 64 years (11a?602 [27.2%]) and 18 to 49 years (10a?619 [24.9%]). Hospital admissions among patients 18 to 49 years of age increased from 1099 of 5319 (20.7%) in April to 1266 of 4184 (30.3%) in June and 2156 of 7280 (29.6%) in July, briefly exceeding those in the group 50 to 64 years of age (June: 1194 of 4184 [28.5%]; 2039 of 7280 [28.0%]). Patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests had higher in-hospital mortality than patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests (4705 [11.0%] vs 11a?707 of 460a?805 [2.5%]; P < .001). In-hospital mortality rates increased with increasing age for both patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests and SARS-CoV-2-positive tests. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests, mortality increased from 45 of 11a?255 (0.4%) in those younger than 18 years to 4812 of 107a?394 (4.5%) in those older than 75 years. In patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests, mortality increased from 1 of 454 (0.2%) of those younger than 18 years to 2149 of 10a?287 (20.9%) in those older than 75 years. In-hospital mortality rates among patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative tests were similar for male and female patients (6273 of 209a?086 [3.0%] vs 5538 of 251a?719 [2.2%]) but higher mortality was observed among male patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2700 of 21a?592 [12.5%]) compared with female patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests (2016 of 21a?012 [9.60%]). Overall, in-hospital mortality increased from March to April (63 of 597 [10.6%] to 1047 of 5319 [19.7%]), then decreased significantly to November (499 of 5350 [9.3%]; P = .04), with significant decreases in the oldest age groups (50-64 years: 197 of 1542 [12.8%] to 73 of 1341 [5.4%]; P = .02; 65-75 years: 269 of 1182 [22.8%] to 137 of 1332 [10.3%]; P = .006; >75 years: 535 of 1479 [36.2%] to 262 of 1505 [17.4%]; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: This nationally representative study supported the findings of smaller, regional studies and found that in-hospital mortality declined across all age groups during the period evaluated. Reductions were unlikely because of a higher proportion of younger patients with lower in-hospital mortality in the later period.","output":"Mortality Among US Patients Hospitalized With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Over the last several years, homelessness has increased in Ireland and across Europe. Rates have recently declined since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but it is unclear whether emergency housing measures will remain in place permanently. Populations experiencing long-term homelessness face a higher burden of multi-morbidity at an earlier age than housed populations and have poorer health outcomes. However, this population also has more difficulty accessing appropriate health services. A realist review by the authors found that important health system contexts which impact access are resourcing, training, funding cycles, health system fragmentation, health system goals, how care is organised, culture, leadership and flexibility of care delivery. Using a realist evaluation approach, this research will explore and refine key system-level factors, highlighted in our realist review, in a local health care system. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand how funding procedures and health system performance management impact service settings, staff, providers and their ability to make services accessible to populations experiencing homelessness. Methods: A realist evaluation will be undertaken to explain how funding and health system performance management impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. Data will be collected using qualitative and realist interview techniques and focus group methodology. Secondary data such as policy documents and budgets will utilised. The analysis will follow Pawson and Tilley's iterative phases starting with building an Initial programme theory, then data collection, data analysis, synthesis and finally building a refined programme theory. Conclusion: Building on a realist review conducted by the same research team, this study will further test and refine findings that explain how health system factors impact healthcare accessibility for populations experiencing homelessness. The study has the potential to inform policy makers, health planners and managers of contextual factors that can be modified to increase healthcare accessibility.","output":"How accessible is healthcare for single adults experiencing long-term homelessness and complex needs?

COVID-19 is a large-scale infectious disease that broke out in 2019, and 212 countries have now been infected with this infectious disease. Some studies have shown that COVID-19 combined with diabetes is an independent risk factor for death or other adverse outcomes. There is currently no specific and effective drug treatment. More and more people have realized that the low-cost CQ and its derivative HCQ have antiviral and anti-inflammatory capabilities and may play a huge role in the fight against COVID-19. At the same time, HCQ can be used as an oral hypoglycemic agent and has the effect of lowering blood glucose. However, there is no evidence-based medicine to confirm the effectiveness and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing clinical evidences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Chinese literature comes from CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM databases. English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE. We will retrieve each database from December 2019 to August 2020. At the same time, we will look for clinical trial registration and gray literature. This study only included clinical randomized controlled trials. The reviewers independently conduct literature selection, data analysis, quality analysis, and evaluation. The primary outcomes include Sputum virus nucleic acid negative time, lung imaging improvement time, mortality rate, mechanical ventilation rate, ICU hospitalization time, hospitalization time, clinical improvement, symptoms Improvement, fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, adverse reactions, etc. Finally, we will conducted a meta-analysis through Review Manager Software version 5.3. RESULTS: The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at a relevant conference. CONCLUSION: This study will explore the effectiveness and safety of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with diabetes.

Susceptibility of subjects with low magnesium status to develop and enhance this infection is possible. There is little data on the magnesium status of patients with Covid-19 with different degrees of severity. This study was conducted to evaluate prevalence of dysmagnesemia in a prospective Covid-19 cohort study according to the severity of the clinical manifestations and to identify factors associated. Serum magnesium was measured in 300 of 549 patients admitted to the hospital due to severe Covid-19. According to the WHO guidelines, patients were classified as moderate, severe, or critical. 48% patients had a magnesemia below 0.75 mmol/L (defined as magnesium deficiency) including 13% with a marked hypomagnesemia (<0.65 mmol/L). 9.6% had values equal to or higher than 0.95 mmol/L. Serum magnesium concentrations were significantly lower in female than in male (0.73  0.12 vs 0.80  0.13 mmol/L), whereas the sex ratio M/F was higher in severe and critical form (p<0.001). In a bivariate analysis, the risk of magnesium deficiency was significantly and negatively associated with infection severity (p<0.001), sex ratio (M/F, p<0.001), oxygenotherapy (p<0.001), stay in critical care unit (p=0.028), and positively with nephropathy (p=0.026).

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the association between the elevated CK and severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase up until January 26, 2020. The main outcome was poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There are 2471 patients from 14 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The incidence of elevated CK in this pooled analysis was 17% (11%, 22%) and the incidence of poor outcome in this pooled analysis was 27% (19%, 34%). Elevated CK was associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 (OR 3.01 [2.21, 4.10], p < 0.001; I2: 10.2%). The effect estimate did not vary with age (p = 0.610), male (p = 0.449), hypertension (p = 0.490), and diabetes (p = 0.457). Elevated CK has a sensitivity of 0.24 (0.17, 0.32), specificity of 0.91 (0.86, 0.94), PLR of 2.6 (1.9, 3.7), NLR of 0.84 (0.78, 0.90), DOR of 3 (2, 5), and AUC of 0.62 (0.57, 0.66) for predicting poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. In this pooled analysis, elevated CK confers to a 49% probability for poor outcome and a non-elevated CK confers to a 24% probability.

The initial presentation of the disease in symptomatic patients is invariably respiratory, with dry cough being the main symptom, but an increasing number of reports reveal multiple organ involvement. The aim of this review is to summarise the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system activated phagocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Data for this review were identified by searches of PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms SARS, COVID-19, renin-angiotensin-system, phagocyte, reactive free radical, antioxidant, ARDS, thrombosis, myocardial, ischaemia, reperfusion, microvascular, and ACE2. Abstracts and reports from meetings were not included in this work. Only articles published in English between 1976 and 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: The cellular target of SARS viruses is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a critical regulating protein in the renin-angiotensin system. The elimination of this enzyme by the viral spike protein results in excessive activation of phagocytes, migration into the tissues via the high endothelial venules, and an oxidative burst. In the case of an over-stimulated host immune response, not only devastating respiratory symptoms, but even systemic or multiorgan involvement may be observed. CONCLUSION: Early-stage medical interventions may assist in returning the exaggerated immune response to a normal range; however, some therapeutic delay might result in excessive tissue damages, occasionally mimicking a systemic disease with a detrimental outcome.","output":"The role of renin-angiotensin system activated phagocytes in the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global health crisis is unprecedented in modern times.

Estrogen's immunoregulatory properties play a significant role in the bi-directional neuroendocrine-immune activity in females. As a result, sex hormones can play a role in men's high mortality rate from coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). It is aimed to clarify the role of 17-estradiol (E2) in the battle against COVID-19. Materials and methods: Until April 2021, a study on PubMed was performed. COVID-19, 17-estradiol (E2), immunoregulatory properties, pregnancy, menopausal symptoms, hormonal therapy, ER/ expression on immune cells, and mortality were some of the concepts used in the search. Results: Regulation of pro-inflammatory immune processes against COVID-19 appears to be associated with increased immune function (pro-inflammatory), anti-inflammatory regulation, and antiviral defense. Women with a severe coronavirus infection had higher serum IgG antibody levels than men, and their IgG production was faster in the early stages of infection. 17-estradiol (E2) levels of blood will increase by 100-fold during pregnancy. COVID-19 in pregnant women had a 15-fold lower mortality rate than other women. While menopause replacement therapy (MRT) for pre/post-menopausal women and its effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 infection is debatable.

As a result, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions are high and in certain settings likely higher than the commonly estimated 30%. The QIAstat Respiratory Panel(?) assay (QIAstat RP) is a multiplexed in vitro diagnostics test for the rapid simultaneous detection of 21 pathogens directly from respiratory samples, including human mastadenovirus A-G, primate bocaparvovirus 1+2, human coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, OC43, 229E), human metapneumovirus A/B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus (no subtype, subtype H1, H1N1/2009, H3), influenza B virus, human respirovirus 1+3, human orthorubulavirus 2+4, human orthopneumovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.

Early detection accompanied by prompt treatment can reduce the risk of death due to breast cancer. Currently, machine learning in cloud computing plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis, but predominantly among the people living in remote areas where medical facilities are scarce. Diagnosis systems based on machine learning act as secondary readers and assist radiologists in the proper diagnosis of diseases, whereas cloud-based systems can support telehealth services and remote diagnostics. Techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANN) have attracted many researchers to explore their capability for disease diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the variants of ANN that has a huge potential for solving various classification problems. The framework proposed in this paper amalgamates three research domains: Firstly, ELM is applied for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Secondly, to eliminate insignificant features, the gain ratio feature selection method is employed. Lastly, a cloud computing-based system for remote diagnosis of breast cancer using ELM is proposed. The performance of the cloud-based ELM is compared with some state-of-the-art technologies for disease diagnosis. The results achieved on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WBCD) dataset indicate that the cloud-based ELM technique outperforms other results. The best performance results of ELM were found for both the standalone and cloud environments, which were compared. The important findings of the experimental results indicate that the accuracy achieved is 0.9868, the recall is 0.9130, the precision is 0.9054, and the F1-score is 0.8129.","output":"Cloud Computing-Based Framework for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Extreme Learning Machine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of epidemics and humanitarian crises, it is essential to translate scientific findings into digestible information for government policy makers who have a short time to make critical decisions.

Thirdly, we suggest that social media plays a largely positive role, despite being described as causing an infodemic, it was used far more to bring communities together.

We quantified the gap between medical appointments available and needed for hypertension care, overall and in relation to hypertension treatment cascade metrics. METHODS: Ecological descriptive analysis. We combined country-year-specific data on hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment and control (from Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration) and number of physicians (from WHO). We estimated from 1 to 12 medical appointments per year for patients with hypertension. We assumed that physicians could see 25 patients per day, work 200 days/year and dedicate 10% of their time to hypertension care. RESULTS: We studied 191 countries. Forty-one countries would not have enough physicians to provide at least one medical appointment per year to all the population with hypertension; these countries were low/lower middle income and in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia and Pacific. Regardless of the world region, 50% of countries would not have enough physicians to provide 8 medical appointments to their population with hypertension. Countries where the demand exceeded the offer of medical appointments for hypertension care had worse hypertension diagnosis, treatment and control rates than countries where the demand did not exceed the offer. There were positive correlations between the physician density and hypertension diagnosis (r=0.70, p<0.001), treatment (r=0.70, p<0.001) and control (r=0.59, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Where physicians are the only healthcare professionals allowed to prescribe antihypertensive medications, particularly in low and middle-income countries, the healthcare system may struggle to deliver antihypertensive treatment to patients with hypertension.","output":"Estimating the gap between demand and supply of medical appointments by physicians for hypertension care: a pooled analysis in 191 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Discrete breed ideals are not restricted to delimiting dog breeds from another, but also are key drivers of subpopulation differentiation. As genetic differentiation due to population fragmentation results in increased rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity, detecting and alleviating the reasons of population fragmentation can provide effective tools for the maintenance of healthy dog breeds. RESULTS: Using a genome-wide SNP array, we detected genetic differentiation to subpopulations in six breeds, Belgian Shepherd, English Greyhound, Finnish Lapphund, Italian Greyhound, Labrador Retriever and Shetland Sheepdog, either due to geographical isolation or as a result of differential breeding strategies. The subpopulation differentiation was strongest in show dog lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Besides geographical differentiation caused by founder effect and lack of gene flow, selection on champion looks or restricted pedigrees is a strong driver of population fragmentation. Artificial barriers for gene flow between the different subpopulations should be recognized, their necessity evaluated critically and perhaps abolished in order to maintain genetic diversity within a breed. Subpopulation differentiation might also result in false positive signals in genome-wide association studies of different traits. LAY SUMMARY: Purebred dogs are, by definition, reproductively isolated from other breeds. However, similar isolation can also occur within a breed due to conflicting breeder ideals and geographic distances between the dog populations. We show here that both of these examples can contribute to breed division, with subsequent loss of genetic variation in the resulting breed lineages. Breeders should avoid creating unnecessary boundaries between breed lineages and facilitate the exchange of dogs between countries.","output":"Variation in breeding practices and geographic isolation drive subpopulation differentiation, contributing to the loss of genetic diversity within dog breed lineages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The provision of elective clinical services has decreased during the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to enable hospitals to focus on acute illness.

Most measures of RNT are disorder-specific and measure e.g. rumination in depression or worry in anxiety. METHODS In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), 1820 adults completed the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire to assess content-independent RNT over a 3-year follow-up period. We investigated the relative stability of content-independent RNT (Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire), over time as well as the association between changes in RNT and changes in affective disorder status (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and depressive and anxiety severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). RESULTS In the total group, baseline RNT was strongly related to RNT three years later, while the difference between the scores at baseline and three years later was negligible. Increases and decreases in RNT were associated with the occurrence and recovery of affective disorders, respectively. Furthermore, changes in RNT between baseline and three years later were associated with corresponding changes in depression, anxiety, and avoidance symptom severity. These associations were small or negligible. LIMITATIONS Our findings may not be representative of all affective disorders as individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder were excluded from our sample.

Already many E. coli and Salmonella outbreaks have been recorded and linked to single a facility [2, 4, 5]. The problem of cross-contamination via surfaces can also be traced, in smaller scale, to households where common areas can accumulate pathogens that can potentially become a threat, especially to more sensitive population groups [6].

While most patients report improved quality of life following surgical intervention, 30% continue to experience chronic abdominal pain. Pre-surgical diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety have been found to significantly predict post-surgical: quality of life, highest experience of pain, anxiety, and parent- and self-reported coping strategies. As such, increasing the coping strategies of pediatric patients with MALS may impact their post-surgical outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to: (1) implement a pre-operative cognitive behavioral therapy protocol with a focus on psychoeducation and coping strategies; and (2) determine feasibility of a pre-surgical intervention for this population. Method: Children (<18 years of age) with a diagnosis of MALS who were eligible for surgical intervention were invited to participate in a 7-week in-person or video-based pre-surgical cognitive behavioral therapy intervention. Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed at baseline and post-surgery; patient-reported distress, pain interference and intensity, health-related quality of life, and health status were assessed at four time points (baseline, week 4, week 7, and post-surgery). Descriptive analyses were used to characterize the sample, assess feasibility outcomes (i.e., attrition rates), and explore symptom-based outcomes across time. Results: Twelve pediatric patients (M age = 15.2  1.7; 91.7% female) and their parents (91.7% mothers) participated. Feasibility metrics based on protocol completion were exceeded for engagement at the stages of consent (68.4% vs. goal of 50%), treatment initiation (92.3% vs. 85%), and treatment completion (84.6% vs. 75%).

This study presents a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blind trial of SILC compared with four-port cholecystectomy (4PLC) with the goal of assessing safety, feasibility, and factors predicting outcomes. METHODS Patients with biliary colic and documented gallstones or polyps or with biliary dyskinesia were randomized to SILC or 4PLC. Data measures included operative details, adverse events, and conversion to 4PLC or laparotomy. Pain, cosmesis, and quality-of-life scores were documented. Patients were followed for 12 months. RESULTS Two hundred patients were randomized to SILC (n = 117) or 4PLC (n = 80) (3 patients chose not to participate after randomization). Patients were similar except for body mass index (BMI), which was lower in the SILC patients (28.9 vs. 31.0, p = 0.011). One SILC patient required conversion to 4PLC. Operative time was longer for SILC (57 vs. 45 min, p < 0.0001), but outcomes, including total adverse events, were similar (34% vs. 38%, p = 0.55). Cosmesis scores favored SILC (p < 0.002), but pain scores were lower for 4PLC (1 point difference in 10-point scale, p < 0.028) despite equal analgesia use. Wound complications were greater after SILC (10% vs. 3%, p = 0.047), but hernia recurrence was equivalent for both procedures (1.3% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.65). Univariate analysis showed female gender, SILC, and younger age to be predictors for increased pain scores, while SILC was associated with improved cosmesis scores. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter randomized controlled trial of SILC versus 4PLC, SILC appears to be safe with a similar biliary complication profile. Pain scores and wound complication rates are higher for SILC; however, cosmesis scores favored SILC. For patients preferring a better cosmetic outcome and willing to accept possible increased postoperative pain, SILC offers a safe alternative to the standard 4PLC.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our analysis shows that delivering Neurological and Neurosurgical teaching via an online platform is a viable and effective method of delivering knowledge. This finding has significant implications not only in the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in the future provision of medical education at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.","output":"EP.TU.426 Evaluating the Efficacy of Online Teaching for Neuroscience, Neurology & Neurosurgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] In the present pandemic time, face masks are found to be the most effective strategy against the spread of the virus within the community. As aerosol-based spreading of the virus is considered as the primary mode of transmission, the interaction of masks with incoming droplets needs to be understood thoroughly for an effective usage among the public. In the present work, we explore the interactions of the droplets over the most commonly used 3-ply surgical masks. A detailed study of the wetting signature, adhesion, and impact dynamics of water droplets and microbe-laden droplets is carried out for both sides of the mask. We found that the interfacial characteristics of the incoming droplets with the mask are very similar for the front and the back side of the mask. Further, in an anticipated attempt to reduce the adhesion, we have tested masks with a superhydrophobic coating. It is found that a superhydrophobic coating may not be the best choice for a regular mask as it can give rise to a number of smaller daughter droplets that can linger in air for longer times and can contribute to the transmission of potential viral loads.","output":"Wetting, Adhesion, and Droplet Impact on Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphene-based point-of-care (PoC) and chemical sensors can be fabricated using photolithographic processes at wafer-scale. However, these approaches are known to leave polymer residues on the graphene surface, which are difficult to remove completely. In addition, graphene growth and transfer processes can introduce defects into the graphene layer. Both defects and resist contamination can affect the homogeneity of graphene-based PoC sensors, leading to inconsistent device performance and unreliable sensing. Sensor reliability is also affected by the harsh chemical environments used for chemical functionalisation of graphene PoC sensors, which can degrade parts of the sensor device. Therefore, a reliable, wafer-scale method of passivation, which isolates the graphene from the rest of the device, protecting the less robust device features from any aggressive chemicals, must be devised. This work covers the application of molecular vapour deposition technology to create a dielectric passivation film that protects graphene-based biosensing devices from harsh chemicals. We utilise a previously reported healing effect of Al(2)O(3) on graphene to reduce photoresist residue from the graphene surface and reduce the prevalence of graphene defects to improve graphene device homogeneity. The improvement in device consistency allows for more reliable, homogeneous graphene devices, that can be fabricated at wafer-scale for sensing and biosensing applications.","output":"Application of Molecular Vapour Deposited Al(2)O(3) for Graphene-Based Biosensor Passivation and Improvements in Graphene Device Homogeneity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the three the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surges in South Korea, there was a shortage of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, and as a result, there were cases of death while waiting for hospitalization. To minimize the risk of death and to allow those confirmed with COVID-19 to safely wait for hospitalization at home, the local government of Gyeonggi-do in South Korea developed a novel home management system (HMS). The HMS team, comprised of doctors and nurses, was organized to operate HMS. HMS provided a two-way channel for the taskforce and patients to monitor the severity of patient's condition and to provide healthcare counseling as needed. In addition, the HMS team cooperated with a triage/bed assignment team to expedite the response in case of an emergency, and managed a database of severity for real-time monitoring of patients. The HMS became operational for the first time in August 2020, initially managing only 181 patients; it currently manages a total of 3,707 patients. The HMS supplemented the government's COVID-19 confirmed case management framework by managing patients waiting at home for hospitalization due to lack of hospital and residential treatment center beds. HMS also could contribute a sense of psychological stability in patients and prevented the situation from worsening by efficient management of hospital beds and reduction of workloads on public healthcare centers. To stabilize and improve the management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, governments should organically develop self-treatment and HMS, and implement a decisive division of roles within the local governments.","output":"The Development and Operation of a Home Management System during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of the Local Government Gyeonggi-do in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is induced by pulmonary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Lung IR injury commonly happens after weaning from extracorporeal circulation, lung transplantation, and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy; it is a lethal perioperative complication. A definite therapeutic intervention remains to be determined. It is known that the enzyme activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critical in maintaining pulmonary vascular tone and epithelial integrity. In a noxious environment to the lungs, inactivation of ACE2 is mainly due to a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) protein-mediated ACE2 shedding. Thus, we assumed that protection of local ACE2 in the lung against ADAM17-mediated shedding would be a therapeutic target for lung IR injury. In this study, we established both in vivo and in vitro models to demonstrate that the damage degree of lung IR injury depends on the loss of ACE2 and ACE2 enzyme dysfunction in lung tissue. Treatment with ACE2 protectant diminazen aceturate (DIZE) maintained higher ACE2 enzyme activity and reduced angiotensin II, angiotensin type 1 receptor, and ADAM17 levels in the lung tissue. Concurrently, DIZE-inhibited oxidative stress and nitrosative stress via p38MAPK and NF-B pathways consequently reduced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1. The underlying molecular mechanism of DIZE contributed to its protective effect against lung IR injury and resulted in the improvement of oxygenation index and ameliorating pulmonary pathological damage. We concluded that DIZE protects the lungs from IR injury via inhibition of ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding.","output":"Diminazen Aceturate Protects Pulmonary Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Inhibition of ADAM17-Mediated Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Shedding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and the mortality is high in severe COVID-19 patients.

In addition, because AIS necessarily elicit evidence of learning from students to drive adaptive decisions, there has long been interest in mining data from these systems for broader assessment purposes such as program evaluation and policy making. Recently, this desire was accelerated by the novel Coronavirus pandemic. It became difficult and in some cases impossible to bring groups of students together to take standardized assessments capable of providing comparable data points suitable for aggregation at district and state levels. Simultaneously, online AIS became a part of daily instruction for many students. This paper examines theories of change that have been proposed for AIS and theories of change commonly associated with assessment and accountability in K-12 education in the United States. It then proposes a conceptual model for hybrid adaptive instructional and assessment systems (AIAS) with the unique contribution of explicitly representing the role of the AIS within the broader assessment eco-system.

These influences may be observed when evaluating changes in pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), which is an important indicator for economic, industrial, and other anthropogenic activities. We utilized a data-driven approach to analyze the relationship between tropospheric NO(2) and COVID-19 mitigation measures by clustering regions based on pollution levels rather than constraining the study units by predetermined administrative boundaries as pollution knows no borders. Specifically, three clusters were discovered signifying mild, moderate, and poor pollution levels. The most severely polluted cluster saw significant reductions in tropospheric NO(2), coinciding with lockdown periods. Based on the clustering results, qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted at global and regional levels to investigate the spatiotemporal changes. In addition, panel regression analysis was utilized to quantify the impact of policy measures on the NO(2) reduction. This study found that a 23.58 score increase in the stringency index (ranging from 0 to 100) can significantly reduce the NO(2) TVCD by 3.2% (p < 0.05) in the poor cluster in 2020, which corresponds to a 13.1% maximum reduction with the most stringent containment and closure policies implemented.

Materials and Methods: We searched for articles published between January 2016 and August 2021 using PubMed/Medline, Embase, ACL Anthology, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To identify the latest relevant methods, we also searched other sources such as preprint servers (eg., medRxiv) via Google Scholar.

We investigated the need for endoscopic procedures, their findings, and impact on patient care in a systematic and geographically diverse sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: As part of the North American Alliance for the Study of Digestive Manifestations of COVID-19, we identified consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at 36 medical centers in the USA and Canada. We performed a secondary analysis of patients who underwent endoscopy, collecting information on endoscopic indications, findings, interventions, staffing, procedure location, anesthesia utilization, and adverse events. RESULTS: Data were collected on 1992 patients; 24 (1.2%) underwent 27 endoscopic procedures (18 upper endoscopies, 7 colonoscopies, 2 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies). The most common indications were: gastrointestinal bleeding (13) and enteral access (6). The most common findings were erosive or inflammatory changes. Ten patients underwent an endoscopic intervention for hemostatic therapy (2), enteral access (6), or biliary obstruction (2). Half of cases employed anesthesiology support; no sedation-related adverse events were reported. One-third of cases were performed in the intensive care setting and one quarter in the endoscopy unit. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, systematic, geographically diverse cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in North America, very few patients underwent endoscopy despite a high prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations.

Patients who experience both asthma and COPD symptoms, referred to as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO), have increased morbidity and healthcare utilization than patients with either disease alone. Methods: We obtained de-identified encounter-level electronic health record (EHR) data for adult asthma and COPD encounters within Penn Medicine occurring between January 1, 2015 and October 31, 2020. Variables extracted included codified demographic information, ICD-10 encounter codes and encounter type (i.e., office visit, hospital encounter, telemedicine or other). Patients were included if they were aged at least 18 years at first encounter and had at least two encounters over a period of at least a year. We classified patients as having asthma, COPD or ACO based on ICD-10 diagnoses (J45? for asthma and J41-44? for COPD) and medication prescriptions (short-acting 2-agonist for asthma and either shortacting 2-agonist or short-acting muscarinic antagonist for COPD), where ACO patients were defined as those meeting asthma and COPD criteria. We compared asthma and COPD healthcare encounters before (pre-pandemic) and after (pandemic) March 17, 2020 in terms of encounter volume and type. We also tested for differences in the demographic distributions of telemedicine vs. in-person visits using t- and 2-tests. Results: A total 66,191 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 46,257 (70%) had asthma, 12,580 (19%) had COPD, and 7,354 (11%) had ACO. Average monthly volume of office visits and hospital encounters for asthma/COPD decreased considerably during the pandemic (&gt;50% decrease in office visits and &gt;25% decrease in hospital encounters across all patient groups), while the volume of telemedicine visits increased dramatically (from 0-1 to 481-1,343 average monthly telemedicine visits across all patient groups) [Figure 1]. During the pandemic, non-Hispanic Black patients were more likely to be encountered via telemedicine than in-person encounters across all patient groups (39% vs. 34% of asthma patients encountered via telemedicine and in-person visits, respectively, were non-Hispanic Black;33% vs. 26% of COPD patients, and 50% vs. 44% among ACO patients;p&lt;0.01 for all comparisons).

Methods We recruited 64 adult participants with high levels of ELS and no diagnosis of a current mental health disorder in addition to 65 controls. Participants completed two online reward learning tasks: the probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT) and probabilistic reward task (PRT). Participants also completed depression, anhedonia, social status and stress scales with PRLT data being additionally analysed utilising a reinforcement learning model. Results Participants with high levels of ELS showed decreased positive feedback sensitivity (PFS) in the PRLT compared to controls. High ELS participants also tended towards possessing a decreased model-free learning rate which strengthened in subsequent analysis. This was coupled with a decreased learning ability in the acquisition phase of block 1 following the practice session. Neither groups of participants showed a reward induced response bias in the PLT however high ELS participants exhibited decreased discrimination ability between stimuli; this was however accounted for by depression symptomology in further analysis.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether CRS is associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. METHODS: Altogether, 219,959 adult patients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (excluding self-referral) were identified in this nested case-control study with propensity score matching. Data on SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19 worsened outcomes (ie, the need for oxygen therapy, intensive care, or mechanical ventilation, and death) were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea.

We undertook a study, in a sheep model of acute brain injury, to assess a new non-invasive brain oximeter. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a pulse and oxygen levels. Methods We studied 8 sheep. An acute increase in intracranial pressure was induced with an injection of blood into the cranial vault. The temporal changes in the brain oximeter, intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were recorded. Simultaneous conventional skin pulse oximetry was also recorded to assess the possible influence of skin blood flow on the brain oximeter signal. Results At baseline, a pulsatile waveform consistent with the brain circulation was obtained in 7 animals. The baseline brain pulse was quite distinct from the simultaneous conventional skin pulse and similar in shape to a central venous pressure waveform. Injection of blood into the cranial vault triggered an immediate increase in intracranial pressure and fall in cerebral perfusion pressure, by 60-s cerebral perfusion pressure recovered. The brain oximeter oxygen levels demonstrated similar changes with an immediate fall and recovery by 60 s. Periods of high intracranial pressure were also associated with high-frequency oscillations in the brain pulse waveform; there was, however, no change in the conventional skin pulse oximeter pulse waveform. Conclusion The brain oximeter detected acute changes in both oxygen levels and the brain pulse waveform following an increase in intracranial pressure levels. The brain oximeter could assist clinicians in the management of acute brain injury.","output":"Assessment of a Non-Invasive Brain Oximeter in a Sheep Model of Acute Brain Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the current global pandemic of the novel coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) continues to rage, the scientific and medical worlds are working to establish an effective therapy against the illness. Recently questions regarding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19 have surfaced. While some studies hint towards the possible benefit of NSAIDs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, the current body of evidence also sheds light on the potential risk of using NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Thus, the available literature does not provide conclusive evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs for treating COVID-19 patients. Given the limited data available, we suggest cautionary approaches for the public to avoid possible harm until further evidence emerges. NSAIDs should not be used as the first-line agents for COVID-19 unlessunder medical supervision. Moreover, patients with chronic inflammatory conditions should continue the NSAIDs as per their regular prescriptions.","output":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs amid COVID-19 pandemic: an ally or an enemy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 vaccines stimulate production of antibodies targeting the spike protein (anti-S). The level of antibodies following vaccination and trajectories of waning may differ between vaccines influencing the level of protection, how soon protection is reduced and, consequently the optimum timing of booster doses. MethodsWe measured SARS-CoV-2 anti-S titre in the context of seronegativity for SARS-CoV-2 anti-Nucleocapsid (anti-N), in samples collected between 1st July and 24th October 2021 in a subset of adults in the Virus Watch community cohort. We compared anti-S levels after BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) or ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca/Oxford) vaccination using time since second dose of vaccination, age, sex and clinical vulnerability to investigate antibody waning. To investigate the use of anti-S levels as a correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we undertook a survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Cox) with individuals entering 21 days after their second dose of vaccine, or first antibody test after 1st July (whichever was latest) and exiting with the outcome of SARS-Cov-2 infection or at the end of follow up 24th October 2021. We also undertook a negative test design case-control analysis of infections occurring after the second vaccine dose (breakthrough infections) to determine whether the type of vaccine affected the risk of becoming infected. Results24049 samples from 8858 individuals (5549 who received a second dose of ChAdOx1 and 3205 BNT162b2) who remained anti-N negative were included in the analysis of anti-S waning over time. Three weeks after the second dose of vaccine BNT162b2 mean anti-S levels were 9039 (95%CI: 7946-10905) U/ml and ChadOx1 were 1025 (95%CI: 917-1146) U/ml. For both vaccines, waning anti-S levels followed a log linear decline from three weeks after the second dose of vaccination. At 20 weeks after the second dose of vaccine, the mean anti-S levels were 1521 (95%CI: 1432-1616) U/ml for BNT162b2 and 342 (95%CI: 322-365) U/ml for ChadOx1. We identified 197 breakthrough infections and found a reduced risk of infection post second dose of vaccine for individuals with anti-S levels greater than or equal to 500 U/ml compared to those with levels under 500 U/ml (HR 0.62; 95%CIs:0.44-0.87; p=0.007). Time to reach an anti-S threshold of 500 U/ml was estimated at 96 days for ChAdOx1 and 257 days for BNT162b2. We found an increased risk of a breakthrough infection for those who received the ChAdOx1 compared to those who received BNT162b2 (OR: 1.43, 95% CIs:1.18-1.73, p<0.001). DiscussionAnti-S levels are substantially higher following the second dose of BNT162b2 compared to ChAdOx1. There is a log linear waning in levels for both vaccines following the second dose. Anti-S levels are an important correlate of protection as demonstrated by those with anti-S levels < 500U/ml following vaccination being at significantly greater risk of subsequent infection. Since anti-S levels are substantially lower in ChAdOx1 than in BNT162b2 and both decline at similar rates we would expect waning immunity to occur earlier in ChAdOx1 compared to BNT162b2. Our results showing an increased risk of breakthrough infections for those who were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 compared to BNT162b2 are in line with this hypothesis. Consistent with our data, national analyses of vaccine effectiveness also suggest that waning of immunity for infection and, to a lesser extent for severe disease, is seen earlier in ChAdOx1 than in BNT162b2. Our data demonstrate the importance of booster doses to maintain protection in the elderly and clinically vulnerable and suggest that these should be prioritised to those who received ChAdOx1 as their primary course.","output":"Waning of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the Spike protein in individuals post second dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines and risk of breakthrough infections: analysis of the Virus Watch community cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 evolution has continued to generate variants, responsible for new pandemic waves locally and globally.

All data was gathered by their own attending physician, and electronic medical records were reviewed individually. Statistical analysis: A descriptive analysis was carried out and a Poisson regression model was adjusted to study associated factors to Health Services use. RESULTS: Out of the 499 patients studied from two health centres, 55.1% were women and mean age was 58.2 (17.3). 25.1% were healthcare professionals. The most frequent symptoms recorded related to COVID-19 were cough (77.9%; CI 95% 46.5C93.4), fever (77.7%; CI95% 46.5C93.4) and dyspnoea (54.1%, CI95% 46.6C61.4). 60.7% were admitted to hospital. 64.5% first established contact with their primary care provider before going to the hospital, with a mean number of 11.4 Healthcare Providers Encounters with primary care during all the follow-up period.

A growing body of information clearly indicates that excess ROS/RNS production and oxidative stress are major detrimental consequences of the most common commercial stressors in poultry production. During evolution, antioxidant defence systems were developed in poultry to survive in an oxygenated atmosphere. They include a complex network of internally synthesised (e.g., antioxidant enzymes, (glutathione) GSH, (coenzyme Q) CoQ) and externally supplied (vitamin E, carotenoids, etc.) antioxidants. In fact, all antioxidants in the body work cooperatively as a team to maintain optimal redox balance in the cell/body. This balance is a key element in providing the necessary conditions for cell signalling, a vital process for regulation of the expression of various genes, stress adaptation and homeostasis maintenance in the body. Since ROS/RNS are considered to be important signalling molecules, their concentration is strictly regulated by the antioxidant defence network in conjunction with various transcription factors and vitagenes. In fact, activation of vitagenes via such transcription factors as Nrf2 leads to an additional synthesis of an array of protective molecules which can deal with increased ROS/RNS production. Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop a system of optimal antioxidant supplementation to help growing/productive birds maintain effective antioxidant defences and redox balance in the body. On the one hand, antioxidants, such as vitamin E, or minerals (e.g., Se, Mn, Cu and Zn) are a compulsory part of the commercial pre-mixes for poultry, and, in most cases, are adequate to meet the physiological requirements in these elements. On the other hand, due to the aforementioned commercially relevant stressors, there is a need for additional support for the antioxidant system in poultry. This new direction in improving antioxidant defences for poultry in stress conditions is related to an opportunity to activate a range of vitagenes (via Nrf2-related mechanisms: superoxide dismutase, SOD; heme oxygenase-1, HO-1; GSH and thioredoxin, or other mechanisms: Heat shock protein (HSP)/heat shock factor (HSP), sirtuins, etc.) to maximise internal AO protection and redox balance maintenance. Therefore, the development of vitagene-regulating nutritional supplements is on the agenda of many commercial companies worldwide.","output":"Antioxidant Defence Systems and Oxidative Stress in Poultry Biology: An Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 negatively impacts students' learning as well as physical and mental health.

Among the contributors to thrombosis, the contact activation system and the kallikrein/kinin system, two overlapping plasma proteolytic systems that are often considered as synonymous, regulate thrombosis from different aspects. On one hand, components of the contact activation system such as factor XII initiates activation of the coagulation proteins promoting thrombus formation on artificial surfaces through factor XI- and possibly prekallikrein-mediated intrinsic coagulation. On the other hand, physiological activation of plasma prekallikrein in the kallikrein/kinin system on endothelial cells liberates bradykinin from associated high-molecular-weight kininogen to stimulate the constitutive bradykinin B2 receptor to generate nitric oxide and prostacyclin to induce vasodilation and counterbalance angiotensin II signaling from the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates vasoconstriction. In addition to vascular tone regulation, this interaction between the kallikrein/kinin and renin-angiotensin systems has a thrombo-regulatory role independent of the contact pathway. At the level of the G-protein coupled receptors of these systems, defective bradykinin signaling due to attenuated bradykinin formation and/or decreased B2 receptor expression, as seen in murine prekallikrein and B2 receptor null mice, respectively, leads to compensatory overexpressed Mas, the receptor for angiotensin-(1-7) of the renin-angiotensin system. Mas stimulation and/or its increased expression contributes to maintaining a healthy vascular homeostasis by generating graded elevation of plasma prostacyclin which reduces thrombosis through two independent pathways: (1) increasing the vasoprotective transcription factor Sirtuin 1 to suppress tissue factor expression, and (2) inhibiting platelet activation. This review will summarize the recent advances in this field that support these understandings.

A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 m traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.","output":"Increased aerosol transmission for B.1.1.7 (alpha variant) over lineage A variant of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Dec 2019, Coronavirus has first shown in China and since then there is a big rise in the number of these cases.

Despite their utility, comprehensive autopsy studies are somewhat lacking relative to the global burden of disease, and very few comprehensive studies contextualize the findings to other fatal viral infections. We developed a novel autopsy protocol in order to perform postmortem examinations on victims of COVID-19 and herein describe detailed clinical information, gross findings, and histologic features observed in the first 16 complete COVID-19 autopsies. We also critically evaluated the role of ancillary studies used to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19 at autopsy, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy (EM). IHC and ISH targeting SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in terms of the location and number of infected cells in lung tissue; however, nonspecific staining of bacteria was seen occasionally with IHC. EM was unrevealing in blindly sampled tissues. We then compared the clinical and histologic features present in this series to six archival cases of fatal seasonal influenza and six archival cases of pandemic influenza from the fourth wave of the 'Spanish Flu' in the winter of 1920. In addition to routine histology, the inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza victims were compared using quantitative IHC. Our results demonstrate that the clinical and histologic features of COVID-19 are similar to those seen in fatal cases of influenza, and the two diseases tend to overlap histologically. There was no significant difference in the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in COVID-19 and influenza at sites of acute lung injury at the time of autopsy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: 4,264 critically ill COVID-19 patients (143 dialysis patients, 521 chronic kidney disease [CKD] patients, and 3,600 patients without CKD) admitted to ICUs at 68 hospitals in the United States. PREDICTOR(S): Presence (versus absence) of pre-existing kidney disease OUTCOME(S): In-hospital mortality (primary); respiratory failure, shock, ventricular arrhythmia/ cardiac arrest, thromboembolic event, major bleed, and acute liver injury (secondary) ANALYTICAL APPROACH: We used standardized differences to compare patient characteristics (values >0.10 indicate a meaningful difference between groups) and multivariable adjusted Fine and Gray survival models to examine outcome associations. RESULTS: Dialysis patients had a shorter time from symptom onset to ICU admission compared to other groups (median [quartile 1-quartile 3] days: 4 [2-9] for dialysis patients; 7 [3-10] for CKD patients; 7 [4-10] for patients without pre-existing kidney disease).

First, we developed an AI model (ECGT2T) to synthesize ten-lead ECG from the asynchronized 2-lead ECG (Lead I and II). ECGT2T is a deep learning model based on a generative adversarial network, which translates source ECGs to reference ECGs by learning styles of the reference ECGs. For this, we included adult patients aged 18 years from hospital A with at least one digitally stored 12-lead ECG. Second, we developed an AI model to detect HFrEF using a 10 s 12-lead ECG. The AI model was based on convolutional neural network. For this, we included adult patients who underwent ECG and echocardiography within 14 days. To validate the AI, we included adult patients from hospital B who underwent two-lead smartwatch ECG and echocardiography on the same day. The AI model generates a 10 s 12-lead ECG from a two-lead smartwatch ECG using ECGT2T and detects HFrEF using the generated 12-lead ECG. Results: We included 137,673 patients with 458,745 ECGs and 38,643 patients with 88,900 ECGs from hospital A for developing the ECGT2T and HFrEF detection models, respectively.

Material and Methods: five apheresis platelet units in 100% plasma were spiked with a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate followed by treatment with amotosalen/UVA (INTERCEPT Blood System), pre- and post-treatment samples were collected as well as untreated positive and negative controls. The infectious viral titer was assessed by plaque assay and the genomic titer by quantitative RT-PCR. To exclude the presence of infectious particles post-pathogen reduction treatment below the limit of detection, three consecutive rounds of passaging on permissive cell lines were conducted.

Recently, a practice-based instrument addressing biopsychosocial aspects of functioning, the Social Medical Work Capacity instrument (SMWC), was developed. Our aim was to examine the content validity of the SMWC using ICF core sets. METHODS: First, we conducted a systematic search to identify relevant ICF core sets for the working age population. Second the content of these core sets were mapped to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of the SMWC. Next, we compared the content of the SMWC with the ICF-core sets. RESULTS: Two work-related core sets and 31 disease-specific core sets were identified. The SMWC and the two work-related core sets overlap on 47 categories. Compared to the work-related core sets, the Body Functions and Activities and Participation are well represented in the new instrument, while the component Environmental factors is under-represented. Compared to the disease-specific core sets, items related to the social and domestic environmental factors are under-represented, while the SMWC included work-related factors complementary to the ICF. CONCLUSION: The SMWC content seems relevant, but could be more comprehensive for the purpose of individual work capacity assessments.

METHODS: The names of US medical schools were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges website (n = 145). Institutional, hospital, and heath encyclopedia websites associated with each schools medical center were identified using Google. Readability of COVID-19 PEMs was calculated using three validated indices: (1) Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level, (2) Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and (3) Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook. Content was evaluated using a scoring matrix based on materials available on the Center for Disease Control website. The Patient Education Material Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT-P) was used to assess usability and actionability. RESULTS: A total of 141 (97%) PEMs met inclusion criteria and were analyzed for readability, content, and quality. The mean readability was above the recommended sixth grade reading level (P < .001).

The primary objective of this study is to create novel, tunable, small-diameter blood vessels with biomimetic two distinct cell layers [vascular endothelial cell (VEC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)] using an advanced coaxial 3D-bioplotter platform. Specifically, the VSMCs were laden in the vessel wall and VECs grew in the lumen to mimic the natural composition of the blood vessel. First, a novel bioink consisting of VSMCs laden in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/polyethylene(glycol)diacrylate/alginate and lyase was designed. This specific design is favorable for nutrient exchange in an ambient environment and simultaneously improves laden cell proliferation in the matrix pore without the space restriction inherent with substance encapsulation. In the vessel wall, the laden VSMCs steadily grew as the alginate was gradually degraded by lyase leaving more space for cell proliferation in matrices. Through computational fluid dynamics simulation, the vessel demonstrated significantly perfusable and mechanical properties under various flow velocities, flow viscosities, and temperature conditions. Moreover, both VSMCs in the scaffold matrix and VECs in the lumen steadily proliferated over time creating a significant two-cell-layered structure. Cell proliferation was confirmed visually through staining the markers of alpha-smooth muscle actin and cluster of differentiation 31, commonly tied to angiogenesis phenomena, in the vessel matrices and lumen, respectively.

So-called 3NFs are optimized short nucleotide sequences able to interact with the transcription factor nuclear factor B (NF-B), which can enhance the nuclear import of plasmid DNA (pDNA) carrying such motifs. In this work, we first designed a consistent set of six pDNAs featuring a common backbone and only varying in their 3NF sequences. These constructions were then transfected under various experimental settings. In vitro, cationic polymer-assisted pDNA delivery in five human-derived cell lines showed the potential advantage of 3NF carrying pDNA in diverse cellular contexts. In vivo, naked pDNAs were hydrodynamically delivered to muscle hindlimbs in healthy mice; this direct accurate comparative (in the absence of any gene carrier) revealed modest but consistent trends in favor of the pDNAs equipped with 3NF. In summary, the results reported emphasize the implications of various parameters on NF-B-mediated pDNA nuclear import; under specific conditions, 3NF can provide modest to substantial advantages for pDNA gene transfer, in vitro as well as in vivo. This study thus further underscores the potential of optimized nuclear import for more efficient non-viral gene transfer applications.","output":"DNA nuclear targeting sequences for enhanced non-viral gene transfer: An in vitro and in vivo study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has inherently affected daily lives of people around the world.

However, because of this pandemic, the global economy has taken a major blow. Many people have lost their livelihood, and now facing challenges in getting better healthcare facilities and food for survival. Given the serious challenges to the problem, this paper analyzes demographic data to predict vulnerable areas in Kolkata metropolitan city that houses nearly one-third of its population in slums and one-fifth below poverty level, under compromised living conditions. The analysis revealed that the highest risk areas are located in the east and west of the city, the area to a great extent overlapped with wards containing larger share of population below poverty level and are also living in slums. The analysis of publicly accessible Covid-19 case records and containment zones data indicate the hardest hit areas lies in the central Kolkata and several wards along the eastern and northeastern border of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The data further revealed that the virus infections have extended to the south Kolkata with increasing number of broad-based containment zones with heightened cases. The analysis of demographic characteristics of the hardest hit wards revealed that not a single variables are directly associated with the increase in the number of containment for a particular ward. The ranking of wards based on four intervention criterion have suggested that the lack of social awareness along with lack of social distancing have dominantly contributed to the increasing number of containment of Covid-19 cases in Kolkata. Determination of optimized ranking and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of the wards based on four intervention criterion provided a basis for the policy makers to assess ward-based interventions criterion to control further spread of the disease and/or prevent second wave of infections.

The concepts of structural stigma and moral distress are important and interrelated, yet rarely explored or researched in medical education. Structural stigma refers to how discrimination towards certain groups is enacted through policy and practice. Moral distress describes the tension and conflict that health workers experience when they are unable to fulfil their duties due to circumstances outside of their control. In this study, the authors explored how resident physicians perceive moral distress in relation to structural stigma. An improved understanding of such experiences may provide insights into how to prepare future physicians to improve health equity. METHODS: Utilizing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22 participants from across Canada including 17 resident physicians from diverse specialties and 5 faculty members were recruited for semi-structured interviews from April-June 2020. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Results describe a distinctive form of moral distress called structural distress, which centers upon the experience of powerlessness leading resident physicians to go above and beyond the call of duty, potentially worsening their psychological well-being. Faculty play a buffering role in mitigating the impact of structural distress by role modeling vulnerability and involving residents in policy decisions. CONCLUSION: These findings provide unique insights into teaching and learning about the care of structurally vulnerable populations and faculty's role related to resident advocacy and decision-making. The concept of structural distress may provide the foundation for future research into the intersection between resident well-being and training related to health equity.","output":"Structural distress: experiences of moral distress related to structural stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our paper aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on private sector companies in terms of sales, production, finance and employment.

Logistic regression is used to assess which factors increase the likelihood of businesses suffering due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that COVID-19 negatively impacts the performance of companies in almost all countries analysed, but a stronger effect is observed among firms from developing countries. The pandemic is more harmful to firms providing services than those representing the manufacturing sector. Due to the pandemic, firms suffer mainly in sales and liquidity decrease rather than employment reduction. The increase in the number of temporary workers is an important factor that significantly reduces the probability of sales, exports or supply decline.

Subjects with diagnosis of OSA treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) were surveyed with a phone-questionnaire to assess the difficulties and knowledge of remote monitoring systems (telemedicine). Furthermore, the participants were divided into two groups according to the favor of telemedicine visits, POSITIVE (in-favor) and NEGATIVE (in favor of in-person visits) and compared with statistical methods. Results: . Fifty-three OSA participants (85% men), aged 67,97,5 yrs and BMI 36,08,0 kg/m 2 were enrolled in the study.

METHODS The clinical data of 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tianjin Third Central Hospital from March 2016 to June 2019 were collected. The basic data of patients, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), causes of ARDS, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), were collected. The CT imaging data of patients on the 1st and 7th day in the ICU were collected. According to the CT value, they were divided into hyperventilated areas (-1 000 to -900 HU), normal ventilation areas (-899 to -500 HU), poorly ventilated areas (-499 to -100 HU), and atelectasis area (-99 to 100 HU). The total lung volume and the percentage of NILT to the total lung volume (NILT%) were calculate. At the same time, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, total length of hospital stay were collected. According to the 28-day follow-up, they were divided into survival group and death group. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for 28-day death in ARDS patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, the area under ROC curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated to determine the accuracy of NILT% in predicting the 28-day prognosis of ARDS patients, and the NILT% threshold was used for subgroup analysis of patients. RESULTS Among the 131 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, patients were excluded for more than 48 hours after ARDS diagnosis, repeated admission to ICU due to ARDS, the ICU duration less than 7 days, death within 72 hours of admission, chronic interstitial lung disease or congestive heart failure, no chest CT examination within 7 days of admission to ICU, and no specimen collection within 2 hours of admission to ICU. Finally, a total of 53 patients were enrolled in the analysis. Of the 53 patients, 31 patients survived and 22 patients died. The 28-day mortality was 41.5%. Compared with the survival group, patients in the death group were older (years old: 65.3211.29 vs. 55.7714.23), and had a higher SOFA score (11.683.82 vs. 8.392.23) with significant differences (both P < 0.05), while there were no significant differences in gender, BMI, ARDS cause, APACHE II score and PaO2/FiO2 between the two groups. There was no significant difference in CT value, total lung volume and NILT% between the two groups at 1st day after admission to ICU; NILT% on day 7 after admission to ICU in the death group was significantly higher than that in the survival group [(28.958.40)% vs. (20.355.91)%, P < 0.01], but there was no significant difference in CT value and total lung volume between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the 28-day prognosis of ARDS was related to age, SOFA score and NILT% independently [age: odds ratio (OR) = 0.892, 95%CI was 0.808-0.984, P = 0.023; SOFA score: OR = 0.574, 95%CI was 0.387-0.852, P = 0.006; NILT%: OR = 0.841, 95%CI was 0.730-0.968, P = 0.016]. ROC curve analysis showed that 7-day NILT% could predict the 28-day prognosis of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, and AUC was 0.810 (95%CI was 0.678-0.952, P < 0.01). The NILT% threshold was 15.50%, sensitivity was 95.5%, specificity was 80.6%, positive predictive value was 85.7%, and negative predictive value was 74.6%. According to the 7-day NILT% threshold, a subgroup analysis of patients was performed, and 7-day NILT% > 15.50% was defined as a high-risk clinical prognosis, and  15.50% was a low-risk. Compared with low-risk patients (n = 7), the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay and total length of hospital stay in high-risk patients (n = 46) were significantly prolonged [duration of mechanical ventilation (days): 9.376.14 vs. 4.431.72, length of ICU stay (days): 12.115.85 vs. 7.571.13, total length of hospital stay (days): 18.395.87 vs. 11.292.22, all P < 0.05].

In particular, while recent studies examined COVID-19 associated arrhythmic risks from cardiac injury and/or from pharmacotherapy such as the combination of azithromycin (AZM) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the role of IL-6 per se in increasing the arrhythmic risk remains poorly understood. The objective is to elucidate the electrophysiological basis of inflammation-associated arrhythmic risk in the presence of AZM and HCQ. IL-6, AZM and HCQ were concomitantly administered to guinea pigs in-vivo and in-vitro. Electrocardiograms, action potentials and ion-currents were analyzed. IL-6 alone or the combination AZM + HCQ induced mild to moderate reduction in heart rate, PR-interval and corrected QT (QTc) in-vivo and in-vitro. Notably, IL-6 alone was more potent than the combination of the two drugs in reducing heart rate, increasing PR-interval and QTc. In addition, the in-vivo or in-vitro combination of IL-6 + AZM + HCQ caused severe bradycardia, conduction abnormalities, QTc prolongation and asystole. These electrocardiographic abnormalities were attenuated in-vivo by tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, and are due in part to the prolongation of action potential duration and selective inhibition of Na(+), Ca(2+) and K(+) currents. Inflammation confers greater risk for arrhythmia than the drug combination therapy. As such, in the setting of elevated IL-6 during inflammation caution must be taken when co-administering drugs known to predispose to fatal arrhythmias and TCZ could be an important player as a novel anti-arrhythmic agent.

Timely and effective predictors for inpatient mortality rate were crucial for improving the management of hospitalized cases. This study aimed to assessed predictors for inpatient mortality of COVID-19 hospitalized adult patients in two diagnosed and treatment centers, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among COVID-19 adult admitted cases in two treatment centers, Northwest Ethiopia, from 1 October 2020 to 30 December 2020. Data from the records of children were extracted using a standardized checklist. Epi-Data version 3.2 was used for data entry, and Stata version 14 was used for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of mortality. Finally, variables with P < 0.05 were a significant predictor of inpatient mortality. RESULT: The mean (standard deviation) age of participant cases was 48.6 (18.8) years. The median (interquartile range) time for death reported after was 13 (6) days. The overall incidence rate inpatient mortality rate was determined as 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 2.15) per100 person per days of observation.

We highlight this phenomenon with a few examples. In the first example, we show how an axionlike particle can have its number abundance parametrically enhanced. In the second example, we demonstrate that the QCD axion can have its number abundance enhanced allowing for misalignment driven axion dark matter all the way down to f_{a} of order astrophysical bounds. In the third example, we show that the delayed oscillation of the scalar field can also sustain a period of inflation. In the last example, we present a situation where an oscillating scalar field is completely frictionless and does not dilute away in time.","output":"Scalars Gliding through an Expanding Universe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has released its Spanish-language COVID-19 mental health resources guide, NAMI COVID-19 Informacin y Recursos The guide features a variety of topics related to mental health and COVID-19, including managing anxiety, finding online communities and accessing affordable services ?It is more important than ever that everyone can access vital information to help keep themselves and their loved ones safe and healthy,? said NAMI CEO Daniel H Gillison Jr ?We hope by providing this resource in Spanish, we will help reduce barriers and increase access to needed mental health services in order to advance NAMI's mission of helping all people affected by mental illness build better lives ?

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to rethink delivery of education. Blended learning (BL), particularly online/eLearning, has become the life support for continued education. BL is a pedagogical approach that combines online asynchronous and/or synchronous and face-to-face (F2F) interaction between lecturers and students, enabling learning to occur independently of time or place. Perceptions and attitudes of students towards BL are important predictors of success. Objective. To determine the attitudes and perceptions of audiology and speech-language pathology students towards BL at the University of Kwa-ZuluNatal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa. Methods. A descriptive survey design with quantitative methods of analysis was used. Eighty-six participants completed an online questionnaire through Google forms. The tool demonstrated good internal consistency, with a Cronbach a score of 0.82. Results. Most participants agreed that combining traditional and eLearning - BL - improves learning skills and enables more student involvement in learning. Comparisons between attitudes and year of study yielded a statistically significant association, with senior students having a more positive attitude towards BL than second-year students (p=0.003). Attitudes between male and female participants were generally similar;however, females felt that BL helped them to understand lecture material better and to increase interaction (statistically significant;p=0.021). While 93% perceived the online platform, Moodle, which is used by UKZN, as being useful, only 51% indicated that it improved efficiency of learning to a great extent. Conclusion. Despite the challenges around connectivity, computer illiteracy, system and technical problems, students concluded that BL enhanced the learning experience and fostered a student-centred approach to teaching and learning.","output":"Is blended learning the way forward?

It causes mild to severe respiratory illness with some flu-like symptoms. The causal virus behind this disease, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), conceivably attacks the receptors of the respiratory system of the human body but has no strict evidence of attacking the blood cells yet. However, patients with hemoglobin disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia, thalassemia) are vulnerable to this global health situation due to their clinical complications. Such patients are generally more prone to viral and bacterial infections, which can worsen their physical condition. Some of these patients present immunocompromised conditions, e.g., splenectomized or post-transplant patients. Therefore, they should follow some preventive steps such as shielding as well as the general guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic. Transfusion dependent patients require regular monitoring for iron overload, and iron chelation therapy may be stopped by the physician depending on the situation.

While healthcare workers (HCWs) have been at the frontlines for the pandemic response, vaccine acceptance amongst them needs further study. MethodsA web-based survey to assess vaccine acceptance and preparedness in India was disseminated to HCWs working in various settings between January and February 2021, shortly after the launch of Indias vaccination campaign. Descriptive statistics were used to examine respondent demographics and Likert scale responses. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. ResultsThe survey yielded 624 respondents from 25 states and five union territories in India; 53.5% were male, and median age was 37 years (IQR 32-46). Amongst all respondents, 84.1% (525/624) supported COVID-19 vaccines, and 63.2% (141/223) of those unvaccinated at the time of survey administration were willing to accept a vaccine. Reliability on government sources, healthcare providers or scientific journal articles for COVID-19 related information was reported by 66.8%, while confidence in social media for this information was reported by only 4.5%. Factors independently associated with vaccine acceptance included advancing age (aOR 3.50 [95% CI, 1.04-11.76] for those above 45 years), evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety (aOR 3.78 [95% CI 1.15-12.38]), and provision of free/no-cost vaccine (aOR 2.63 [95% CI, 1.06-6.50]). Most respondents (80%) were confident about their hospital being equipped to efficiently rollout COVID-19 vaccines to the general population. ConclusionsOverall attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and preparedness were positive among HCWs in India, although acceptance was lower among healthier and younger HCWs. Data availability on vaccine safety and effectiveness, and cost considerations were important for acceptance. Targeted interventions are needed to improve vaccine acceptance amongst HCWs, since they are critical in promoting vaccine acceptance amongst the general population.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers in India: Results from a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. healthcare industry cannot be overstated. Telemedicine utilization increased overnight as all healthcare providers rushed to implement this delivery model to ensure accessibility and continuity of patient care. Our research objective was to determine measures that were implemented to accommodate community and individual patient needs to afford access to critical services and to maintain safety standards. We analyzed literature since 2016 from two databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We compared observations, themes, service lines addressed, issues identified, and interventions requiring in-person care. From 44 articles published, we identified ten effectiveness themes overall and drew conclusions on service line successes. COVID-19 has caused rapid expansion in telemedicine. Necessary and required changes in access, risk mitigation, the need for social distancing, compliance, cost, and patient satisfaction are a few of the driving factors. This review showcased the healthcare industrys ability to rapidly acclimate and change despite the pervasive spread of COVID-19 throughout the U.S. Although imperfect, unique responses were developed within telemedicine platforms to mitigate disruptions broadly and effectively in care and treatment modalities.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Telemedicine Utilization Across Multiple Service Lines in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To examine whether two existing cognitive screeners might be adapted for telephone administration by omission of item content requiring visual cues or assessment.

METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional household survey of 348 families in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from June 25 through July 2, 2020. Unmet need for child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss were assessed using caregiver self-report. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that the greatest unmet child health care need during the COVID-19 pandemic was dental care (16%), followed by medical care for a well visit or vaccination (5%). Approximately 40% of caregivers reported job loss or a decrease in household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found a significant association between the probability of unmet child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss (P = .022). Losing a job or experiencing a decrease in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unmet child dental care (relative risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, 3 times as many households reported unmet dental care for a child compared with unmet medical care. Unmet child dental care was more common in households where pandemic-related job or income loss occurred. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: If unmet dental care continues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nontraditional strategies for delivering dental care can be considered to improve access to dental care for children, such as teledentistry and oral health prevention services in primary care settings.","output":"What is the association between income loss during the COVID-19 pandemic and children's dental care?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesThis study aims to estimate the prevalence and longevity of detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies as well as memory T and B cells after recovery. In addition, the prevalence of COVID-19 reinfection, and the preventive efficacy of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. Methods and analysesA synthesis of existing research was conducted. The Cochrane Library for COVID-19 resources, the China Academic Journals Full Text Database, PubMed, and Scopus as well as preprint servers were searched for studies conducted between 1 January 2020 to 1 April 2021. We included studies with the relevant outcomes of interest. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality and pooled estimates of relevant outcomes were obtained in a meta-analysis using a bias adjusted synthesis method. Proportions were synthesized with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and binary outcomes using the odds ratio (OR).

However, data on outcomes and mortality rates are inconsistent between studies. METHODS: A literature search and meta-analysis were performed on studies reporting the mortality of patients with STEMI admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Additionally, prehospital and intrahospital delay times were evaluated. RESULTS: Outcomes of a total of 50 123 patients from 10 studies were assessed. Our study revealed that, despite a significant reduction in overall admission rates of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic (incidence rate ratio=0.789, 95% CI 0.730 to 0.852, I(2)=77%, p<0.01), there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (OR=1.178, 95% CI 0.926 to 1.498, I(2)=57%, p=0.01) compared with patients with STEMI admitted before the outbreak. Time from the onset of symptoms to first medical contact was similar (mean difference (MD)=33.4 min, 95% CI ?10.2 to 77.1, I(2)=88%, p<0.01) while door-to-balloon time was significantly prolonged in those presenting during the pandemic (MD=7.3 min, 95% CI 3.0 to 11.7, I(2)=95%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in admission of patients with STEMI was not associated with a significant increase of hospital mortality rates. The causes for reduced incidence rates remain speculative. However, the analysed data indicate that acute and timely medical care of these patients has been maintained during the pandemic in most countries.

Thinning of adventitia and dilatation may occur following arterial dissection, thus resulting in a fusiform pseudoaneurysm, which can subsequently cause bleeding, expanding, or pulsatile hematoma. Currently, medical management with anticoagulation remains the first line of treatment and yields good outcomes in 75% of cases with a mortality rate of 3-4%. Endovascular intervention is indicated with failure of medical therapy, progressive enlargement of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm, acute flow-related infarcts due to vessel occlusion, or when anticoagulation is contraindicated due to risk of pseudoaneurysm rupture and hemorrhage. Recognized interventional treatments include parent artery occlusion with or without revascularization, endovascular coil embolization, and covered stenting. Summary A wide variety of endovascular stents are available that are capable of opening a stenosed vessel while obliterating the associated false lumen and providing a scaffold for embolization of the pseudoaneurysm. The use of the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the management of traumatic intracranial pseudoaneurysms has been described. However, there are few reports on the usage of the PED for treating traumatic extracranial ICA dissection and/or pseudoaneurysms. However, a potential complication of the use of PED in the extracranial ICA is a hypothetical tendency to migrate in a mobile vessel. Thus, the risk of migration of the PED has encouraged practitioners to adopt strategies to limit this risk.

Univariable Cox regression models were estimated to evaluate potential prognostic factors for developing COVID-19 and to investigate postoperative mortality among patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. We examined data from 107 patients. (74 lobectomies, 32 wedge/segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy). Twelve patients developed COVID-19 (Group 1), whereas 95 patients were not infected (Group 2). In Group 1, 6 patients (50%) died from complications related to infection; in Group 2, one patient (1%) died because of non-COVID-19-related causes. Median days from surgery to first symptoms, CT confirmation, clinical confirmation and PCR positivity was 48.1, 54.3, 55.1, and 55.2 respectively. At univariable analysis, DLCO/VA% (Pa?=a?0.008), duration of the surgery (Pa?=a?0.009), smoking history (pack/year) (P < 0.001), BMI (P< 0.001) and number of segments resected (Pa?=a?0.010) were associated with COVID-19 onset.

These changes, driven by a complex balance in the air chemistry near the surface, may reflect the influence of low humidity as suggested by Met Office data, and potentially, the reduction of nitrogen oxides and their interactions with multiple pollutants.","output":"UK COVID-19 lockdown: 100 days of air pollution reduction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has quickly become a worldwide pandemic and generated panic threats for both the human population and the global economy. The unavailability of effective vaccines or drugs has enforced researchers to hunt for a potential drug to combat this virus. Plant-derived phytocompounds are of applicable interest in the search for novel drugs. Bioflavonoids from Rhus succedanea are already reported to exert antiviral activity against RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease plays a vital role in viral replication and therefore can be considered as a promising target for drug development. A computational approach has been employed to search for promising potent bioflavonoids from Rhus succedanea against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease. Binding affinities and binding modes between the biflavonoids and Mpro enzyme suggest that all six biflavonoids exhibit possible interaction with the Mpro catalytic site (?19.47 to ?27.04 kcal/mol). However, Amentoflavone (?27.04 kcal/mol) and Agathisflavone (?25.87 kcal/mol) interact strongly with the catalytic residues. Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) further revealed that these two biflavonoids complexes with the Mpro enzyme are highly stable and are of less conformational fluctuations. Also, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface mapping on the Mpro structure as well as biflavonoids were utilized for the further lead optimization process. Altogether, our findings showed that these natural biflavonoids can be utilized as promising SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and thus, the computational approach provides an initial footstep towards experimental studies in in vitro and in vivo, which is necessary for the therapeutic development of novel and safe drugs to control SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: 1. Rhus succedanea biflavonoids have antiviral activity. 2. The molecular interactions and molecular dynamics displayed that all six biflavonoids bound with a good affinity to the same catalytic site of Mpro. 3. The compound Amentoflavone has a strong binding affinity (?27.0441 kcal/mol) towards Mpro. 4. The binding site properties of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro can be utilized in a novel discovery and lead optimization of the SARS-CoV-2-Mpro inhibitor.","output":"Biflavonoids from Rhus succedanea as probable natural inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2: a molecular docking and molecular dynamics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last year the global medical community faced the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Pulmonary function tests were conducted for four times in 37 SARS patients during three-year convalescent period. They were discharged from hospital within one month, three months, one year and three years respectively. At the same time, pulmonary function of 15 healthy persons was examined as controls to be used for comparison. RESULTS Compared with the healthy controls, there were significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), 25%-75% forced expiratory flow (25%-75%FEF) of SARS patients within three years after their discharge from hospital (all P<0.05). There were no significant differences in FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) between the two groups (all P>0.05). Abnormality rate of DLCO in the SARS patients within three years after discharge was significantly decreased (32.4% vs. 5.4%,P<0.05), but no significant differences in FVC, VC, 25%-75%FEF among SARS patients discharged one month and three years from the hospital (all P>0.05). Ten SARS patients showed lower FVC (mild degree in 9 cases, severe degree in 1 case) three years later, 2 patients showed mildly lowered DLCO. CONCLUSION The lung diffusion function of the SARS patients had recovered after they were discharged from hospital within three years, but in 20%-30% patients there is still mild or moderate restrictive ventilation function abnormality and small airway function impairment. The lung functions of most patients have recovered gradually, but in a minority of patients they may be impaired.","output":"[Changes in pulmonary function in SARS patients during the three-year convalescent period]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: The incidence of mother-to-newborn SARS-CoV-2 transmission appears low and may be associated with biological and social factors. However, data are limited on the factors associated with neonatal clinical or viral testing outcomes. Objective: To ascertain the percentage of neonates who were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results during the birth hospitalization, the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with neonatal test result positivity, and the clinical and virological outcomes for newborns during hospitalization and 30 days after discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study included 11 academic or community hospitals in Massachusetts and mother-neonate dyads whose delivery and discharge occurred between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Eligible dyads were identified at each participating hospital through local COVID-19 surveillance and infection control systems. Neonates were born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results within 14 days before to 72 hours after delivery, and neonates were followed up for 30 days after birth hospital discharge. Exposures: Hypothesized maternal risk factors in neonatal test result positivity included maternal COVID-19 symptoms, vaginal delivery, rooming-in practice, Black race or Hispanic ethnicity, and zip code-derived social vulnerability index. Delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms was hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse neonatal health outcomes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes for neonates were (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, (2) indicators of adverse health, and (3) clinical signs and viral testing. Test result positivity was defined as at least 1 positive result on a specimen obtained by nasopharyngeal swab using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Clinical and testing data were obtained from electronic medical records of nonroutine health care visits within 30 days after hospital discharge. Results: The cohort included 255 neonates (mean [SD] gestational age at birth, 37.9 [2.6] weeks; 62 [24.3%] with low birth weight or preterm delivery) with 250 mothers (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.3] years; 121 [48.4%] were of Hispanic ethnicity). Of the 255 neonates who were born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 225 (88.2%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 (2.2%) had positive results during the birth hospitalization. High maternal social vulnerability was associated with higher likelihood of neonatal test result positivity (adjusted odds ratio, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.53-16.01; P = .008), adjusted for maternal COVID-19 symptoms, delivery mode, and rooming-in practice. Adverse outcomes during hospitalization were associated with preterm delivery indicated by worsening maternal COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 151 newborns with follow-up data, 28 had nonroutine clinical visits, 7 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 1 had a positive result. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings emphasize the importance of both biological and social factors in perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were at risk for both direct and indirect adverse health outcomes, supporting efforts of ongoing surveillance of the virus and long-term follow-up.","output":"Association of Maternal Perinatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Neonatal Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic retroviroses can cause widespread morbidity and mortality.

Design: Observational cohort study Setting: Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a large integrated US national healthcare system Participants: 9,058 patients admitted to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center between June 7, 2020-December 5, 2020 within 14-days after SARS-CoV-2 positive test; exclusion criteria include less than a 48 hour stay, receipt of prior systemic corticosteroids, and no indication of acute medical care for COVID-19. Main outcome measure: 90-day all-cause mortality Results: Of 9,058 total patients (95% men, median age 71 years, 27% black), 6,825 (75%) were not on IRS within 48 hours. Among the 3,025 patients on no oxygen, 598 (20%) received corticosteroids and 283 (9%) died; of 3,800 patients on low-flow nasal cannula oxygen (NC), 2,808 (74%) received corticosteroids and 514 (13%) died. In stratified, inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazards models comparing those who did and did not receive corticosteroids, patients on no oxygen experienced an 89% increased risk for 90-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33 to 2.68); there was weak evidence of increased mortality among patients on NC (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.57). Results were robust in subgroup analyses including restricting corticosteroids to dexamethasone, and in sensitivity analyses employing different modeling approaches. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we found no evidence of a mortality benefit associated with early initiation of corticosteroids among those on no oxygen or NC in the first 48 hours, though there was evidence of potential harm. These real-world findings support that clinicians should consider withholding corticosteroids in these populations and further clinical trials may be warranted.","output":"Early initiation of corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 not requiring intensive respiratory support: cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter deals with the core of the book, considering that insect-borne diseases are not only a human matter; there are important effects regarding plants and animals with enormous economic consequences and connected with our first interest: the production of food and its quality. In fact, it is useful to concentrate on the consequences of these diseases for our health, when this is part of the problem. Parasites are interested in any kind of appropriate host and we are generally a secondary target. Therefore, this chapter will be divided into three parts: diseases affecting mankind, animals, and plants. However, first lets consider the general frame of this argument, whose roots are in the distant past. Plague caused the decline of villages, towns, and empires, changing the direction of history. Plague is no longer a menace to humanity, and this is clearly evidenced by the improvements of medicine and hygiene in the last centuriesbut it can return. It depends, as in the past, on us. Several factors are changing the impact and the occurrence of insect-borne diseases, although most of general aspects are maintained and have been present for a long time. Thanks to recent analytic techniques, it is possible to explain new aspects of the presence and diffusion of these diseases, as well as their past, present, and future impacts. Information about the main current insect-borne diseases is reported and divided into four steps. First, the story of the plague is presented as the most important one in the past. Later, diseases affecting mankind, animals, and plants are reported. In particular, the influences of environmental change, introduction of alien species, and new alerts are considered. The outbreaks concerning malaria, Bluetongue, and Xylella are reported in detail as model cases of current interest.

However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article explores the possibility of COVID 19 induced diabetes and highlights a potential bidirectional link between COVID 19 and T1DM. METHODS: A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases till October 2020, using relevant keywords (COVID-19 induced diabetes; COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes; COVID-19 induced DKA; new-onset diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection) to extract relevant studies describing relationship between COVID-19 and T1DM. RESULTS: Past lessons and new data teach us that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) can enter islet cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and cause reversible ?-cell damage and transient hyperglycemia.

We utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyds tragic death on May 25, 2020, to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Our sample period spans from January 22, 2020, to June 20, 2020, and consists of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the change in COVID-19 case counts following the protests, we employ a differences-in-differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting, in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties. We also control for covariates that may influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and implement placebo tests using a Monte Carlo simulation. Findings: We document a country-wide increase of over 3  06 cases per day, per 100,000 population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2  47 C 3  65 ), and a further increase of 1  73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place (95%CI: 0  59 C 2  87 ). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests, this represents a 61  2 % country-wide increase in the infection rate, and a further 34  6 % increase in the protest counties. Interpretation: Our study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance.

The United Kingdom surgical associations and Colleges of Surgeons collectively recommended the addition of CT Thorax to all emergency CT abdomen/pelvis imaging in order to help identify possible COVID-19 patients. Early identification of these patients would lead to optimal treatment strategies for the patient and protection for staff members. However, an extension of CT would be associated with increased irradiation doses for the patient, and its diagnostic relevance was unclear. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational review looking at all surgical admissions that required a CT Thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis across 7 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic, across four Scottish Hospitals. CT thorax investigations (of non-surgical patients) were also re-assessed by a single radiologist to assess the extent of pathology identified at the lung bases (and therefore would be included in a standard CT abdomen and pelvis). RESULTS: Of 216 patients identified who had a CT thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis during the timeframe, 5 were diagnosed with COVID-19. During this timeframe, 77 patients underwent solely CT thorax. Across the entire cohort, 98% of COVID pathology was identified at the lung bases. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of CT thorax was 60 and 86.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a region with relatively low prevalence of SARS-COV2 infection, inclusion of CT Thorax in surgical admission imaging does not significantly contribute to identification and management of SARS-COV2 patients. We therefore suggest that imaging the lung bases can be sufficient to raise clinical suspicion of COVID-19. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This paper adds further evidence to that from other single UK centres that the addition of CT chest for all patients does not yield any further diagnostic information regarding coronavirus. Additionally, rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in the UK (which is currently widely available) further demonstrates that inclusion of the entire chest during CT examination of the acute abdomen is not required.","output":"Assessing the role of the universal addition of CT thorax to CT abdomen and pelvis in the COVID era.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in 60 women with abnormal uterine bleeding undergoing TLH. They were divided into three groups based on the energy devices used, namely integrated bipolar and ultrasonic energy (Thunderbeat), ultrasonic (Harmonic) and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (Ligasure). Cytokines and chemokines were measured in all three groups at different time points. RESULTS Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) increased postsurgery in all three groups and gradually declined by 72 hours. The geometric mean serum (IL)-6 levels was highest with Ligasure at 24 hours as compared with the other groups. Levels of TNF-, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1) , MIP-1  were also higher at 3 hours in the Ligasure group. When the differences between the groups were measured at different time points, there was a significantly greater increase in serum IL-6 levels in the Ligasure group at 24 hours (p=0.010).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for the development of LCS. RESULTS: Of the 50,402 COVID-19 patients included into this analysis, 1,708 (3.4%) were diagnosed with LCS.

RESULTS: Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.

In this scenario, availability of biomarkers is a priority. MS-based Proteomics techniques were used to profile the proteome of 81 plasma samples extracted in four consecutive days from 23 hospitalized COVID-19 associated pneumonia patients. Samples from 10 subjects that reached a critical condition during their hospital stay and 10 matched non-severe controls were drawn before the administration of any COVID-19 specific treatment and used to identify potential biomarkers of COVID-19 prognosis. Additionally, we compared the proteome of five patients before and after glucocorticoids and tocilizumab treatment, to assess the changes induced by the therapy on our selected candidates. Forty-two proteins were differentially expressed between patients' evolution groups at 10% FDR. Twelve proteins showed lower levels in critical patients (fold-changes 1.20C3.58), of which OAS3 and COG5 found their expression increased after COVID-19 specific therapy. Most of the 30 proteins over-expressed in critical patients (fold-changes 1.17C4.43) were linked to inflammation, coagulation, lipids metabolism, complement or immunoglobulins, and a third of them decreased their expression after treatment. We propose a set of candidate proteins for biomarkers of COVID-19 prognosis at the time of hospital admission.

Pathogen genome sequencing has emerged as the primary tool for variant characterization, so it is important to consider the number of sequences needed when designing surveillance programs or studies, both to ensure accurate conclusions and to optimize use of limited resources. However, current approaches to calculating sample size for variant monitoring often do not account for the biological and logistical processes that can bias which infections are detected and which samples are ultimately selected for sequencing. In this manuscript, we introduce a framework that models the full process from infection detection to variant characterization and demonstrate how to use this framework to calculate appropriate sample sizes for sequencing-based surveillance studies. We consider both cross-sectional and continuous sampling, and we have implemented our method in a publicly available tool that allows users to estimate necessary sample sizes given a specific aim (e.g., variant detection or measuring variant prevalence) and sampling method.

This observation is reinforced by our structural determination of nirmatrelvir bound to the omicron Mpro at 1.63[A] resolution.

Objective: To assess the course of illness and final outcome in patients who received RDV at various stages of illness, and compare it to the non-RDV group. Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of 1262 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from May5, 2020 to August 31, 2020. The primary outcomes were progression to mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. Kaplan Meier survival analysis and log rank test were used for evaluating primary outcomes. Results: 398 patients comprised the RDV group and 260 patients comprised the non-RDV group. 2/3rd of patients were above 50 years of age in both the groups and 3/4th patients were male. Mortality rate was 5.8% in RDV group (10.4% in non-RDV group). Mortality rate was 3.6%, 4% and 16.7% when RDV was started within 5 days, 5 to 10 days and after 10 days of symptom onset respectively. Fewer patients in RDV group progressed to MV (4.0% v/s 8.2%). Earlier discharge occurred in RDV group. Use of supplemental oxygen was observed in 44.7% patients in RDV group (54.2% in non-RDV group). No significant adverse events were observed with RDV. Survival analysis showed that probability of event (death) was significant for patients with hypertension (HT) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) in RDV group.

Our article aims of comparing and interpreting between-country trends of mortality rate, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality. METHODS: We used data from open databases (Our World in Data mostly) for comparing mortality of eleven western countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Between-country trends in mortality rate and case-fatality (both including deaths for COVID-19 as numerator and therefore labelled as COVID-19 mortality metrics) and all-cause excess mortality (i.e. observed deaths during the epidemic compared with those expected based on mortality in the same periods of previous years) were compared. RESULTS: Although Belgium ranks first in mortality from COVID-19 (possibly due to the broadest criterion for attributing a death to COVID-19), it does not rank first for all-cause excess mortality. Conversely, compared with Belgium, the UK, Italy and Spain have reported lower COVID-19 mortality (possibly due to the narrower definitions for a COVID-19 death) but higher all-cause excess mortality. Germany and Austria are the unique countries for which COVID-19 mortality, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality consistently exhibited the lowest rates. CONCLUSION: Between-country heterogeneity of COVID-19 mortality metrics could be largely explained by differences of criteria for attributing a death to COVID-19; in age/comorbidity structures; in policies for identifying asymptomatic people affected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. All-cause excess mortality is recommended as a more reliable metric for comparing countries.","output":"Lessons from COVID-19 mortality data across countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internationally, medical students Internet Addiction (IA) is widely studied.

Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey. A t total of 707 individual Bangladeshi wage earners were enrolled between 20 and 30 May 2020. The questionnaire had sections on sociodemographic information, COVID-19 related questions, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. STATA version 14.1 program was used to carry out all the analyses. Results: The study revealed that 58.6 and 55.9% of the respondents had moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The total monthly income was <30,000 BDT (353.73USD) and displayed increased odds of suffering from depressive symptoms (OR = 4.12; 95% CI: 2.68C6.34) and anxiety (OR = 3.31; 95% CI: 2.17C5.03).

Demographic and obstetric profile of women, their abortion choices, method of termination, difficulty in accessibility, and level of psychological distress were studied. Results: A total of 52 women were provided SAS during the study period. The number of women coming for SAS during lockdown was 47.1% less than that after easing of the lockdown. During the lockdown, women came at a later period of gestation with a mean of 9.5 weeks compared to 7.5 weeks in the later three months. Because of fear of COVID-19, 19.2% (n=10) women opted for termination of pregnancy. Increased need of contraception was felt but 40% (n=12) had problems of accessibility. More women had probable serious mental illness during the lockdown period (p=0.008). Conclusion: Lockdown during the pandemic decreased the number of women coming for SAS due to barriers in accessibility. Contraceptive needs are also increased but access is difficult. The need for safe abortion services and contraception has increased during the pandemic but the lockdown caused inaccessibility. Psychological distress is prevalent, and fear of COVID-19 has become a common reason for termination of pregnancy. This pandemic can be taken as an opportunity to provide and improve contraception and abortion accessibility, and quality with integration of mental health support.","output":"Safe abortion services during the COVID -19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of an extended multi-year COVID-19 pandemic on corporate planning.

This review extracted and analyzed data from the UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank malnutrition estimates to present an overall picture of childhood stunting in the region. The number of children under 5 in the region who are affected by stunting has dropped from 24.5 million (40%) in 1990 to 20.6 million (24.2%) in 2019. The reduction rate since the 2012 baseline is only about two fifths of that required and much more rapid progress will be needed to reach the internationally agreed targets by 2025 and 2030. Prevalence is highest in low-income countries and those with a lower Human Development Index. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undermine efforts to reduce stunting, through its impact on access and affordability of safe and nutritious foods and access to important health services. Priority areas for action to tackle stunting as part of a comprehensive, multisectoral nutrition strategy are proposed. In light of the threat that COVID-19 will exacerbate the already heavy burden of malnutrition in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, implementation of such strategies is more important than ever.","output":"Tackling Childhood Stunting in the Eastern Mediterranean Region in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM To evaluate the CVC-related infection rate according to catheter insertion site and to analyze the risk factors for catheter-related local infections (CRLI) and bloodstream infections (CRBSI) among severe trauma patients. METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 736 severe trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score of >15. Poisson regression was used to compare the infection rates according to the catheter insertion sites. Univariate analysis of the groups with and without CVC-related infection was used to identify confounding variables for inclusion in multivariate models that were used to identify the risk factors for CRLI and CRBSI. RESULTS We evaluated 1646 catheter insertions and their duration of insertion and found 1241 subclavian (18,461 days), 251 internal jugular (3454 days), and 154 femoral catheters (1526 days). The CRLI infection rate per 1000 catheter days was significantly lower for subclavian, compared to that for internal jugular (4.83 vs. 9.55, respectively; P < 0.001) and femoral catheters (4.83 vs. 7.93, respectively; P = 0.013). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that catheter insertion duration [odds ratio (95 % confidence interval): 1.035 (1.021-1.050), P < 0.001] and subclavian access [0.532 (0.366-0.775), P < 0.001] were significantly associated with CRLI, while catheter insertion duration [1.024 (1.002-1.046), P = 0.032] was significantly associated with CRBSI.

This article summarizes the main developments over the past six months and provides the reader with an overview of the details of each of these developments. The first six months of 2020 have continued to be dominated by State aid cases, be it decisions by the European Commission (Commission') to approve State aid applications, appeals of those or previously decided State aid cases, or the handing down of judgments from the General court. It is to be expected that for years to come, State aid decisions will form a significantly greater part of the competition law diet. In the six-month period, looking only at COVID-19 pandemic related cases/decision: at least sixteen Commission State aid decisions related to compensating undertakings for the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;twelve Commission State aid decisions were appealed to the General court (mostly by Ryanair);and we are now seeing a significant number of judgments from the General Court relating to some of the Commission's COVID-19 State aid decisions. In this period, Ryanair scored equal numbers of successful and unsuccessful appeals. Taking a quick look at the State aid applications submitted to the Commission State, a number of measures were submitted under Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU'), which enables the Commission to approve State aid granted to compensate specific companies or specific sectors for the damages directly caused by exceptional occurrences'. Few could ever contest that the COVID-19 pandemic would not qualify as an exceptional occurrence' it was an extraordinary, unforeseeable event having a significant economic impact globally. As a result, the interventions by the Member States to compensate for the damages directly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic were considered justified. The Commission is also empowered to assess State aid measures requested by Member States under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, which enables it to approve State aid granted to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State. Again, few would dispute that the COVID-19 pandemic caused serious disturbances in the economies of EU Member States. The final main mechanism to consider State aid is the Temporary Framework specifically set up by the Commission to enable the quick approval of State aid providing that the measures fell within defined parameters. In relation to mergers, there are only five mergers mentioned, of which one reference the abandonment out of the Air Canada/Air Transat transaction after an in-depth investigation lasting more than eleven months. It should be noted that as a direct result of commitments regularly imposed by the Commission in State aid decisions under the Temporary Framework, recipients of State aid (like Air France, TUI, Finavia, Riga Airport etc.) are in principle prohibited from acquiring shares in competing or related markets, and this may have a dampening effect on merger activities in the aviation sector. ? 2021 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.

The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) has estimated swab-positivity approximately monthly since May 2020 in England from RT-PCR testing of self-administered throat and nose swabs in random non-overlapping cross-sectional community samples. Estimating infection incidence from swab-positivity requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab positivity in the community. MethodsDuring round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, of the 2,282 participants who tested RT-PCR positive, we recruited 896 (39%) from whom we collected up to two additional swabs for RT-PCR approximately 6 and 9 days after the initial swab. We estimated sensitivity and duration of positivity using an exponential model of positivity decay, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. Estimates of infection incidence were obtained for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study using P-splines. ResultsWe estimated the overall sensitivity of REACT-1 to detect virus on a single swab as 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) and median duration of positivity following a positive test as 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater median duration of positivity where there was a low N-gene Ct value, in those exhibiting symptoms, or for infection with the Alpha variant. The estimated proportion of positive individuals detected on first swab, P0, was found to be higher for those with an initially low N-gene Ct value and those who were pre-symptomatic. When compared to swab-positivity, estimates of infection incidence over the duration of REACT-1 included sharper features with evident transient increases around the time of key changes in social distancing measures. DiscussionHome self-swabbing for RT-PCR based on a single swab, as implemented in REACT-1, has high overall sensitivity. However, participants time-since-infection, symptom status and viral lineage affect the probability of detection and the duration of positivity. These results validate previous efforts to estimate incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from swab-positivity data, and provide a reliable means to obtain community infection estimates to inform policy response.","output":"Characterising the persistence of RT-PCR positivity and incidence in a community survey of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An important number of antiviral agents used in clinical practice are amino acids, short peptides, or peptidomimetics.

Postponing cancer treatment without consideration of its implications could cost more lives than can be saved. In this special situation, we must continue to provide our cancer patients with the highest quality of medical services assuring the safety. This article provides general guidance on supporting curative treatment strategies in vulvar cancer patients. METHODS: At our institution, a vulvar cancer multidisciplinary team (Vul.Can MDT) of specialists is responsible for personalized treatment of this disease. The phase 2 period necessarily requires specific procedures for both outpatient and inpatient pathways and to provide strategies concerning the management of vulvar cancer patients even in case of an eventually concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. In brief, an accurate remote and in person triage must be provided routinely and patients submitted to specific diagnostic tests prior to every major treatment or procedure (surgery, RT, and CT) or in case of suspicion for COVID-19 syndrome. The decisional workflow for these women often old and frail, have been rapidly adjusted by our Vul.Can MDT to mitigate the potential risks of COVID-19. RESULTS: The team produced two types of recommendations concerning: (1) safety regulations of care pathways, patients and health care providers, (2) personalized treatment strategies. We present a protocol that can be applied in clinical practice: the flowcharts provided, include the modulation of treatment intensity designed for surgical procedures and radiation, stratified for FIGO stage of disease and intention.

While the majority of those exposed have minor symptoms and recover with little morbidity, an estimated 500,000 people succumb to IAV-related complications each year worldwide. In these severe cases, an exaggerated inflammatory response, known as cytokine storm, occurs which results in damage to the respiratory epithelial barrier and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data from retrospective human studies as well as experimental animal models of influenza virus infection highlight the fine line between an excessive and an inadequate immune response, where the host response must balance viral clearance with exuberant inflammation. Current pharmacological modulators of inflammation, including corticosteroids and statins, have not been successful in improving outcomes during influenza virus infection. We have reported that the amplitude of the inflammatory response is regulated by Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) activity and that dampening of LUBAC activity is protective during severe influenza virus infection. Therapeutic modulation of LUBAC activity may be crucial to improve outcomes during severe influenza virus infection, as it functions as a molecular rheostat of the host response. Here we review the evidence for modulating inflammation to ameliorate influenza virus infection-induced lung injury, data on current anti-inflammatory strategies, and potential new avenues to target viral inflammation and improve outcomes.","output":"Targeting the Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex to Modulate the Host Response and Improve Influenza A Virus Induced Lung Injury()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to understand how Covid-19 contagious disease and the EU's policy response may affect macroeconomic performance Previous studies on this topic have used historical data sets on \\"rare macroeconomic disasters\\" such as Great Influenza to assess the impact of the current pandemic on the global economy The authors examine the main channels of transmission and targeted policy response to mitigate crisis qualitatively The authors use heuristics and apply qualitative trend-based analysis because the current pandemic is a unique event for which accurate quantitative data are not currently available Researchers first identify a set of eight variables based on previous academic theories They then express each variable as a trend: ascending, descending, and constant The numerical calculations consist of 17 scenarios, supplemented by 24 transitions and a transition graph Besides, the article proposes a graphical solution to examine the change in GDP that is too small The results of the study should be understood as a reference point to allow both private and public stakeholders to understand better the relationship between the observed variables and their dynamics The research provides a comprehensive list of future events to examine further the implications for the economy as a whole and each individual [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Technological & Economic Development of Economy is the property of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The Covid-19 Disease and Policy Response to Mitigate the Economic Impact in the Eu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the role that the environment plays in influencing public health often involves collecting and studying large, complex data sets.

Finally, the transparent and respectful sharing of palliative care team experiences in the year preceding the conference established a safe environment for both individual expression and scholarly discussion.","output":"The inaugural United States World Hospice and Palliative Care Day Celebration: A virtual coming together."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As plans for expanding fossil fuel infrastructure continue to ramp up despite threats to the planet, how are geographers to address the criminalisation and prosecution of peaceful acts of defending earth, water and land? Reflecting on a courtroom ethnography and debates spanning legal geography, political ecology and social movements studies, this article explores embodied struggles around oil, justice and geographies of caring C discussing how Indigenous youth, grandmothers in their eighties and others were convicted of criminal contempt for being on a road near an oil pipeline expansion project. The project (Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion) was created to transport unprecedented levels of heavy oil (bitumen) across hundreds of kilometres of Indigenous peoples' territory that was never ceded to settler-colonial authorities in Canada. Focusing on a controversial injunction designed to protect oil industry expansion, the discussion explores the performativity of a judge's exercise of power, including in denying the necessity to act defence, side-lining Indigenous jurisdiction, and escalating prison sentences. Courtroom ethnography offers a unique vantage point for witnessing power at work and vast resources used by state actors to suppress issues fundamental to the United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Paris Climate Accord. It also provides a lens into the intersectional solidarity and ethics of care among those who dare to challenge colonialism and hyper-extractivism, inviting engagement with multiple meanings of irreparable harm at various scales. The article calls for more attention to power relations, values and affects shaping courtroom dynamics in an age in which fossil fuel interests, climate crisis and settler-colonial control over courts are entwined in evermore-complex violent entanglements.","output":"Climate injustice, criminalisation of land protection and anti-colonial solidarity: Courtroom ethnography in an age of fossil fuel violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesDuring a pandemic, healthcare providers experience increased mental and physical burden. Burnout can lead to treatment errors, patient mortality, increased suicidal ideation and substance abuse as well as medical malpractice suits among medical staff. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of burnout, acute stress disorder, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder among healthcare providers at the third month of the COVID-19 pandemic.DesignA cross-sectional facility-based survey.SettingHospitals around the country with different levels of care.ParticipantsA total of 1795 respondents, including 360 men and 1435 women who participated in the survey.Primary outcome measuresBurnout was assessed using the Physician Work Life Study. A score of 3 implied burnout.ResultsOf the 1795 respondents, 723 (40.3%) reported burnout, and 669 (37.3%) cared for patients with COVID-19. Anxiety levels were mild in 185 (10.3%) respondents, moderate in 209 (11.6%) and severe in 1401 (78.1%). The mean Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 score was 9.56.3, and 817 (45.5%) respondents were classified as having depression. Factors associated with burnout were working in acute and critical care (ACC) divisions (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.84, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.39, p=0.019), caring for patients with COVID-19 (aOR=3.90, 95% CI 1.14 to 13.37, p=0.031) and having depressive disorder (aOR=9.44, 95% CI 7.44 to 11.97, p<0.001).ConclusionsPhysicians and nurses are vulnerable to burnout during a pandemic, especially those working in ACC divisions. Anxiety disorder, depressive disorder and care of patients with COVID-19 may be factors that influence the occurrence of burnout among healthcare providers.","output":"Mental health crisis in healthcare providers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional facility-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For preventing the spread of epidemics such as the coronavirus disease COVID-19, social distancing and the isolation of infected persons are crucial.

In our analysis, we outline collective insecurity at two levels: the micro level of migrant workers' daily, subjective experiences of insecurity;and the macro level, in which insecurity is a consequence of structural forces, specifically the globalization of labor. These two levels interact symbiotically, producing states of insecurity that are concretely experienced as anxiety and fear. Migrant workers in Malaysia also practice agency through small forms of resistance that they use to bolster one another and reduce their insecure experiences. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, migrant workers have been further marginalized by the state, but they have also become connected to one another through acts of solidarity and resistance.

Eight kinds of IVD kits-four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, two lateral flow rapid immunochromatographic assays, and two chemiluminescent immunoassays with one RUO kit were tested. RESULTS: Among 40 serum samples from 15 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, 35 yielded at least one positive result for detecting antibodies in the combined assessment. There were inconsistent results in 12 (28%) samples by single immunoassay. Forty samples collected in 2019 before the first COVID-19 Korean case showed negative results except for one equivocal result.

The results will be used to design a discrete choice experiment study to inform the development of resident burnout prevention programs. METHODS: Three resident focus groups met (10C14 participants/group) to prioritize a list of 23 factors for burnout prevention programs. The Nominal Group Technique consisted of three steps: an individual, confidential ranking of the 23 factors by importance from 1 to 23, a group discussion of each attribute, including a group review of the rankings, and an opportunity to alter the original ranking across participants. RESULTS: The total number of residents (36) were a representative sample of specialty, year of residency, and sex. There was strong agreement about the most highly rated attributes which grouped naturally into themes of autonomy, meaning, competency and relatedness. There was also disagreement on several of the attributes that is likely due to the differences in residency specialty and subsequently rotation requirements. CONCLUSION: This study identified the need to address multiple organizational factors that may lead to physician burnout. There is a clear need for complex interventions that target systemic and program level factors rather than focus on individual interventions. These results may help residency program directors understand the specific attributes of a burnout prevention program valued by residents. Aligning burnout interventions with resident preferences could improve the efficacy of burnout prevention programs by improving adoption of, and satisfaction with, these programs. Physician burnout is a work-related syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment [1]. Burnout is present in epidemic proportions and was estimated to occur in over 50 percent of practicing physicians and in up to 89 percent of resident physicians pre-COVID 19. The burnout epidemic is growing; a recent national survey of US physicians reported an 8.9 percent increase in burnout between 2011 and 2014 [2]. Rates of physician burnout have also increased [3] during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new classification of pandemic burnout experienced by over 52 percent of healthcare workers as early as June of 2020 [4]. Physician burnout can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and relationship problems that may progress to substance abuse, increased interpersonal conflicts, broken relationships, low quality of life, major depression, and suicide [5C7]. The estimated rate of physician suicide is 300C400 annually [8C10].","output":"Using nominal group technique among resident physicians to identify key attributes of a burnout prevention program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 should closely be cared because of the relatively high mortality rate. If SARS-CoV-2 could be cleared as soon as possible, the mortality rate might lower. In the present study, we analyzed factors which might be related to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight severe COVID-19 cases were enrolled. All of them had been isolated and treated at the Third Peoples Hospital of Shenzhen because they were positive for nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 tested by qRT-PCR. Their baseline clinical characteristics and antiviral regimens were collected and analyzed, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 128 enrolled severe COVID-19 cases, unfortunately 3 died. The mean viral duration of all patients was 23.5 (range 17-32) days. All patients achieved viral clearance during 9 weeks. 13.4 % of patients achieved viral clearance within 2 weeks, and 63.0% of patients achieved viral clearance within 4 weeks. The combined regimens of three or more antiviral drugs, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and late admission might be related to the delay of viral clearance within 2 weeks. The use of arbidol, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and late admission might be related to the delay of viral clearance within 4 weeks. Patients often had a prolonged course of COVID-19 and hospitalization, and were more likely transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment, if they could not clear SARS-CoV-2 during 23 days.

There are currently no appropriate interventions or treatments for Cr(VI) exposure during pregnancy. Herein, the protective effect of melatonin (MLT) against Cr(VI)-induced reprotoxicity is investigated by administrating MLT to pregnant mice exposed to Cr(VI). The results indicate that MLT effectively alleviates Cr(VI)-induced adverse pregnancy outcomes, restoring the decreased fetal weight and increased fetal resorption and malformation caused by Cr(VI) exposure to normal levels. MLT reduces the negative effects of Cr(VI) on follicular atresia and the development of primordial follicle in the maternal ovarian, thereby mitigating the decline in the reserve of primordial follicles. MLT alleviates Cr(VI)-induced oxidative stress, hence reducing the excessive accumulation of malondialdehyde in the maternal ovary. MLT inhibits Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the ovary. MLT reduces the increase in serum follicle-stimulating hormone caused by Cr(VI) exposure, while elevating anti-Mullerian hormone levels. We demonstrate that MLT reverses Cr(VI)-induced reprotoxicity in pregnant mice, opening up a new avenue for treating reproductive defects caused by environmental stress.","output":"New insights into the reverse of chromium-induced reprotoxicity of pregnant mice by melatonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare worker (HCW)-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of global concern due to the potential for nosocomial spread and depletion of staff numbers. However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. AIM: To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. METHODS: Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work, and ethnicity. FINDINGS: COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-White ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical care had lower rates than the emergency department (ED), but rates in the ED declined when all staff were advised to use personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: Sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. Current PPE appears to be effective when used appropriately.

Participants filled the questionnaires 1-2 weeks after the start of the lockdown and 3-4 weeks after the first measurement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Complaints of sleep and daytime functioning difficulties during the period of self-isolation are common in 19-30% and depend not so much on the level and content of anxiety, but on its dysfunctional level that interferes with everyday activities (=0.17-0.27, p<0.05, R2=2.8-7.4%).

METHODS: Chest computed tomography (CT) studies in 303 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 were reviewed by 3 fellowship-trained chest radiologists. Cases were assigned an impression of typical, indeterminate, atypical, or negative for COVID-19 pneumonia according to the RSNA expert consensus statement reporting guidelines, and interobserver analysis was performed. Objective CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and distribution of findings were recorded. RESULTS: The Fleiss kappa for all observers was almost perfect for typical (0.815), atypical (0.806), and negative (0.962) COVID-19 appearances (P < .0001) and substantial (0.636) for indeterminate COVID-19 appearance (P < .0001). Using Cramer V analysis, there were very strong correlations between all radiologists' interpretations, statistically significant for all (typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative) COVID-19 appearances (P < .001). Objective CT imaging findings were recorded in similar percentages of typical cases by all observers. CONCLUSION: The RSNA expert consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to COVID-19 demonstrates substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreement among chest radiologists in a relatively large cohort of patients with clinically suspected COVID-19.

METHODS: We assessed the contributions of gender in attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, using a hypothetical influenza pandemic data from the 2014 Taiwan Social Change Survey. Participants were selected through a stratified, three-stage probability proportional-to-size sampling from across the nation, to fill in questionnaires that asked about their perception of the hypothetical pandemic, and intention to adopt health protective behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 1,990 participants (median age 45.92 years, 49% women) were included. Significant gender disparities (p<0.001) were observed. The risk perception of pandemic (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.21-1.35, p<0.001), older age (1.06, 95%=1.05-1.07, p<0.001), female gender (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.09-1.27, p<0.001), higher education (OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.06-1.13, p<0.001), and larger family size (OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.06-1.15, p<0.001) were positively associated with health protective behaviors.

The Standard Model breaks charge conjugation parity (CP) symmetry, but not in a sufficient amount to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. Historically one of the first systems to be studied in the search of symmetry breaking within the Standard Model is the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The contribution to the neutron EDM coming from the SM is several order of magnitudes smaller than the current experimental bound, thus providing a unique, background-free window for potential discovery of physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The strong CP-violating [Formula: see text] term can also contribute to the neutron EDM, as can all the CP-violating effective operators describing, at energies below the electro-weak scale, the contributions from BSM.

That approach allows students to investigate the implications of new model parameters in a systematic way. Students fit the resulting models to reported cases-per-day data for the United States using least-squares techniques with Excel's Solver.

They also discover that the effects of social distancing can be modeled using a Gaussian transition function for the infection rate coefficient and that the summer surge was caused by prematurely relaxing social distancing and then reimposing stricter social distancing. Students then model the effect of vaccinations and validate the resulting SIRV model by showing that it successfully predicts the reported cases-per-day data from Thanksgiving through February 14, 2021. The same SIRV model is then extended and successfully fits the fourth peak up to June 1, 2021, caused by further relaxation of social distancing measures. Finally, students extend the model up to the present day and successfully account for the appearance of the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. The fitted model also predicts that the delta-variant peak will be comparatively short, and the cases-per-day data should begin to fall off in early September 2021 - counter to current expectations. This case study would make an excellent capstone experience for students interested in scientific modeling.","output":"Introductory models of COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Many extraglottic airway devices allow the direct passage of an adult-sized tracheal tube, but this is not possible with the LMA-Supreme(TM) . We evaluated the feasibility of using the LMA-Supreme(TM) as a conduit for intubation in patients with known difficult airways. METHODS Sixty-eight adult patients, with preoperative predictors of difficult intubation, were scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. After assessing the direct laryngoscopy view, 23 patients with Cormack-Lehane III/IV were included in the study. An LMA-Supreme(TM) was inserted, followed by the passage of a flexible bronchoscope loaded with an Aintree Intubation Catheter into the trachea. The bronchoscope and LMA-Supreme(TM) were removed, and a tracheal tube was railroaded over the Aintree Intubation Catheter into the trachea.

The risk factors associated with disease severity were investigated. RESULTS Non-severe (1,214; 77.7%) and severe cases (349; 22.3%) were enrolled in the study. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group were significantly older and had more comorbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Smoking was more common in the severe group. Severe patients had higher respiratory rates and higher incidences of cough and dyspnea compared to non-severe patients. Compared to the non-severe patients, the severe patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CRP/albumin ratio and decreased albumin.

However, as communication skills training (CST) programs are not seen as a priority to many clinical departments, there is a discernible absence of a standardised, recommended framework for these programs to be built upon. This systematic scoping review (SSR) aims to gather prevailing data on existing CSTs to identify key factors in teaching and assessing communication skills in the postgraduate medical setting. METHODS: Independent searches across seven bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar) were carried out. Krishnas Systematic Evidence-Based Approach (SEBA) was used to guide concurrent thematic and content analysis of the data. The themes and categories identified were compared and combined where possible in keeping with this approach and then compared with the tabulated summaries of the included articles. RESULTS: Twenty-five thousand eight hundred ninety-four abstracts were identified, and 151 articles were included and analysed. The Split Approach revealed similar categories and themes: curriculum design, teaching methods, curriculum content, assessment methods, integration into curriculum, and facilitators and barriers to CST. Amidst a wide variety of curricula designs, efforts to develop the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes set out by the ACGME current teaching and assessment methods in CST maybe categorised into didactic and interactive methods and assessed along Kirkpatricks Four Levels of Learning Evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: A major flaw in existing CSTs is a lack of curriculum structure, focus and standardisation. Based upon the findings and current design principles identified in this SSR in SEBA, we forward a stepwise approach to designing CST programs. These involve 1) defining goals and learning objectives, 2) identifying target population and ideal characteristics, 3) determining curriculum structure, 4) ensuring adequate resources and mitigating barriers, 5) determining curriculum content, and 6) assessing learners and adopting quality improvement processes.

The urological literature on the topic is sparse. Objective To perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate all the available studies on urological applications of telehealth. Evidence acquisition After registration on PROSPERO, we searched PubMed and Scopus databases to collect any kind of studies evaluating any telehealth interventions in any urological conditions. The National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies was used to estimate the risk of bias. A narrative synthesis was performed. Evidence synthesis We identified 45 studies (11 concerning prostate cancer [PCa], three hematuria management, six urinary stones, 14 urinary incontinence [UI], five urinary tract infections [UTIs], and six other conditions), including 12 randomized controlled trials. The available literature indicates that telemedicine has been implemented successfully in several common clinical scenarios, including the decision-making process following a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa, follow-up care of patients with localized PCa after curative treatments, initial diagnosis of hematuria, management diagnosis and follow-up care of uncomplicated urinary stones and uncomplicated UTIs, and initial evaluation, behavioral therapies, and pelvic floor muscle training in UI patients, as well as follow-up care after surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse. The methodological quality of most of the reports was good. Conclusions Telehealth has been implemented successfully in selected patients with PCa, UI, pelvic organ prolapse, uncomplicated urinary stones, and UTIs. Many urological conditions are suitable for telehealth, but more studies are needed on other highly prevalent urological malignant and benign conditions. Likely, the COVID-19 pandemic will give a significant boost to the use of telemedicine. More robust data on long-term efficacy, safety, and health economics are necessary. Patient summary The diffusion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections has recently increased the interest in telehealth, which is the adoption of telecommunication to deliver any health care activity.

Evidence on those at greatest risk for poor outcomes if infected with COVID-19 has rapidly come to light. It has become clear that those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics, chronic disease risk factors and/or a confirmed diagnosis of one or more chronic conditions are at greatest risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death if infected with COVID-19.

Despite the fact that data on the safety of IOM are available, the significance and predictive value of the procedure are still under discussion. Moreover, cases of false-negative monitoring affect the surgeon's confidence in IOM. OBJECTIVE To examine cases of false-negative IOM to reveal structural explanations. METHODS Between 2007 and 2010, we resected 115 consecutive supratentorial gliomas in or close to eloquent motor areas using direct cortical stimulation for monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The monitoring data were reviewed and related to new postoperative motor deficit and postoperative imaging. Clinical outcomes were assessed during follow-up. RESULTS Monitoring of MEPs was successful in 112 cases (97.4%). Postoperatively, 30.3% of patients had a new motor deficit, which remained permanent in 12.5%. Progression-free follow-up was 9.7 months (range, 2 weeks-40.6 months). In 65.2% of all cases, MEPs were stable throughout the operation, but 8.9% showed a new temporary motor deficit, whereas 4.5% (5 patients) presented with permanently deteriorated motor function representing false-negative monitoring at first glance. However, these cases were caused by secondary hemorrhage, ischemia, or resection of the supplementary motor area. CONCLUSION Continuous MEP monitoring provides reliable monitoring of the motor system, influences the course of operation in some cases, and has to be regarded as the standard for IOM of the motor system.

We investigated the barriers and opportunities to maximise uptake and utilisation of molecular diagnostics in routine healthcare settings. METHODS: Using the implementation of WHO approved TB diagnostics, Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin (MTB/RIF) and Line Probe Assay (LPA) as a benchmark, we evaluated the barriers and how they could be unlocked to maximise uptake and utilisation of molecular diagnostics. RESULTS: Health officers representing 190 districts/counties participated in the survey across Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The survey findings were corroborated by 145 healthcare facility (HCF) audits and 11 policy-maker engagement workshops. Xpert MTB/RIF coverage was 66%, falling behind microscopy and clinical diagnosis by 33% and 1%, respectively. Stratified by HCF type, Xpert MTB/RIF implementation was 56%, 96% and 95% at district, regional and national referral hospital levels. LPA coverage was 4%, 3% below culture across the three countries. Out of 111 HCFs with Xpert MTB/RIF, 37 (33%) used it to full capacity, performing 8 tests per day of which 51% of these were level five (zonal consultant and national referral) HCFs. Likewise, 75% of LPA was available at level five HCFs. Underutilisation of Xpert MTB/RIF and LPA was mainly attributed to inadequateutilities, 26% and human resource, 22%. Underfinancing was the main reason underlying failure to acquire molecular diagnostics. Second to underfinancing was lack of awareness with 33% healthcare administrators and 49% practitioners were unaware of LPA as TB diagnostic. Creation of a national health tax and decentralising its management was proposed by policy-makers as a booster of domestic financing needed to increase access to diagnostics. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest higher uptake and utilisation of molecular diagnostics at tertiary level HCFs contrary to the WHO recommendation.

Persons who attended a CPR course from January 2000 through February 2003 answered a structured questionnaire. The respondents' willingness to perform SCPR or CCPR during a witnessed cardiac arrest of an average adult stranger or that of a family member in the pre-SARS and the post-SARS era was surveyed. RESULTS Data for 305 respondents were processed. For the scenario of cardiac arrest of an average stranger, more respondents would perform CCPR than SCPR in the pre-SARS era (83.6% vs. 61.3%, p <0.001) and in the post-SARS era (77.4% vs. 28.9%, p <0.001). In the scenario of the cardiac arrest of a family member, more would perform CCPR than SCPR in the pre-SARS era (92.8% vs. 87.2%, p <0.001) and in the post-SARS era (92.8% vs. 84.9%, p <0.001). After SARS, more respondents were unwilling to perform SCPR (p <0.001) and CCPR (p <0.001) on strangers. After SARS, more respondents were unwilling to perform SCPR on a family member (p = 0.039), but there was no difference in the preference to perform CCPR (p = 1.000).

These changes are concentrated in the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) and the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of complex modular spike protein trimers. The impact of this hypervariability on virus entry is often unclear, particularly with respect to sarbecovirus NTD variations. Therefore, we constructed indels and substitutions within hypervariable NTD regions and used severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus-like particles and quantitative virus-cell entry assays to elucidate spike structures controlling this initial infection stage. We identified NTD variations that increased SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and cell entry. Increased cell entry correlated with greater presentation of RBDs to ACE2 receptors. This revealed a significant allosteric effect, in that changes within the NTDs can orient RBDs for effective virus-cell binding. Yet, those NTD changes elevating receptor binding and membrane fusion also reduced interdomain associations, leaving spikes on virus-like particles susceptible to irreversible inactivation. These findings parallel those obtained decades ago, in which comparisons of murine coronavirus spike protein variants established inverse relationships between membrane fusion potential and virus stability. Considerable hypervariability in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTDs also appear to be driven by counterbalancing pressures for effective virus-cell entry and durable extracellular virus infectivity.

The Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of host cell and as such it is the target of many countermeasures including vaccines. Most of these therapeutics focus only on the ectodomain of the protein leaving the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein largely unexplored. Our study focuses on the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein as it conserved amongst coronaviruses. This domain contains numerous highly conserved cysteine (cys) residues that are potential sites of S-palmitoylation;a post-translational modification mediated by the host enzymes (palmitoyltransferases) that add palmitate to the target protein. In other coronaviruses, palmitoylation of the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein is required for its partitioning into de novo synthesized viral progeny. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. We have found that the Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues. Additionally, increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation of Spike while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced palmitoylation as well as the ability of the human coronavirus 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. We used a fatty acid synthase inhibitor TVB-3166 to reduce palmitoyl-CoA levels which in turn eliminated palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2 Spike. Treating cells with TVB-3166 attenuates the ability of human coronavirus 229E to form plaques and promoted the survival of mice from a lethal murine coronavirus infection.

Herein, free energy perturbation (FEP) was used to predict substrate affinity for both host and viral enzymes. Several uridine 5'-monophosphate prodrug analogs known to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) were utilized in this study to validate the use of FEP. Binding free energies to the host monophosphate kinase and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were calculated for methyl-substituted uridine analogs. The 2'-C-methyl-uridine and 4'-C-methyl-uridine scaffolds delivered favorable substrate binding to the host kinase and HCV RdRp that were consistent with results from cellular antiviral activity in support of our new approach. In a prospective evaluation, FEP results suggest that 2'-C-dimethyl-uridine scaffold delivered favorable monophosphate and triphosphate substrates for both host kinase and HCV RdRp, respectively. Novel 2'-C-dimethyl-uridine monophosphate prodrug were synthesized and exhibited sub-micromolar inhibition of HCV replication. Using this novel approach we demonstrated for the first time that nucleoside analogs can be rationally designed that meet the multi-target requirements for antiviral activity.","output":"In Silico Design of a Novel Nucleotide Antiviral Agent by Free Energy Perturbation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: loneliness is a common experience for adolescents, yet the voices of adolescents are missing from current conceptualisations of loneliness. That means, measures that have been created based on current conceptualisations may miss important contexts of adolescence, such as the roles of friendships, that determine the way loneliness is experienced. The current study aims to centre adolescent voices to identify how they conceptualise loneliness and what strategies they consider to be useful for adolescents to cope with loneliness. Method: thematic framework analysis (TFA) was conducted on qualitative interviews with young people aged 8C14 years in Belgium and Italy to identify salient themes in their conceptualisations of loneliness. Results: Loneliness was conceptualised as a negative emotional state involving negative thinking patterns that occurs when an individual perceives they are missing out on a desired aspect in their social relationships. Coping strategies related to alleviating negative affect, and aiding social reconnection. Conclusions: friendships with peers were understood to be central to adolescent loneliness experiences. In line with that, loneliness was seen to be experienced at school.

This study investigated the effect of etiology and duration of OL on gray matter volume (GMV) of these regions in 257 patients. Voxel-based morphometry was applied to measure GMV in brain regions of interest to test the effects of etiology and duration on regional GMV and the relation between olfactory function and regional GMV. Etiology of OL had a significant effect on GMV in clusters representing the gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), bilaterally. Patients with congenital anosmia had reduced GMV in the gyrus rectus and an increased OFC volume compared to patients with acquired OL. There was a significant association between volume of the left OFC and olfactory function. This implies that changes in GMV in patients with acquired OL are mainly reflected in the OFC and depend on olfactory function. Morphology of olfactory areas in the brain therefore seems to relate to olfactory function and the subsequent degree of exposure to olfactory input in patients with acquired OL. Differences in GMV in congenital anosmia are most likely due to the fact that patients were never able to smell.","output":"Investigating morphological changes in the brain in relation to etiology and duration of olfactory dysfunction with voxel-based morphometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An excessive inflammatory response in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high disease severity and mortality. Specific acute phase reactants might be useful for risk stratification. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies on serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched, covering the period January 2020 to December 2020, for studies reporting SAA concentrations, COVID-19 severity, and survival status. RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 5617 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that SAA concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe disease and non-survivors (standard mean difference (SMD) 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.91-1.49, P < 0.001). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 92.4%, P < 0.001). In the sensitivity analysis, the effect size was not significantly affected when each study was removed in turn (range 1.10-1.29). The Begg test (P = 0.030), but not the Egger test (P = 0.385), revealed the presence of publication bias. Pooled SMD values were significantly and positively associated with sex (t = 2.20, P = 0.047) and aspartate aminotransferase (t = 3.44, P = 0.014).

The liver is the major site for iron storage, and conditions of iron overload have been established to have a pathogenic role in development of liver diseases. We presented here six patients who developed severe COVID-19, with biochemical evidence of liver failure. Three cases were survived patients, who underwent liver biopsy; the other three were deceased patients, who were autopsied. None of the patients suffered underlying liver pathologies. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses were performed. The most striking finding we demonstrated in all patients was iron accumulation into hepatocytes, associated with degenerative changes. Abundant ferritin particles were found enclosed in siderosomes, and large aggregates of hemosiderin were found, often in close contact with damaged mitochondria. Iron-caused oxidative stress may be responsible for mitochondria metabolic dysfunction. In agreement with this, association between mitochondria and lipid droplets was also found.

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. Methods: In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. Findings: We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. Interpretation: With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

Globally, limited data exist on TDR and SD among blood donors. In this study, drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and SD amongst HIV-1 sero-positive blood donors in Accra, Ghana were characterized. METHODS: Purposive sampling method was used to collect 81 HIV sero-positive blood samples from the Southern Area Blood Center and confirmed by INNO-LIA as HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. Viral RNA was only extracted from plasma samples confirmed as HIV-1 positive. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the RNA as a template and subsequently amplified by nested PCR with specific primers. The expected products were verified, purified and sequenced. Neighbour-joining tree with the Kimuras 2-parameter distances was generated with the RT sequences using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 6.0 (MEGA 6.0). RESULTS: Out of the 81 plasma samples, 60 (74%) were confirmed as HIV-1 sero-positive by INNO-LIA HIVI/II Score kit with no HIV-2 and dual HIV-1/2 infections. The remaining samples, 21 (26%) were confirmed as HIV sero-negative. Of the 60 confirmed positive samples, (32) 53% and (28) 47% were successfully amplified in the RT and PR genes respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified samples revealed the presence of major drug resistance mutations in two (2) samples; E138A in one sample and another with K65R. HIV-1 Subtypes including subtypes A, B, CRF02_AG and CRF09_cpx were found. CONCLUSION: This study found major drug resistance mutations, E138A and K65R in the RT gene that confer high level resistance to most NNRTIs and NRTI respectively. CRF02_AG was most predominant, the recorded percentage of subtype B and the evolutionary relationship inferred by phylogenetic analysis may suggest possible subtype importation.

Herein, we design high-strength and anti-biofouling poly(amidoxime) nanofiber membranes (HA-PAO NFMs) via a supramolecular crosslinking. Bacterial cellulose supplies the NFMs with ultrathin fiber structure, and large amounts of adsorption ligands are immobilized on the framework via the crosslinking with antibacterial ions. Thus, different from other fibers, HA-PAO NFMs achieve ultrathin diameter (20-30 nm), high BET area (51 m2 g-1), and excellent mechanical strength (13.6 MPa). The uranium adsorption capacity reaches to 409 mg-U/g-Ads in the simulated seawater, 99.2% uranium can be removed from the U-contained wastewater, and the adsorption process can be observed by the naked eye due to the significant color changes. The inhibition zones indicate their excellent anti-biofouling ability, which contributes to 1.83 times more uranium extraction amount from natural seawater than the non-antifouling adsorbents.

Nafamostat has been shown to have other, immunomodulatory effects, which may be beneficial for treatment, however animal models of ssRNA virus infection are lacking. In this study, we examined the potential of the dual TLR7/8 agonist R848 to mimic the host response to a ssRNA virus infection and the associated behavioural response. In addition, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of nafamostat in this model. Methods: : CD-1 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of R848 (200g, prepared in DMSO, diluted 1:10 in saline) or diluted DMSO alone, and an intravenous injection of either nafamostat (100L, 3mg/kg in saline) or saline. Sickness behaviour was determined by temperature, food intake, sucrose preference test, open field and forced swim test. Blood and fresh liver, lung and brain were collected 6 hours post-challenge to measure markers of peripheral and central inflammation by blood analysis and qPCR. Results: : R848 induced a robust inflammatory response, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-, CXCL1 and CXCL10 in the liver, lung and brain, as well as a sickness behaviour phenotype. Exogenous administration of nafamostat suppressed the hepatic inflammatory response, significantly reducing TNF and IFN- expression, but had no effect on lung or brain cytokine production. R848 administration depleted circulating leukocytes, which was restored by nafamostat treatment. Conclusions: : Our data indicate that R848 administration provides a useful model of ssRNA virus infection, which induces inflammation in the periphery and CNS, and virus infection-like illness. In turn, we show that nafamostat has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect, in the presence of the TLR7/8 agonist. Therefore, the results indicate that nafamostat has anti-inflammatory actions, beyond its ability to inhibit TMPRSS2, that might potentiate its anti-viral actions in pathologies such as COVID-19.","output":"Nafamostat reduces systemic inflammation in TLR7-mediated virus-like illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Preliminary results showed some benefits of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) over conventional laparoscopic colectomy, including better cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and faster recovery, but these results need further confirmation. In addition, the literature still lacks comparative studies between the two approaches to prove the above-mentioned advantages of SILS over conventional laparoscopy and, most importantly, its equivalent effectiveness in terms of initial oncological results. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two consecutive series of 10 patients undergoing three-port conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (3PCL-RH) and single-incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, respectively, were compared in their short-term surgical and oncological outcomes. RESULTS Analysis of perioperative and postoperative outcomes revealed no significant differences between the two groups. In the SILS group an anastomotic leakage occurred, which was conservatively treated by continuous drainage, total parental nutrition, and antibiotic therapy. The analysis of oncological outcomes showed no differences in terms of length of distal tumor-free margin and harvest of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Despite its feasibility for right hemicolectomy and its equivalent short-term surgical and oncological outcome compared with conventional laparoscopy, SILS demonstrated no significant advantages in terms of surgical incision length and postoperative course compared with 3PCL-RH. We acknowledge that the small sample size and the nonrandomized design are a limit of the study.

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00C3.00) and 8.00 (11.00C5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30C49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

Since December 2019, COVID-19 corona virus disease 2019 outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has occurred in China and many countries around the world. Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be quickly screened. The antimalarial drug Chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The dosage used according to current clinical recommended dosage and course of treatment are larger than that of previous treatment of malaria.

As a traditional distance education institution, UNISA had to refine digitalization in a time of decolonization in the Global South. This case study examined the role of educational managers in sustaining effective digitalization. Eight UNISA managers were selected and interviewed to understand how they perceived the role of digital leaders. Furthermore, the study sought to understand why it is critical that managers should be in the forefront of digitalization. The study found that at present in Africa it is critical for digitalization to be combined with decolonization. Additionally, when digitalization and decolonization are implemented simultaneously, they become vehicles for social justice and democracy. This then means that education can be a tool for liberation and achievement where the digital divide is minimized. When implemented well, education institutions become institutions with access for success. The conclusions show that a set strategy based on a new vision for a university will harness digital leadership.

Those nanoparticles exhibited a spin glass like behaviour at a temperature around 9 K. The samples showed electronic conduction arising out of small polaron hopping between the Ni2+ and Ni3+ species present in the material. A large magnetodielectric parameter with a maximum value of 52.2% was observed in the sample at room temperature which resulted from the Maxwell-Wagner polarization effect. This was explained as arising due to a large negative magnetoresistance caused by spin polarized electron hopping between Ni2+ and Ni3+ sites with the consequential formation of space charge polarization at the interfaces of the NiO nanoparticles. This was substantiated by direct measurement of magnetoresistance of the samples which gave identical results. It is believed that negative magnetoresistance after direct measurement occurred due to the interaction between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases and the value was 37%, the highest reported in the literature so far. As a result of the presence of Ni3+ ions, antiferromagnetic phase and ferromagnetic like behaviour of NiO nanoparticles gave higher magnetization than other reported nanoparticles.

This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications. Results: We identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty).

At the time of writing, COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles seems beyond reach with such short series. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. We show that transformed daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly) and that shorter wavelength cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post-lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors.

However, many populations exhibit variation in warning signals.

Examining these mechanisms and their effects requires first confirming whether the most common morphs are favored at both local and regional scales. Empirical examples of this are uncommon and often include potentially confounding factors, such as a lack of knowledge of predator identity and behavior. We tested how bird behavior influences the survival of three coexisting morphs of the aposematic wood tiger moth Arctia plantaginis offered to a sympatric predator (great tit Parus major) at different frequencies. We found that although positive frequency-dependent selection is present, its strength is affected by predator characteristics and varying prey profitability.

While sugammadex has been shown to be effective in minimising residual paralysis, uncertainty exists as to whether its use reduces any associated morbidity. We designed this trial to determine if the use of sugammadex for the reversal of intraoperative aminosteroid neuromuscular blockade results in improvements in postoperative pulmonary complications, complications in the recovery unit, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient satisfaction, when compared to reversal with neostigmine. Methods: A prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in adult patients admitted for surgical operations at two Australian hospitals between December 2018 and March 2019 was performed comparing the reversal of neuromuscular paralysis using sugammadex 2mg/kg versus neostigmine 50mcg/kg. Statistical analysis of continuous data was performed using two tailed t-tests, with categorical and ordinal data was assessed by Chi-squared analysis. Results: The trial was terminated due to a combination of resource constraints and the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Of 51 patients screened, 33 were eligible for participation and 30 subsequently recruited and randomised. All patients received the intended treatment allocated. Data for the primary outcome was obtained in all patients. There was no difference in the rates of postoperative pulmonary complications between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups (0% (0/19) vs 9% (1/11) RR 5.0 (95%CI 0.22-113) p=0.37.

In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA).

Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals.

However, several studies have demonstrated that hyperuricemia is closely related to systemic inflammation and has oxidant properties effects, both of which may increase the risk of muscle strength loss. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of serum UA concentration with grip strength and leg extension power in adult men. METHODS This study is a cross-sectional survey in which 630 Japanese male employees aged 30 years and older participated. Five hundred and eighty-six subjects participated in the measurement of grip strength, and 355 subjects participated in the measurement of leg extension power. Blood samples were obtained for serum UA analysis. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounders, grip strength differed significantly between participants with and those without hyperuricemia (geometric mean and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.3 [39.2-41.3] kg vs. 41.9 [41.3-42.5] kg; P = 0.01). In addition, serum UA levels (quartiles) showed an inverted J-shaped curve with grip strength (mean and 95% CI: Q1, 41.6 [40.6-42.6] kg; Q2, 42.2 [41.2-43.2] kg; Q3, 41.8 [40.8-42.8] kg; Q4, 40.4 [39.3-41.4] kg; P for quadratic trend = 0.05).

It acts to keep alveoli from collapsing during the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. After its secretion, lung surfactant forms a lattice structure on the alveolar surface, known as tubular myelin. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A, B, C and D make up to 10% of the total surfactant. SP-B and SPC are relatively small hydrophobic proteins, and are involved in the reduction of surface-tension at the air-liquid interface. SP-A and SP-D, on the other hand, are large oligomeric, hydrophilic proteins that belong to the collagenous Ca(2+)-dependent C-type lectin family (known as Collectins), and play an important role in host defense and in the recycling and transport of lung surfactant (Awasthi 2010) (Fig. 43.1). In particular, there is increasing evidence that surfactant-associated proteins A and -D (SP-A and SP-D, respectively) contribute to the host defense against inhaled microorganisms (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_24 and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_25). Based on their ability to recognize pathogens and to regulate the host defense, SP-A and SP-D have been recently categorized as Secretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors. While SP-A and SP-D were first identified in the lung; the expression of these proteins has also been observed at other mucosal surfaces, such as lacrimal glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, genitourinary epithelium and periodontal surfaces. SP-A is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. This chapter gives an overview on the understanding of role of SP-A and SP-D in for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research to further elucidate the role of these molecules in adult lung diseases.

AIM: Comparative analysis of prior viral presence on seminal fluid against current (preliminary) findings for SARS-CoV-2 to predict biological implications of the novel coronavirus upon current sexual transmissibility, viral presence, and reproductive health. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. ZIKV and EBOV were found to be present in semen and to be sexually transmitted, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to update their guidelines on prevention of the two viruses to include refraining from sexual contact. There are conflicting studies regarding the presence of SARS-CoV in male reproductive tissue, but it has been linked to testicular atrophy and orchitis. To date, two studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen, while seven studies have reported no positive detection.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of otolaryngology clinic appointments at academic institutions have been moved to telemedicine in order to limit interpersonal contacts. At the height of the pandemic, our institution has protocolized scribe participation from in-person to remote. Scribes have virtually participated in telemedicine appointments in an effort to facilitate documentation and enhance the patient-physician relationship. Beyond the pandemic, as patients start being evaluated in-person, the risk of contamination and spread through aerosol generating procedures has limited the number of ancillary support staff that can be present in the examination rooms. As such, virtual scribing from a separate location within the clinic has been deemed warranted. This paper documents the protocols on virtual scribing for both telemedicine and a hybrid approach for in-clinic appointments where high-risk procedures are being performed.","output":"Virtual scribing within otolaryngology during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has produced alterations in the behaviour and psychological health of people, who have had to learn living under uncertain circumstances escaping their control. This situation has been aggravated in those countries applying strict home confinement rules to try bending their epidemic curve. This is the case of Spain, where the stringent lockdown period was extended over three months. This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure (GI) during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health. To this end, La Palma (Canary Islands) and Zaragoza (Peninsular Spain) were taken as case studies, since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenrys self-reported mental health under strict lockdown conditions. A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress, anger, medication use, alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI, whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas. Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis, they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation, aesthetical or sporting purposes. The joint consideration of these psychological gains with the social and environmental benefits provided by GI emphasizes the importance of approaching urban regeneration through the design and implementation of interconnected green spaces.","output":"Spatial statistical analysis of the relationship between self-reported mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown and closeness to green infrastructure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mercury is a well-known toxic metal, which induces oxidative stress. Pancreatic beta-cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress. The pathophysiological effect of mercury on the function of pancreatic beta-cells remains unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of methylmercury (MeHg)-induced oxidative stress on the cell viability and function of pancreatic beta-cells. The number of viable cells was reduced 24 h after MeHg treatment in a dose-dependent manner with a range from 1 to 20 microM. 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence as an indicator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation after exposure of HIT-T15 cells or isolated mouse pancreatic islets to MeHg significantly increased ROS levels. MeHg could also suppress insulin secretion in HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. After 24 h of exposure to MeHg, HIT-T15 cells had a significant increase in mercury levels with a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, MeHg displayed several features of cell apoptosis including an increase of the sub-G1 population and annexin-V binding. Treatment of HIT-T15 cells with MeHg resulted in disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and activation of caspase-3. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine effectively reversed the MeHg-induced cellular responses. Altogether, our data clearly indicate that MeHg-induced oxidative stress causes pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and dysfunction.","output":"Methylmercury induces pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We evaluated the short- and long-term surgical outcomes of hepatectomy combined with diaphragmatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with diaphragmatic involvement. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of HCC patients with diaphragmatic resection (DR group) and HCC patients without diaphragmatic resection (non-DR group). We applied 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) to these subjects. RESULTS The study included 46 patients in DR group and 828 patients in non-DR group. The DR group cases were pathologically more advanced, and both overall and relapse-free survival among the patients in this group with pathological diaphragmatic invasion were similar to cases with pathological diaphragmatic fibrous adhesion. There were 40 patients from each group subjected to PSM. In these matched cohorts, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding perioperative outcomes, overall survival, and relapse-free survival. Multivariate analyses of our matched HCC patients revealed that alpha-fetoprotein expression and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and poor differentiation for relapse-free survival, whereas neither diaphragmatic invasion nor diaphragmatic resection were prognostic indicators. The most frequent site of recurrence in non-DR group was the liver, whereas the most frequent site of recurrence in DR group was the lung before and after PSM. CONCLUSIONS The short- and long-term surgical outcomes of DR HCC cases are equivalent to their non-DR counterparts under a matched clinicopathological background.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 21st 2020, with a peak number of infected individuals of about 26000 (not including recovered and dead) and a number of deaths at the end of the epidemics of about 18,000. Since the confirmed cases are believed to be between 10 and 20% of the real number of individuals who eventually get infected, the apparent mortality rate of COVID-19 falls between 4% and 8% in Italy, while it appears substantially lower, between 1% and 3% in China. Based on our calculations, we estimate that 2500 ventilation units should represent a fair figure for the peak requirement to be considered by health authorities in Italy for their strategic planning. Finally, a simulation of the effects of drastic containment measures on the outbreak in Italy indicates that a reduction of the infection rate indeed causes a quench of the epidemic peak. However, it is also seen that the infection rate needs to be cut down drastically and quickly to observe an appreciable decrease of the epidemic peak and mortality rate. This appears only possible through a concerted and disciplined, albeit painful, effort of the population as a whole.","output":"Analysis and forecast of COVID-19 spreading in China, Italy and France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastric volvulus is a rare condition defined as an abnormal stomach rotation around its axis, which usually presents in children under a year or in adults in their fifth decade.

METHOD We applied actor-partner multilevel models to repeated daily life assessments of physical intimacy (experienced and wished) and affect obtained six times a day over seven consecutive days from 120 older heterosexual German couples (Mage= 71.6, SDage= 5.94). Physiological stress was indexed as total daily cortisol output, the area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg). RESULTS Physical intimacy experienced and wished were reported at the vast majority of occasions, but to different degrees at different times. Within persons, in moments when participants experienced more physical intimacy, older women reported less negative affect, whereas older men reported more positive affect. Between persons, higher overall levels of physical intimacy experienced were associated with higher positive affect and less negative affect among women and with lower daily cortisol output among men. A stronger wish for intimacy was related to more negative affect among both women and men, and to higher daily cortisol output among men.

Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana. This study aims to analyze routine surveillance data to assess possible effects on the malaria burden in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Region of Ghana. Methods: Monthly routine data from the District Health Information Management System II (DHIMS2) of the Northern Region of Ghana were analyzed. Overall outpatient department visits and malaria incidence rates from the years 2015 to 2019 were compared to the corresponding data of the year 2020. Results: Compared to the corresponding periods of the years 2015 to 2019, overall visits and malaria incidence in pediatric and adult outpatient departments in northern Ghana decreased in March and April 2020, when major movement and social restrictions were implemented in response to the pandemic. Incidence slightly rebounded afterwards in 2020 but stayed below the average of the previous years. Data from inpatient departments showed a similar but more pronounced trend when compared to outpatient departments. In pregnant women, however, malaria incidence in outpatient departments increased after the first COVID-19 wave. Discussion: The findings from this study show that the COVID-19 pandemic affects the malaria burden in health facilities of Ghana, with declines in in- and outpatient rates. Pregnant women may experience reduced access to intermittent preventive malaria treatment and insecticide treated nets, resulting in subsequent higher malaria morbidity. Further data from other African countries, particularly on community-based studies, are needed to fully determine the impact of the pandemic on the malaria situation.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden in northern Ghana: Analysis of routine surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented consequences globally has spurred the interest of the artificial intelligence research community A plethora of published studies have investigated the role of imaging such as chest X-rays and computer tomography in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) automated diagnosis pen repositories of medical imaging data can play a significant role by promoting cooperation among institutes in a world-wide scale However, they may induce limitations related to variable data quality and intrinsic differences due to the wide variety of scanner vendors and imaging parameters In this study, a state-of-the-art custom U-Net model is presented with a dice similarity coefficient performance of 99 6% along with a transfer learning VGG-19 based model for COVID-19 versus pneumonia differentiation exhibiting an area under curve of 96 1% The above was significantly improved over the baseline model trained with no segmentation in selected tomographic slices of the same dataset The presented study highlights the importance of a robust preprocessing protocol for image analysis within a heterogeneous imaging dataset and assesses the potential diagnostic value of the presented COVID-19 model by comparing its performance to the state of the art","output":"Advancing COVID-19 differentiation with a robust preprocessing and integration of multi-institutional open-repository computer tomography datasets for deep learning analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To determine oncologic outcomes and predictors of primary efficacy, including RENAL nephrometry scores (radius, exophytic/endophytic properties, nearness of tumor to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, location relative to polar lines), after percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation of proven renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who underwent percutaneous computed tomography- and ultrasound-guided RF ablation for histologically proven RCC from 2004 to 2011 were evaluated. Clinical data, pathologic findings, technical details, and outcomes were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of primary technique effectiveness and complications. Local tumor progression-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival were calculated. One hundred RCC lesions underwent 115 RF ablation sessions in 84 patients. Median follow-up was 24 months (mean, 27 mo; range, 1-106 mo). RESULTS Efficacy of RF ablation was defined per International Working Group of Image-Guided Tumor Ablation criteria. Total, primary, and secondary technique effectiveness rates were 95% (95 of 100), 86% (86 of 100), and 9% (nine of 100), respectively. Primary efficacy was associated with size (P < .001), proximity to collecting system (P = .001), RENAL nephrometry score (P < .001), and number of ablation zones (P < .001). Complications occurred in 13% of patients, without procedure-related deaths. The median 2.1-year local progression-free, metastasis-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates were 86%, 98.7%, 100%, and 97.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous image-guided RF ablation for RCC provides excellent intermediate oncologic control.

Key to future therapeutic exploitation of this mechanism is thorough knowledge of the mechanisms driving trained immunity, which can be used as pharmacological targets. These mechanisms include profound changes in intracellular metabolism, which are closely intertwined with epigenetic reprogramming at the level of histone modifications. Glycolysis, glutamine replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with accumulation of fumarate, and the mevalonate pathway have all been identified as critical pathways for trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages.

One year into the pandemic, we aimed to test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19. Methods We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021 for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses. Results The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally, COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. Conclusions We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe.

This study first proposed that the TL1A/DR3 axis was significantly upregulated in patients and mice with both asthma and high TNF-a expression and in TNF-a-stimulated epithelial Beas-2B cells. Two independent approaches were used to demonstrate that the TL1A/DR3 axis of mice was strongly correlated with TNF-a in terms of exacerbating asthmatic epithelialCmesenchymal transformation (EMT). First, high expression levels of EMT proteins (e.g., collagen I, fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and TL1A/DR3 axis were observed when mice airways were stimulated by recombinant mouse TNF-a protein. Moreover, EMT protein and TL1A/DR3 axis expression synchronously decreased after mice with OVA-induced asthma were treated with infliximab by neutralizing TNF-a activity. Furthermore, the OVA-induced EMT of asthmatic mice was remarkably improved upon the deletion of the TL1A/DR3 axis by knocking out the TL1A gene. TL1A siRNA remarkably intervened EMT formation induced by TNF-a in the Beas-2B cells. In addition, EMT was induced by the addition of high concentrations of recombinant human sTL1A with the cell medium.

In addition to infectious and respiratory disease physicians, many doctors in other medical fields have been infected. Methods We prospectively collected epidemiological data on medical staff members who are working in neurosurgery departments in 107 hospitals in Hubei province through self-reported questionnaires or telephone interviews. Data of medical staff members with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were analysed. The final follow-up date was 1 March 2020. Findings A total of 5,442 neurosurgery department medical staff members were surveyed. One hundred and twenty cases, involving 54 doctors and 66 nurses, were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. The overall incidence was 2.2%. These cases were concentrated in 26 centres, 16 of which had admitted a total of 59 patients with COVID-19 complicated by craniocerebral disease. Medical staff members in centres receiving COVID-19 patients had a higher risk of contracting infection than those in centres not receiving COVID-19 patients (relative risk: 19.6; 95% confidence interval: 12.6-30.6). Contact with either COVID-19 patients (62.5%, 75/120) or infected colleagues (30.8%, 37/120) was the most common mode of transmission. About 78.3% (94/120) of the infected cases wore surgical masks, whereas 20.8% (25/120) failed to use protection when exposed to the source of infection. Severe infections were observed in 11.7% (14/120) of the cases, with one death (0.8%, 1/120). All the infected medical staff members had been discharged from the hospital. A total of 1,287 medical staff members were dispatched to participate in the frontline response to COVID-19 under level 2 protection of whom one was infected. Medical staff members who took inadequate protection had a higher risk of contracting infection than those using level 2 protection (relative risk: 36.9; 95% confidence interval: 5.2-263.6). Interpretation Neurosurgical staff members in Hubei province were seriously affected by COVID-19. Level 2 protection and strengthening of protective measures are likely to be effective in preventing medical workers from being infected.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in medical staff members of neurosurgery departments in Hubei province: A multicentre descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite the high volume of infections, some clinical aspects of this disease are still unknown. There are currently no studies in Colombia that describe the diseases clinical and treatment aspects in detail. OBJECTIVE: Describe the characteristics and clinical management of a group of admitted patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a private clinic in Montera, Crdoba-Colombia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive observational study was carried out between May and August 2020 in 209 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Upon admittance, clinical, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and complications were analyzed. Additionally, the effect of the following medications was described: 1antibiotics (cefepime, piperacillin, tazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin) + low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) + corticosteroids (dexamethasoneCmethylprednisolone) + colchicine. 2 Antibiotic + LMWH + corticosteroids. 3LMWH + corticosteroids. 4LMWH + corticosteroids + colchicine. 5Other treatments (Tocilizumab). RESULTS: 107 (51%) of the 209 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 passed away. The main comorbidities related to mortality of these hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were obesity and kidney disease (P < 0.05). The main complications associated with fatal outcomes in this group of patients were Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, it was evidenced that the colchicine combination showed a significant difference in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients compared to the other therapeutic regimens (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A mortality rate of 51% was found attributable to several factors such as advanced age, obesity, kidney disease, and an average time in days of late consultation. The implementation of the colchicine combination could reduce the mortality rate in this disease.","output":"Clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and evidence-based on the pharmacological management reduce mortality in a region of the Colombian Caribbean"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological manifestations may be common in COVID-19 patients.

This case series describes two adult patients admitted to the university hospital and positive to novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who developed drug-resistant status epilepticus. Both patients underwent early electroencephalography (EEG) assessment, which showed a pathological EEG pattern characterized by general slowing, rhythmic activity and continuous epileptic paroxysmal activity. A suspected autoimmune etiology, potentially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, encouraged a rapid work-up for a possible autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis. Therapeutic approach included the administration of 0.4 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in a complete resolution of seizures after 5 and after 10 days, respectively, without adverse effects and followed by a normalization of the EEG patterns.","output":"Intravenous immunoglobulin response in new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) COVID-19 adult patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Threshold concepts are attracting increasing attention as a framework for improving medical education practice.

The findings will be presented in the form of a descriptive numerical summary and a narrative synthesis. The review will provide a comprehensive overview of how the threshold concept framework is currently being utilised and applied, and provide recommendations for how medical educators can employ the framework in their own practice.

This adaptability is lost in cultured adult endothelial cells, which do not vascularize tissues in an organotypic manner. Here, we show that transient reactivation of the embryonic-restricted ETS variant transcription factor 2 (ETV2)(3) in mature human endothelial cells cultured in a serum-free three-dimensional matrix composed of a mixture of laminin, entactin and type-IV collagen (LEC matrix) resets these endothelial cells to adaptable, vasculogenic cells, which form perfusable and plastic vascular plexi. Through chromatin remodelling, ETV2 induces tubulogenic pathways, including the activation of RAP1, which promotes the formation of durable lumens(4,5). In three-dimensional matriceswhich do not have the constraints of bioprinted scaffoldsthe reset vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into stable, multilayered and branching vascular networks within scalable microfluidic chambers, which are capable of transporting human blood. In vivo, R-VECs implanted subcutaneously in mice self-organize into durable pericyte-coated vessels that functionally anastomose to the host circulation and exhibit long-lasting patterning, with no evidence of malformations or angiomas. R-VECs directly interact with cells within three-dimensional co-cultured organoids, removing the need for the restrictive synthetic semipermeable membranes that are required for organ-on-chip systems, therefore providing a physiological platform for vascularization, which we call Organ-On-VascularNet. R-VECs enable perfusion of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting human pancreatic islets, vascularize decellularized rat intestines and arborize healthy or cancerous human colon organoids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, we demonstrate that R-VECs establish an adaptive vascular niche that differentially adjusts and conforms to organoids and tumoroids in a tissue-specific manner. Our Organ-On-VascularNet model will permit metabolic, immunological and physiochemical studies and screens to decipher the crosstalk between organotypic endothelial cells and parenchymal cells for identification of determinants of endothelial cell heterogeneity, and could lead to advances in therapeutic organ repair and tumour targeting.","output":"Adaptable haemodynamic endothelial cells for organogenesis and tumorigenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To monitor population mental health, the identification of relevant indicators is pivotal. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of current indicators representing the various fields of public mental health core topics. It was conducted as a first step to build up a Mental Health Surveillance for Germany. Methods: We conducted a systematic MEDLINE search via PubMed. This search was supplemented by an extensive examination of the websites of relevant national as well as international institutions in the context of public mental health and an additional internet search via Google. To structure the data, an expert-based focus group identified superordinate topics most relevant to public mental health to which the identified indicators could be assigned to. Finally, the indicator set was screened for duplicates and appropriate content to arrive at a final set. Results: Within the various search strategies, we identified 13.811 records. Of these records, a total of 365 records were processed for indicator extraction. The extracted indicators were then assigned to 14 topics most relevant to public mental health as identified by the expert-based focus group. After the exclusion of duplicates and those indicators not meeting criteria of specificity and target group, the final set consisted of 192 indicators. Conclusion: The presented indicator set provides guidance in the field of current concepts in public mental health monitoring. As a comprehensive compilation, it may serve as basis for future surveillance efforts, which can be adjusted and condensed depending on the particular monitoring focus. Our work provides insights into established indicators included in former surveillance work as well as recent, not yet included indicators reflecting current developments in the field. Since our compilation mainly concludes indicators related to mental health in adults, it should be complemented with indicators specific to children and adolescents. Furthermore, our review revealed that indicators on mental health promotion and prevention are underrepresented in current literature of public mental health and should hence be focused on within future research and surveillance.","output":"Indicators for Public Mental Health: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I argue that expectations or strong beliefs about what can occur, and the imaginaries they construct, can be shaped by organizations and used by them as techniques for public legitimation of their governance and regulatory activities.

The expectations and imaginary flowing from the ICHs mission and framing, harmonisation for better health, support a focus on technological development for the production of safe, quality, and effective pharmaceuticals and individual ethical conduct to achieve it. The expectations also marginalize wider systemic issues relating to social justice, particularly those affecting the global South. The central role of scientific-technical knowledge and expertise to harmonization abets the latter by minimizing the value to governance of public knowledges on systemic issues. Instead of ensuring the contribution of these knowledges to governance through public participation, there is an attempt to bolster legitimation through communication of expectations and transparency to show practices are in accordance with them (ie expectations are met).","output":"Expectations as techniques of legitimation?

The timely diagnosis of infected patients is a critical step to limit the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The chest radiography imaging has shown to be an effective screening technique in diagnosing the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the pressure on radiologists and control of the epidemic, fast and accurate a hybrid deep learning framework for diagnosing COVID-19 virus in chest X-ray images is developed and termed as the COVID-CheXNet system. First, the contrast of the X-ray image was enhanced and the noise level was reduced using the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and Butterworth bandpass filter, respectively. This was followed by fusing the results obtained from two different pre-trained deep learning models based on the incorporation of a ResNet34 and high-resolution network model trained using a large-scale dataset. Herein, the parallel architecture was considered, which provides radiologists with a high degree of confidence to discriminate between the healthy and COVID-19 infected people.

Infection with this highly dangerous human-infecting coronavirus via inhalation of respiratory droplets from SARS-CoV-2 carriers results in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which features clinical symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and life-threatening pneumonia. Several COVID-19 waves arose in Taiwan from January 2020 to March 2021, with the largest outbreak ever having a high case fatality rate (CFR) (5.95%) between May and June 2021. In this study, we identified five 20I (alpha, V1)/B.1.1.7/GR SARS-CoV-2 (KMUH-3 to 7) lineage viruses from COVID-19 patients in this largest COVID-19 outbreak. Sequence placement analysis using the existing SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree revealed that KMUH-3 originated from Japan and that KMUH-4 to KMUH-7 possibly originated via local transmission. Spike mutations M1237I and D614G were identified in KMUH-4 to KMUH-7 as well as in 43 other alpha/B.1.1.7 sequences of 48 alpha/B.1.1.7 sequences deposited in GISAID derived from clinical samples collected in Taiwan between 20 April and July. However, M1237I mutation was not observed in the other 12 alpha/B.1.1.7 sequences collected between 26 December 2020, and 12 April 2021. We conclude that the largest COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan between May and June 2021 was initially caused by the alpha/B.1.1.7 variant harboring spike D614G + M1237I mutations, which was introduced to Taiwan by China Airlines cargo crew members. To our knowledge, this is the first documented COVID-19 outbreak caused by alpha/B.1.1.7 variant harboring spike M1237I mutation thus far. The largest COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan resulted in 13,795 cases and 820 deaths, with a high CFR, at 5.95%, accounting for 80.90% of all cases and 96.47% of all deaths during the first 2 years. The high CFR caused by SARS-CoV-2 alpha variants in Taiwan can be attributable to comorbidities and low herd immunity. We also suggest that timely SARS-CoV-2 isolation and/or sequencing are of importance in real-time epidemiological investigations and in epidemic prevention. The impact of G614G + M1237I mutations in the spike gene on the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading as well as on high CFR remains to be elucidated.","output":"Identification and Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha Variants in the Largest Taiwan COVID-19 Outbreak in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selecting a suitable method to solve a black-box optimization problem that uses noisy data was considered. A targeted stop condition for the function to be optimized, implemented as a stochastic algorithm, makes established Bayesian methods inadmissible. A simple modification was proposed and shown to improve optimization the efficiency considerably. The optimization effectiveness was measured in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the number of function evaluations required to achieve the target. Comparisons with alternative methods showed that the modified Bayesian method and binary search were both performant, but in different ways. In a sequence of identical runs, the former had a lower expected value for the number of runs needed to find an optimal value. The latter had a lower standard deviation for the same sequence of runs.

In developing nations, smaller hospitals were unprepared to face this outbreak nor had strategies in place to do so at the beginning. Here, we describe the preparation in an anesthetic department using simulation-based training over two weeks, as the number of cases rose rapidly. METHODS: Three areas of priority were identified - staff safety, patient movement and possible clinical scenarios based on simulation principles in healthcare education. Staff was rostered and rotated through stations for rapid cycle-deliberate practice to learn donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR). For difficult airway management, Peyton's 4-steps for skills training and Harden's Three Circle model formed the structure in teaching the core skills. Several clinical scenarios used system probing to elicit inadequacies followed by formal debriefing to facilitate reflection. Finally, evaluation was both immediate and delayed with an online survey after one month to examine four levels of reaction, learning, behavior and impact based on the Kirkpatrick Model. Frequency and thematic analysis were then conducted on the quantitative and qualitative data respectively. RESULTS: 15 out of 16 (93%) consultants, 16 (100%) specialists and 81 (100%) medical officers in the department completed training within two consecutive weeks. Reaction and part of the learning were relayed immediately to trainers during training. Forty-two (39%) trained staff responded to the survey. All were satisfied and agreed on the relevance of training. Forty-one respondents (98%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 87%-99%) answered 16 out of 20 questions correctly on identifying aerosol generating procedures (AGP), indications for PPE, planning and preparation for airway management to achieve adequate learning. 43% (95% CI, 27%-59%) and 52% (95% CI 36%-68%) recalled donning and doffing steps correctly. Ninety-two responses from 33 respondents were analyzed in the thematic analysis. All respondents reported at least 1 behavioral change in intended outcomes for hand hygiene practice (20%), appropriate use of PPE (27%), and airway management (10%). The emerging outcomes were vigilance, physical distancing, planning and team communication. Lastly, the impact of training led to the establishment of institutional guidelines followed by all personnel.

Recent research has demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of some Bcl-2 protein family members can modulate apoptosis; however, the transmembrane interactome of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the Mcl-1 TMD forms homooligomers in the mitochondrial membrane, competes with full-length Mcl-1 protein with regards to its antiapoptotic function, and induces cell death in a Bok-dependent manner. While the Bok TMD oligomers locate preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), heterooligomerization between the TMDs of Mcl-1 and Bok predominantly takes place at the mitochondrial membrane. Strikingly, the coexpression of Mcl-1 and Bok TMDs produces an increase in ER mitochondrial-associated membranes, suggesting an active role of Mcl-1 in the induced mitochondrial targeting of Bok.
