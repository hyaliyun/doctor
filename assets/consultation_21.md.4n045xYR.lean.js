Therefore, wearing eyeglasses more than 8 hours per day may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly because eyeglasses are a barrier that reduces the frequency with which people touch their eyes. The aim of the study was to determine if eyeglasses protect from COVID-19 infection.

RESULTS Eyewear was associated with a reduced risk of infection, odds ratio (OR)=0.77. The effects of sex, age, and eyewear were independent and significant at the 95% level. Men are 1.24-times more likely to be infected than women; subjects' risk of infection is less (0.95) for every year of age.

The typical class of DAEC includes E. coli strains harboring AfaE-I, AfaE-II, AfaE-III, AfaE-V, Dr, Dr-II, F1845, and NFA-I adhesins (Afa/Dr DAEC); these strains (i) have an identical genetic organization and (ii) allow binding to human decay-accelerating factor (DAF) (Afa/Dr(DAF) subclass) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (Afa/Dr(CEA) subclass). The atypical class of DAEC includes two subclasses of strains; the atypical subclass 1 includes E. coli strains that express AfaE-VII, AfaE-VIII, AAF-I, AAF-II, and AAF-III adhesins, which (i) have an identical genetic organization and (ii) do not bind to human DAF, and the atypical subclass 2 includes E. coli strains that harbor Afa/Dr adhesins or others adhesins promoting diffuse adhesion, together with pathogenicity islands such as the LEE pathogenicity island (DA-EPEC). In this review, the focus is on Afa/Dr DAEC strains that have been found to be associated with urinary tract infections and with enteric infection. The review aims to provide a broad overview and update of the virulence aspects of these intriguing pathogens. Epidemiological studies, diagnostic techniques, characteristic molecular features of Afa/Dr operons, and the respective role of Afa/Dr adhesins and invasins in pathogenesis are described. Following the recognition of membrane-bound receptors, including type IV collagen, DAF, CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6, by Afa/Dr adhesins, activation of signal transduction pathways leads to structural and functional injuries at brush border and junctional domains and to proinflammatory responses in polarized intestinal cells. In addition, uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC strains, following recognition of beta(1) integrin as a receptor, enter epithelial cells by a zipper-like, raft- and microtubule-dependent mechanism. Finally, the presence of other, unknown virulence factors and the way that an Afa/Dr DAEC strain emerges from the human intestinal microbiota as a \\"silent pathogen\\" are discussed.","output":"Pathogenesis of Afa/Dr diffusely adhering Escherichia coli."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 400 000 people globally.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications.

For instance, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) protects nerve cells from noxious stimuli in vitro and in vivo. Recent reports link PUFA supplementation to improving painful diabetic neuropathy (pDN) symptoms, but cellular mechanisms responsible for this therapeutic effect are not well understood. The objective of this study is to identify distinct cellular pathways elicited by dietary omega-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affected by pDN. Methods: Forty volunteers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the En Balance-PLUS diabetes education study. The volunteers participated in weekly lifestyle/nutrition education and daily supplementation with 1000 mg DHA and 200 mg eicosapentaenoic acid. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire validated clinical determination of baseline and post-intervention pain complaints. Laboratory and untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted using blood plasma collected at baseline and after three months of participation in the dietary regimen. The metabolomics data were analyzed using random forest, hierarchical clustering, ingenuity pathway analysis, and metabolic pathway mapping. Results: The data show that metabolites involved in oxidative stress and glutathione production shifted significantly to a more anti-inflammatory state post supplementation. Example of these metabolites include cystathionine (+90%), S-methylmethionine (+9%), glycine cysteine-glutathione disulfide (+157%) cysteinylglycine (+19%), glutamate (?11%), glycine (+11%), and arginine (+13.4%). In addition, the levels of phospholipids associated with improved membrane fluidity such as linoleoyl-docosahexaenoyl-glycerol (18:2/22:6) (+253%) were significantly increased. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggested several key bio functions associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation such as formation of reactive oxygen species (p = 4.38  10(?4), z-score = ?1.96), peroxidation of lipids (p = 2.24  10(?5), z-score = ?1.944), Ca(2+) transport (p = 1.55  10(?4), z-score = ?1.969), excitation of neurons (p = 1.07 10(?4), z-score = ?1.091), and concentration of glutathione (p = 3.06  10(?4), z-score = 1.974).

Both treatments blocked virus infection and apoptosis, indicating that virusCreceptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for the apoptosis induction. Furthermore, virus infection significantly increased the formation of the deathCreceptor complexes consisting of Fas, Fas-associated death domain and procaspase-8, but did not induce the complexes involving the tumor necrosis factor receptor and its associated death domain, demonstrating the specific activation of the Fas signaling pathway.

Early challenges in the 2020 deployed environment included limited availability of living and quarantine space and limited testing capacity. This is a brief report of stringent quarantine strategies employed to newly arriving cohorts at a NATO and U.S. military base to prevent release of SARS-CoV-2 into a larger base population. METHODS: With awareness of the worldwide pandemic, beginning in late February 2020, all personnel arriving to the Hamid Karzai International Airport NATO base were quarantined for 14 days to prevent interaction with the wider base population. Testing capacity was limited. Names, locations, and dates of those within quarantine were tracked to improve contact tracing. Between February and April 2020, the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed on a military base in Afghanistan within quarantine. RESULTS: Within quarantine, 11 males became PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 during April 2020. Five of the 11 were PCR tested for symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of taste. A sixth individual, who had been asymptomatic upon leaving the base after completion of quarantine, later developed symptoms and tested positive. Another five asymptomatic individuals were found with antibody testing just before planned release from 14 days of quarantine post-exposure and confirmed with PCR testing. All PCR-positive individuals were diagnosed before being released into the general population of the base because of strict screening, quarantine, and exit criteria. CONCLUSION: Quarantine creates significant strain on resources in a deployed environment. Group quarantine facilities where social distancing is limited allow for the possibility for intra-quarantine transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, PCR testing is done upon entry into quarantine and upon exit. With the possibility of false-negative PCR or limited PCR testing, we recommend daily symptom screening, pulse oximetry, temperature checks, and small quarantine groups that must graduate togetherall meeting exit criteria. Any introduction of new individual, even with negative testing, to a group increases risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Upon exit of quarantine, testing should be performed, regardless of entry testing. If PCR is limited, serology testing should be done, followed by PCR, if positive. Serology testing can be combined with clinical judgment to conserve PCR testing for quarantine release of asymptomatic individuals.","output":"Mitigating SARS-CoV-2 in the Deployed Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is the fact, and the way it is perceived.

The comparison of this model in $t^m$ with two known models having the same number of parameters, well shows that its representativity of the real data is better or more general.

However, adoption of COVID-19-related preventive behaviours remain relatively unknown. This study investigated predictors of preventive behaviours. METHODS: An analytical sample of 897 Singaporean adults who were quota sampled based on age, gender, and ethnicity were recruited through a web-enabled survey. Outcomes were adoption of, or increased frequency of preventive behaviours (avoiding social events; avoiding public transport; reducing time spent shopping and eating out; wearing a mask in public; avoiding hospitals/clinics; keeping children out of school, washing hands/using sanitisers; keeping surroundings clean; avoiding touching public surfaces; working from/studying at home). Public perceptions regarding COVID-19 (chances of getting COVID-19; perceived likelihood of COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission; government trust; self-efficacy; perceived appropriateness of COVID-19 behaviours; response efficacy), anxiety, and demographic characteristics (age; ethnicity; marital status; education; chronic conditions; current living arrangements) were investigated as predictors of preventive behaviours adopted during COVID-19 in binomial and ordered logistic regressions. RESULTS: Though adoption of preventive behaviours among Singaporeans varied, it was, overall, high, and consistent with government recommendations. Nearly a quarter reported moderate to severe anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item - GAD-7 scores). Respondents who perceived higher COVID-19 risks, had higher government trust, higher self-efficacy, and perceived that others acted appropriately reported increased adoption/frequency of preventive measures. The strongest indicator of behavioural change was response efficacy. Respondents who were older, highly educated, anxious and married reported higher adoption/frequency of preventive measures. CONCLUSION: To successfully influence appropriate preventive behaviours, public health messages should highlight response efficacy, increase self-efficacy, and promote trust in governmental response. Focus should be on demographic segments with low adoptions, such as younger individuals and those with low education.","output":"Adoption of Preventive Behaviour Strategies and Public Perceptions About COVID-19 in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Post-COVID syndrome can impact against every sphere of daily live. The objective of this work was to detect the factors correlated with a better or worse physical recovery four months after hospital discharge from a hospitalization in ICU due to COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective descriptive study of 125 patients valued by the Rehabilitation Service during hospitalization in ICU, from March 12th to December 31st, 2020. Data from 76 patients was analysed with clinical follow up after 1, 2 and 4 months of hospital discharge. Variables on personal, hospitalary, functional symptoms/signals and physical recovery were analysed with mean +/- standard deviation, counting (percentage), T-student test and Fisher test. RESULTS: After one month, fatigue was observed in 60 (80%) patients and dyspnoea in 47 (62%). After two months, fatigue in 37 (55%), dyspnoea in 25 (33%), shoulder pain in 33 (43%), average QuickDASH was 22.7 (11.3-50), Sit-to-Stand Test in 30 seconds 11.5 (10-13) and 6-minute walk test 390 meters (326-445). In the fourth month, 25 (53%) had returned to work and had an average of the physical recovery of 79.1%+/-18.3%. There was no correlation between physical recovery >=75% and the first month data, but there certainly was a correlation between some second month variables, such as fatigue (p=0.001), dyspnoea (p=0.035), QuickDASH (p=0.001) and 6-minute walk test (p=0.021).

This includes conflict-induced, cross-border travel for medical treatment. Yet the conceptual approach to this healthcare-seeking behaviour, by a population here referred to as cross-border population, remains poorly understood. This scoping review identifies academic literature on cross-border populations to map the current approach to cross-border populations and to propose a research agenda. METHODS: The study used a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review methodology. We included articles on conflicts between 1980 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 53 articles met the inclusion criteria. From these articles, we distinguished four types of studies on cross-border healthcare: Direct analysis, implicit analysis, clinical research, and identification. The 45 articles belonging to the first three categories were then searched for themes specifically relevant to healthcare for cross-border populations and linked with sub-themes such as border crossing time and the types of healthcare available. These themes were structured into three main areas: access to care; quality of care; and governance of care. Our analysis then describes the available knowledge, documented practices, and challenges of cross-border healthcare specifically in conflict settings. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of cross-border healthcare systems is required to inform local practices and develop related regional and international policies. While the reviewed literature provides some highlights on various practices of cross-border healthcare, there are many gaps in available knowledge of this topic. To address these gaps, our study proposes a research framework outlining key themes and research questions to be investigated by signposting where major research and operational gaps remain. This facilitates well-directed future work on cross-border therapeutic geographies in the context of armed conflict and furthers understanding of a hitherto largely ignored area of the international healthcare system.","output":"Cross-border strategies for access to healthcare in violent conflict C A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to illuminate participants experiences with transfer in (1) Illness Management and Recovery (IMR); and (2) two programs based on peer support: Turning Points, and Learn to Tackle Anxiety and Depression (LTAD); and whether peer support within these programs influenced the process of transfer beyond the interventional context. Furthermore, we investigated participants experiences with a community-based intervention [Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] to explore perspectives on mechanisms that may eliminate challenges in the transfer process. METHODS: The study was based on semi-structured interviews with participants with mental illness, from four different psychosocial interventions with and without peer support and across interventional settings. The material partly consists of secondary analyses of existing data sets of anonymised, transcribed interviews investigating participants' experience from two psychosocial interventions: Illness Management and Recovery (n = 15), and Individual Placement and Support (n = 12). Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with persons who had participated in one of two peer-led programs: Turning Points and Learn How to Tackle Anxiety and Depression (n = 12). The analysis was guided by a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach to illuminate transfer processes and was based on the template method described by Nigel King. RESULTS: Applying a transfer perspective on rehabilitation interventions identified everyday life situations where capacities learned during the interventions were utilized and conditions were highlighted that promoted or hindered transfer. Experiential knowledge and peer-exchange made transferal pathways between the interventional context and everyday life. Illness intrusiveness and uncertainty, together with environmental obstacles, generated transferal gaps. Individualized support could partly address these gaps. CONCLUSION: Findings from this qualitative study illuminate how peer-support in group-based rehabilitation interventions increased social functioning and developed better self-care strategies that can be transferred to daily life. Interventions situated in mental health settings, e.g. outpatient clinics, had limited impact on participation in broader community life. Advancing rehabilitation services in mental health may benefit from tailoring services to address illness fluctuation and combining group sessions with individualized support together with acknowledging and overcoming environmental obstacles.","output":"The missing link-participants perspectives on transfer from psychosocial interventional contexts to everyday community life: a qualitative synthesis of interventional studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There may not be better way by which one can instantly capture the quintessence of the 81-page Proposal for a Digital Markets Act tabled by the European Commission in December 2020 as when one reads a few lines placed in the middle of Recital 58: The gatekeepers should ensure the compliance with this Regulation by design. The necessary measures should therefore be as much as possible and where relevant integrated into the technological design used by the gatekeepers.

This does not exclude, however, that a further specification of the concrete measures might be necessary in the framework of a regulatory dialogue, with the purpose to facilitate compliance by gatekeepers and expedite the correct implementation of the Regulation. The Paper offers some preliminary and cautious reflections specifically on the data-related obligations for gatekeepers that the DMA would introduce. First, it will be shown that the breadth and depth of the proposed data-related obligations reflect an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the extensive data governance/regulatory plumbing necessary to ensure open and fair markets in the digital sector. Second, it is important to underline how the asymmetrical data governance for gatekeepers that the DMA would introduce builds on and enhances important pieces of the EU data acquis. Finally, the extent to which the DMA ties in with the European Commissions overall data strategy is also worth investigating.

Thus, the outbreak has forced HPSs to adapt their outpatient consultation services to Telepharmacy to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of contagion. The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze the experience of HPSs with outpatient Telepharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and expose the lessons learned. Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","output":"Pharmaceutical care to hospital outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We analyzed the role of their pulmonary images in predicting the severity and diagnosis of the disease. METHODS: Among 97 patients with confirmed novel H1N1 infection, 42 patients treated with mechanical ventilation formed group 1, and the remaining 55 patients constituted group 2. The initial and subsequent radiograhic findings in groups 1 and 2 were compared with respect to the pattern, distribution, and extent of the abnormality. RESULTS: In group 1, 24 patients presented with three or more lung zone diseases, whereas only 5 patients in group 2 demonstrated these findings (P<0.001).

We sought to examine developmental plasticity and adult acclimation in response to hypoxia of aerobic capacity (V?O(2max)) for thermogenesis in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude. Deer mice were bred in captivity and exposed to normoxia or one of four hypoxia treatments (12 kPa O(2)) across life stages: adult hypoxia (6C8 weeks), post-natal hypoxia (birth to adulthood), life-long hypoxia (before conception to adulthood), and parental hypoxia (mice conceived and raised in normoxia, but parents previously exposed to hypoxia). Hypoxia during perinatal development increased V?O(2max) by a much greater magnitude than adult hypoxia. The amplified effect of developmental hypoxia resulted from physiological plasticity that did not occur with adult hypoxia C namely, increases in lung ventilation and volume. Evolved characteristics of deer mice enabled developmental plasticity, because white-footed mice (P. leucopus; a congener restricted to low altitudes) could not raise pups in hypoxia. Parental hypoxia had no persistent effects on V?O(2max).

This study analyzed health care resource use (HCRU) and costs in patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 and aimed to estimate the one-year direct medical cost of the disease in Turkey. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between March and July 2020 in a tertiary hospital (n = 1056) in Istanbul. Patient demographics, clinical and treatment characteristics at admission, comorbidities, disease severity, and costs from a payer perspective were evaluated using the microcosting method. The results include LOS, hospital costs, and univariate and generalized linear models to investigate influencing factors. The data were extrapolated to provide a country-level estimate. RESULTS: The mean length of stay was 9.1 days (SD 6.9). The mean length of stay was 8.0 days (4.7) for patients hospitalized in wards versus 14.8 days (SD 12.0) for patients hospitalized in the ICU. In univariate analysis, several factors, including O(2) therapy (+ 3.7 days), high CRP > 41.8 mg/L (+ 3.8 days), and elevated ferritin (+ 3.5), were found to be associated with a longer LOS (p < 0.05).

The social context predicts the intensity of sexual selection due to its effect on mate choice and intra-sexual competition. Moreover, it exacerbates the costs derived from sexual conflict and allows for the existence of alternative reproductive tactics to counteract such costs. However, these mechanisms are still underexplored in many animal taxa. Majoidea \\"spider crabs\\" show a diversity of life history, and behavioral and morphological adaptations for reproduction, which have evolved as an outcome of competition to maximize reproductive success. We aimed to analyze in this study, male reproductive strategies through mating behavior under different social contexts, density of individuals, and males size differences in two species of \\"spider crabs\\", Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa. The experiments were as follows: one female and one male per aquarium (Experiment 1); a female and three males of similar sizes per aquarium (Experiment 2); and a female and three males of distinct sizes per aquarium (Experiment 3). The experiments showed that mating behavior and duration of mate guarding differ between species and among different social contexts. The presence of males with similar or different sizes showed a relevant different behavior, the female copulated with more than one male when males were similar in size (E2), and copulated only with the largest male when males were different in size (E3). In mate guarding, the shape and the use of the chelipeds had an important role: the male of Leurocyclus tuberculosus grasped the female with the chelipeds and did not fight with other males, but the male of Libinia spinosa surrounded the female with the chelipeds and fought with other males. The longest duration of mate guarding was during precopulatory guarding. Precopulatory guarding was present in all the experiments and its duration did not present significant differences among the experiments. However, in both species, the experiments differ in the duration of postcopulatory guarding until spawning. Gonopod morphology revealed important differences between species and are probably associated with sperm competition. The experiments under distinct social contexts linked to the use and shape of the chelipeds and the morphology of the gonopods, could allow to understand the functional significance of the different reproductive strategies.","output":"Male reproductive strategies in two species of spider crabs, Leurocyclus tuberculosus and Libinia spinosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Lotus like materials having superhydrophobicity is attaining greater demand due to the possibility of molding them into different high end applications.

However, researchers have used a plethora of monetary valuation methods to measure social value on an equally diverse set of events. Rather than being applied to major sport events, the use of these methods in sport research has been limited to smaller events, programs, or facilities. Consequently, investigating monetary valuation methods for major sport events is necessary to inform practitioners and researchers of these types of events as to which tool(s) to use. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate various monetary valuation methods to determine which method(s) is(are) best to examine residents' social value in a post-event context and test the selected method(s) for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. After reviewing monetary valuation methods found in the sport management literature, two methods were deemed suitable avenues to pursue: the reverse contingent valuation method and the opportunity cost approach. This study employed an exploratory sequential mixed methods design to derive a conceptual and empirical analysis. Interviews were conducted with 14 Vancouver residents and supplemented with document analysis; as well, 525 Vancouver residents completed a self-administered online survey. Findings highlighted the importance of using both the reverse contingent valuation method and opportunity cost approach given their complementary nature. The reverse contingent valuation method allowed residents to select how much they valued their experience. This individual or micro-economic perspective is a necessary prerequisite for residents to adequately determine their value of hosting in relation to other options (e.g., building hospitals, having professional sport teams) when applying the opportunity cost approach, which asks residents to reflect at societal or macro-economic level. This synergistic approach demonstrates the importance of addressing both perspectives: the micro (i.e., individual exchange) and the macro (i.e., event exchange) aspect. In doing so, this approach offers researchers and practitioners avenues forward to examine the social value of publicly-funded major sport events exclusively through a direct, an indirect, and a synergistic method to advance the examination of major sport events' social value.","output":"Examining Monetary Valuation Methods to Analyze Residents' Social Value From Hosting a Publicly-Funded Major Sport Event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitrofurantoin is a cause of drug-induced pneumonitis and can result in clinically significant respiratory symptoms manifesting as interstitial lung disease on chest CT, even if the patient has been taking the drug chronically without side-effects https://bit.ly/3v2m29h","output":"Acute pulmonary function decline and radiographic abnormalities: chronic cause?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interoceptors, sensory neurons that monitor internal organs and states, are essential for physiological homeostasis and generating internal perceptions.

The proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points. Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19 cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress. Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021 data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19. We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly: COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19 cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with pandemic related period t mental distress.","output":"Associational and plausible causal effects of COVID-19 public health policies on economic and mental distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reality shifting (RS) is a trendy mental activity that emerged abruptly following the flare-up of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and seems to be practiced mainly by members of the post-millennial generation. RS, described as the experience of being able to transcend ones physical confines and visit alternate, mostly fictional, universes, is discussed by many on Internet platforms. One RS forum boasts over 40,000 members and RS clips on some social media platforms have been viewed over 1.7 billion times. The experience of shifting is reportedly facilitated by specific induction methods involving relaxation, concentration of attention, and autosuggestion. Some practitioners report a strong sense of presence in their desired realities, reified by some who believe in the concrete reality of the alternate world they shift to. One of the most popular alternate universes involves environments adopted from the Harry Potter book and film series. We describe the phenomenology of RS as reported online and then compare it to related phenomena such as hypnosis, tulpamancy, dissociation, immersive and maladaptive daydreaming, and lucid dreaming.

There is an increase in the number of stores to supply due to the quarantine. As a result, its high costs have been negatively affected. Therefore, the project focuses on minimizing the distances travelled in delivering its products, which will reduce costs. From applying vehicle routing with capacity (CVRP), a redesign of delivery routes is carried out weekly, proposing a new weekly delivery schedule of 22 routes and 162 destinations. Whit the CVRP application decreased 23.61% in the distance travelled even with an 8% increase in recipients. Thus, it reflects the fulfilment of the delivery objective to the current stores and those added by the warehouse. The research addresses two problems, first the costs incurred by the warehouse for the delivery of its products. The second is the increase in supply due to the initiative to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, avoid the displacement of long distances to purchase products by the inhabitants and reduce those who attend the stores' Warehouse supplies.","output":"Program for the Delivery of Basic Necessities of a Warehouse during the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In 819% of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with anticoagulant therapy (ACT), hemorrhagic complications occur, including due to excess doses of AC. At the same time, ACT is necessary for patients with AF, since anticoagulants effectively reduces the risk of ischemic stroke. To make a decision on the appointment of ACT, it is necessary to correlate the risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding, this requires knowledge of current clinical using ACT recommendations and instructions. Among patients admitted to hospital, 30% receive ACT, so increasing adherence to clinical recommendations for prescribing AC to patients with AF by doctors of various profiles is an urgent task. AIM To analyze the adherence of physicians to recommendations for prescribing ACT before and after the introduction of decision support system (DSS) in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-center non-randomized study with historical control to assess adherence to recommendations based on the analysis of medical prescriptions and the structure of drug errors in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital in Moscow before and after the introduction of DSS. Compliance with the recommendations of physicians was evaluated in the sections indications /contraindications to AC and dosage regimen of AC. The presence of deviations from the clinical recommendations /instructions for medical use of AC was regarded as management of the patient with non-compliance with recommendations. Physicians adherence level to recommendations was calculated as the ratio of cases of compliance with recommendations to the total number of cases. RESULTS In the control and experimental groups, there was a significant increase in the proportion of POAC at discharge in comparison with admission to hospital: from 54.5 to 76.8% (p=0.0005) and from 63 to 85.7% (p=0.0002), respectively. However, only in the experimental group it was possible to significantly reduce the number of patients without a prescribed ACT (if there are indications) from 7.6 to 1% (p=0.04) in comparison with admission. During the study, it was possible to significantly increase physicians adherence level to the recommendations for the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF from 59% (44 discrepancies for 107 prescriptions) to 84.6% (16 discrepancies for 104 prescriptions); p0.005. Before the introduction of the DSS, the analysis of drug prescriptions revealed 56 drug errors (0.5 errors per patient), after the introduction of the DSS, the number of drug errors significantly decreased to 21 (0.2 errors per patient); p0.05. After the introduction of DSS, the number of sub-therapeutic doses of AC was reduced from 31 (27.7%) to 8 (7.6%); p0.05. CONCLUSION The level of adherence to the recommendations for prescribing ACT to patients with AF in the hospital is high. The use of DSS increases the level of adherence to the recommendations on the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF, as well as eliminates errors in calculating the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications, and contributes to reducing the frequency of prescribing sub-therapeutic doses of AC.","output":"[Results of decision support system implementation for prescribing anticoagulants to patients with atrial fibrillation in hospital]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Favipiravir is considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 due its efficacy against different viral infections. We aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 mild and moderate cases.

In Study 1, PVD was positively associated with stronger reactions to the threat of COVID-19, including increased anxiety, perceptions that people should alter their typical behavior, as well as reported importance of engaging in proactive and social distancing behaviors. In Study 2, PVD was again associated with increased anxiety, as well as more vigilant behavior when grocery shopping, fewer trips to the store, and fewer face-to-face interactions. These associations remained significant when controlling for the Big-5 personality traits.

Although the deficits in overall ToM in epilepsy have been documented well, the effects of epilepsy on empathic ability and specific subcomponents of ToM remain unclear. The primary aim of this study was to provide the first meta-analytic integration of ToM and empathy in adult patients with epilepsy, and to decompose these constructs to clearly differentiate their distinct (cognitive ToM and affective empathy) and overlapping (affective ToM/cognitive empathy) components. This meta-analysis included 28 studies. Adult patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) showed impairments in cognitive ToM and affective ToM/cognitive empathy compared to the healthy controls (HCs); no group differences were identified for affective empathy. Besides, cognitive ToM was impaired in adult patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and focal seizures (caused by epileptogenic foci) outside the temporal and frontal lobes (extra-TLE/FLE) and no group differences were evident for affective ToM/cognitive empathy compared to the HCs. Moreover, relative to the HCs, no group differences were identified for affective empathy in adult patients with IGE. Additionally, no (statistically) significant difference was observed between the magnitude of ToM/empathy impairment in adult patients who underwent and those who did not undergo epilepsy surgery. These quantitative findings suggest differential impairment of the core aspects of social cognitive processing in adult patients with epilepsy, which may contribute to the development of structured cognitive interventions (i.e., social cognitive training) for adult patients with epilepsy.","output":"Theory of Mind and Empathy in Adults With Epilepsy: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance the incorporation of amino acids at stop codons and can thus bypass premature termination during protein synthesis. The polymerase (Pol) proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) are synthesized as a large GagCPol fusion protein, formed by the readthrough of a stop codon at the end of the gag ORF. The downstream pol ORF lacks its own start codon, and Pol protein synthesis is wholly dependent on translation of the upstream gag gene and the readthrough event for expression. Here, we explored the effects of readthrough-promoting drugs C aminoglycoside antibiotics and the small molecule ataluren C on the efficiency of readthrough of the stop codon in the context of the MoMLV genome. We showed that these compounds increased readthrough of the stop codon at the MoMLV gagCpol junction in vivo above the already high basal level and that the resulting elevated gagCpol readthrough had deleterious effects on virus replication. We also showed that readthrough efficiency could be driven to even higher levels in vitro, and that the combination of the small molecules and the RNA structure at the MoMLV stop codon could achieve extremely high readthrough efficiencies.","output":"Translational readthrough-promoting drugs enhance pseudoknot-mediated suppression of the stop codon at the Moloney murine leukemia virus gagCpol junction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 variants rapid spread and substantially increased resistance to neutralization by vaccinee and convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies with potent neutralization are eagerly sought.

METHODS: The Dutch Covid-19 and Perinatal Experiences (COPE-NL) study included 681 parents of infants between 0 and 6 months (572 mothers and 109 fathers). Parents filled out online questionnaires about Covid-19 related stress, mental health (i.e. anxiety and depressive symptoms), and insensitive parenting. Hierarchical regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Parents of a young infant reported high rates of Covid-19 related stress, with higher reported stress in mothers compared to fathers.

OBJECTIVE: Our study goal was to develop an NLP pipeline to classify the discharge disposition (home, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing inpatient facility [SNIF], and death) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 based on hospital discharge summary notes. METHODS: Text mining and feature engineering were applied to unstructured text from hospital discharge summaries. The study included patients with COVID-19 discharged from 2 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Womens Hospital) between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The data were divided into a training set (70%) and hold-out test set (30%). Discharge summaries were represented as bags-of-words consisting of single words (unigrams), bigrams, and trigrams. The number of features was reduced during training by excluding n-grams that occurred in fewer than 10% of discharge summaries, and further reduced using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization while training a multiclass logistic regression model. Model performance was evaluated using the hold-out test set. RESULTS: The study cohort included 1737 adult patients (median age 61 [SD 18] years; 55% men; 45% White and 16% Black; 14% nonsurvivors and 61% discharged home). The model selected 179 from a vocabulary of 1056 engineered features, consisting of combinations of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The top features contributing most to the classification by the model (for each outcome) were the following: appointments specialty, home health, and home care (home); intubate and ARDS (inpatient rehabilitation); service (SNIF); brief assessment and covid (death). The model achieved a micro-average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.98) and average precision of 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) in the testing set for prediction of discharge disposition. CONCLUSIONS: A supervised learningCbased NLP approach is able to classify the discharge disposition of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This approach has the potential to accelerate and increase the scale of research on patients discharge disposition that is possible with EHR data.","output":"Classification of the Disposition of Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: Reading Discharge Summaries Using Natural Language Processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world. It also created a need for the urgent development of efficacious predictive diagnostics, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to medical imaging. This has led to the convergence of experts from multiple disciplines to solve this global pandemic including clinicians, medical physicists, imaging scientists, computer scientists, and informatics experts to bring to bear the best of these fields for solving the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such a convergence over a very brief period of time has had unintended consequences and created its own challenges. As part of Medical Imaging Data and Resource Center initiative, we discuss the lessons learned from career transitions across the three involved disciplines (radiology, medical imaging physics, and computer science) and draw recommendations based on these experiences by analyzing the challenges associated with each of the three associated transition types: (1) AI of non-imaging data to AI of medical imaging data, (2) medical imaging clinician to AI of medical imaging, and (3) AI of medical imaging to AI of COVID-19 imaging. The lessons learned from these career transitions and the diffusion of knowledge among them could be accomplished more effectively by recognizing their associated intricacies. These lessons learned in the transitioning to AI in the medical imaging of COVID-19 can inform and enhance future AI applications, making the whole of the transitions more than the sum of each discipline, for confronting an emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic or solving emerging problems in biomedicine.","output":"Lessons learned in transitioning to AI in the medical imaging of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Autoantibodies (aAbs) to type I interferons (IFNs) have been found in <1% of individuals under the age of 60 in the general population, with the prevalence increasing among those over 65. Neutralizing autoantibodies (naAbs) to type I IFNs have been found in at least 15% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in several cohorts of primarily European descent. We aimed to define the prevalence of aAbs to IFN-2 in 3,456 Japanese controls aged 20C91 and of aAbs and naAbs to IFN-2 and IFN- in 627 Japanese COVID-19 patients aged 0C104, among whom were 170 critical, 235 severe, 112 moderate, 105 mild, and 5 asymptomatic infections. METHODS: ELISA and ISRE reporter assays were used to detect aAbs and naAbs using E. coli-produced IFNs. RESULTS: In an uninfected general Japanese population aged 20C91, we found aAbs in 0.087% of individuals. naAbs to type I IFNs (IFN-2 and/or IFN-, 100 pg/mL) were detected in 10.6% of patients with critical infections, 2.6% of patients with severe infections, and 1% of patients with asymptomatic to mild infections. They were higher in COVID-19 patients over 50 (5.8%) than in younger patients (0%) and higher in men (5.5%) than in women (1.1%). A significant but not strong correlation between aAbs and naAbs to IFN-2 existed (r=?0.307, p-value<0.0001), stressing the importance of measuring naAbs.

We report how a decision might be reached and reported on, to include or exclude these participants. We illustrate using a motivating scenario from the BREATHE trial (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02426112) evaluating azithromycin for the treatment of chronic lung disease in people aged 6C19 years with HIV in Zimbabwe and Malawi. KEY POINTS: Including all enrolled and randomised participants in the primary analysis of a trial ensures an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect using intention-to-treat principles, and minimises the effects of confounding through balanced allocation to trial arm. Ineligible participants are sometimes enrolled, due to measurement or human error. Of 347 participants enrolled into the BREATHE trial, 11 (3.2%) were subsequently found to be ineligible based on lung function criteria. We assumed no safety risk of azithromycin treatment; their inclusion in the trial and subsequent analysis of the intervention effect therefore mirrors clinical practice. Senior trial investigators considered diurnal variations in the measurement of lung function, advantages of retaining a higher sample size and advice from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Trial Steering Committee, and decided to include these participants in primary analysis. We planned and reported analyses including and excluding these participants, and in our case the interpretation of treatment effect was consistent. CONCLUSION: The decision, by senior investigators, on whether to exclude enrolled participants, should reflect issues of safety, treatment efficacy, statistical power and measurement error. As long as decisions are made prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan for the trial, the risk of exclusions creating bias should be minimal. The decision taken should be transparently reported and a sensitivity analysis can present the opposite decision.","output":"Exclusion of enrolled participants in randomised controlled trials: what to do with ineligible participants?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs play vital roles in regulating the battle between pathogens and host cells during viral challenging.

To explore the role of miR-4331-5p in FMDV infection, we detected the expression level of miR-4331-5p in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. The results showed that FMDV infection directly upregulates miR-4331-5p expression, while transfection of mimics or inhibitor of miR-4331-5p promotes or inhibits FMDV replication. Further investigation clearly showed that miR-4331-5p increases FMDV replication through inhibiting type I interferon pathways.

Bleeding is an expected complication, and its risk is assumed to be increased in patients on anticoagulants. However, the effect of anticoagulation on BM biopsy safety is unclear and guidelines are lacking robust data in this regard. As such, physicians use their clinical judgement to guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To provide the best available evidence regarding management of anticoagulation in patients who need BM biopsy. METHODS: We reviewed and summarized available guidelines directing management of periprocedural anticoagulation for BM biopsy, and share our experience and practices with BM biopsy at our institution. RESULTS: The incidence of significant hemorrhage after BM biopsy is very low (0.007-1.1%). BM biopsy is classified as having a low to moderate bleeding risk. Interrupting anticoagulation is not consistently recommended. Strategies exist to minimize bleeding risk for anticoagulated patients. Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms can develop an acquired von Willebrand syndrome which increases their risk for bleeding and therefore require extra vigilance to ensure appropriate hemostasis. CONCLUSION: Withholding anticoagulation prior to BM biopsy is not routinely recommended. Instead, assessment and optimization of bleeding risk factors should be done on a patient by patient basis.","output":"Anticoagulation and bone marrow biopsy: is it safe to proceed?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A membrane bioreactor (MBR) with gravity drain was tested for virus rejection with two coliphages, T4 and f2, which were used as surrogates for human enteric viruses.

In tap water system, 2.1 lg rejection of coliphage T4 could be achieved by PVDF membrane compared with complete rejection by PP membrane, while for coliphage f2 with smaller diameter, 0.3C0.5 lg rejection of the influent virus was removed by the two membranes. In domestic wastewater system, cake layer and gel layer on the membrane surface changed the cut-off size of the membrane so that there was no significant difference between PP and PVDF for each coliphage. The removal ratios of coliphage T4 and f2 in the MBR were more than 5.5 and 3.0 lg, respectively. Compared with 5.5 lg removal for virus T4 in the MBR system, only 2.1 lg (96.8%C99.9%) removal rate was observed in the conventional activated sludge system with the influent virus concentration fluctuating from 1830 to 57000 PFU/mL. Only 0.8%C22% virus removal was the effect of adsorption to activated sludge, which showed a decreasing tendency with the retention time, while 75%C98% was the effect of virus inactivation by microbial activity.

A total of 85 participants (aged 18C56 years) were recruited for a study that examined how two types of planning (Action and Coping) could bridge the intention-behaviour gap and increase physical exercise behaviours. The online study took place over two weeks, with participants completing pre- and post- measures of past exercise habits, intentions to exercise, subsequent physical exercise behaviours, intrinsic motivation levels, and engagement in action and coping planning. A hierarchical regression analysis showed that intentions, past exercise habits and action planning were significant predictors of change in physical exercise behaviours. Positive correlations were observed between participants past habits and their exercise behaviours during the study. 71.8% of participants met the World Health Organizations (WHO) recommended guidelines for physical activity at the end of the study compared to the initial 58.8%, which evidences a significant increase in participant physical exercise behaviours. Our findings revealed that while intentions are important predictors for behavioural change, cultivating habits to engage in regular exercise seems to outweigh the significance of intentions. Moreover, action planning could be a helpful intervention to bridge the intention-behaviour gap to increase overall physical exercise behaviours.

Here, we focus on zinc deficiency symptoms, symptom overlap with other conditions, as well as zinc effects on immune health and mechanistic zinc deficiency risk groups. There are well-studied beneficial effects of zinc on the immune system including a decreased susceptibility to and improved clinical outcomes for infectious pathogens including multiple viruses. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress agent, relevant to some severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is common worldwide and not exclusive to the developing world. Lifestyle choices and preexisting conditions alone can result in zinc deficiency, and we compile zinc risk groups based on a review of the literature. It is also important to distinguish chronic zinc deficiency from deficiency acquired upon viral infection and immune response and their different supplementation strategies. Zinc is being considered as prophylactic or adjunct therapy for COVID-19, with 12 clinical trials underway, highlighting the relevance of this trace element for global pandemics. Using the example of zinc, we show that there is a critical need for a deeper understanding of essential trace elements in human health, and the resulting deficiency symptoms and their overlap with other conditions.

Men chronically exposed to training for endurance sports exhibit persistently reduced basal free and total testosterone concentrations without concurrent luteinizing hormone elevations. These men are deemed to have the \\"Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition\\" (EHMC). Broadly, dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis is associated with either of these states. In women this effect on the axis is linked to the existence of a low energy availability (LEA) state, research in men relative to LEA is ongoing. The exact physiological mechanism inducing the reduction of testosterone in these men is currently unclear but is postulated to be a dysfunction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis. The potential exists for the reduced testosterone concentrations within EHMC men to be disruptive and detrimental to some anabolic-androgenic testosterone-dependent physiological processes. Findings, while limited, suggest spermatogenesis problems may exist in some cases; thus, infertility risk in such men is a critical concern. Present evidence suggests the EHMC condition is limited to men who have been persistently involved in chronic endurance exercise training for an extended period of time, and thus is not a highly prevalent occurrence. Nevertheless, it is critical that endocrinologist and fertility clinicians become more aware of the existence of EHMC as a potential problem-diagnosis in their male patients who exercise.","output":"Reproductive Dysfunction from Exercise Training: The \\"Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition\\"."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"State shelter-in-place (SIP) orders limited the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. However, impacts may have varied by state, creating opportunities to learn from states where SIPs have been effective.

As tumor size and location can affect ablation results, procedural planning needs to identify these factors to limit treatment to a single session and increase ablation success. PURPOSE To identify factors that may affect the primary efficacy of complete renal tumor ablation with radiofrequency after a single session. MATERIAL AND METHODS Percutaneous RFA (using an impedance based system) was performed using computed tomography (CT) guidance. Fifty-two renal tumors (in 44 patients) were retrospectively studied (median follow-up, 7 months). Data collection included patient demographics, tumor data (modified Renal Nephrometry Score, histopathological diagnosis), RFA treatment data (electrode placement), and follow-up results (tumor relapse). Data were analyzed through generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Primary efficacy rate was 83%. Predictors for complete ablation were optimal electrode placement (P = 0.002, OR = 16.67) and increasing distance to the collecting system (P = 0.02, OR = 1.18). Tumor size was not a predictor for complete ablation (median size, 24 mm; P = 0.069, OR = 0.47), but all tumors 2 cm were completely ablated. All papillary tumors and oncocytomas were completely ablated in a single session; the most common incompletely ablated tumor type was clear cell carcinoma (6 of 9). CONCLUSION Optimal electrode placement and a long distance from the collecting system are associated with an increased primary efficacy of renal tumor RFA.

People with diabetes are particularly at high risk of becoming seriously unwell after contracting this virus. METHODS: This population-based study included people living in the Greater Manchester conurbation who had a recorded diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and subsequent Covid-19 infection. Each individual with T1DM (n = 862) or T2DM (n = 13,225) was matched with three Covid-19-infected non-diabetes controls. RESULTS: For individuals with T1DM, hospital admission rate in the first 28 days after a positive Covid-19 test was 10% vs 4.7% in age/gender-matched controls [relative risk (RR) 2.1]. For individuals with T2DM, hospital admission rate after a positive Covid-19 test was 16.3% vs 11.6% in age/gender-matched controls (RR 1.4). The average Townsend score was higher in T2DM (1.8) vs matched controls (0.4), with a higher proportion of people with T2DM observed in the top two quintiles of greatest disadvantage (p < 0.001). For Covid-19-infected individuals with T1DM, factors influencing admission likelihood included age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, HbA1c, low HDL-cholesterol, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and being of African/mixed ethnicity. In Covid-19-infected individuals with T2DM, factors related to a higher admission rate included age, Townsend index, comorbidity with COPD/asthma and severe mental illness (SMI), lower eGFR. Metformin prescription lowered the likelihood. For multivariate analysis in combined individuals with T2DM/controls, factors relating to higher likelihood of admission were having T2DM/age/male gender/diagnosed COPD/diagnosed hypertension/social deprivation (higher Townsend index) and non-white ethnicity (all groups). CONCLUSION: In a UK population we have confirmed a significantly higher likelihood of admission in people with diabetes following Covid-19 infection. A number of factors mediate that increased likelihood of hospital admission. For T2DM, the majority of factors related to increased admission rate are common to the general population but more prevalent in T2DM.

Reliable detection of antibodies to specific pathogens in bats is thus epidemiologically critical. Eight variable flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) were immunized with 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA). Each bat received monthly inoculations for 2 months. Affinity-purified IgG was used for production of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-variable flying fox IgG antibodies. ELISA and western blot analysis were used to monitor immune responses and for assessment of polyclonal and monoclonal antibody species cross-reactivity. Protein G, polyclonal antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies detected specific anti-DNP antibody responses in immunized variable flying foxes, with protein G being the most sensitive, followed by monoclonal antibodies and then polyclonal antibodies. While the polyclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of all bat species tested, some non-specific background was observed. The monoclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of six other species in the genus Pteropus and to cross-react less strongly against IgG from Eidolon helvum or Phyllostomus hastatus. Protein G distinguished best between vaccinated and unvaccinated bats, and these results validate the use of protein G for detection of bat IgG.

We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Recent studies have focused on the potential antitumor activity of lycorine. In our previous study, we found that lycorine decrease the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. METHODS: Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562 were treated with lycorine. Cell viability was monitored using the method of CCK-8. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was detected by HDAC colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle related proteins were identified using Western blot. RESULTS: In the present study, we further revealed that lycorine can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells. Analysis of HDAC activity showed that lycroine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HDAC activity has been associated with cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. We evaluated the cell cycle distribution after lycorine treatment and found that lycorine causes cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. To investigate the mechanism behind this cell cycle arrest, G1-related proteins were assayed by Western blot. After lycorine treatment, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expressions were inhibited and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation was reduced. Lycorine treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of p53 and its target gene product, p21. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity is responsible for at least part of the induction of cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by lycorine and provide a mechanistic framework for further exploring the use of lycorine as a novel antitumor agent.","output":"Lycorine induces cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in K562 cells via HDAC inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent clinical trial reports pertaining to the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 albeit yet to be validated with larger clinical trials, have sparked much interest globally to evaluate whether this anti-malarial drug can be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.

National models may not be applicable at the county level, where limited test availability and/or delays in test results may alter the relationship between COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths. Methods: Publicly available data for daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 4th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020 in Dallas County was obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services website on December 17th, 2020. COVID-19 cases were reported by local health departments based on the date of test results, while deaths were reported based on death certificates. Due to the lag in case and death reporting, the last two weeks prior to the date of download were excluded. A linear regression was performed using the 7-day rolling average of newly reported cases vs the 7-day rolling average of new deaths utilizing different lag periods. The lag period resulting in the highest R2 value was identified. A similar analysis was subsequently performed in three other Texas counties. Results: Dallas County, which has a population of 2.636 million, had 114,981 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1708 COVID-19 related deaths over the study period. As shown in Figure 1A, The maximum R2 value was observed at a lag period of 10 days (R2 = 0.8158, p &lt; 0.001). Spikes in cases were seen in July and late November, with deaths following shortly after (Figure 1B). Similar results were seen in Tarrant and Bexar counties, with a maximum R2 value occurring at a lag period of 12 and 7 days (R2 = 0.7323, R2 = 0.7800), respectively. However, Harris County had a maximum R2 value at a lag of only 2 days (R2 = 0.7324). Discussion: Potential contributors to the lag between diagnosis and death include the disease process itself as well as county specific delays in testing and/or testing reporting. In particular, in locations with large surges, cases may overwhelm testing capabilities such that mean case count is under reported, and more cases are identified late in the disease process. Conclusions: In all four counties, peaks in deaths from COVID-19 closely followed peaks in reported cases. In three of four counties, the lag was 7-12 days, consistent with the expected lag between diagnosis and death. In Harris county however, the lag was only 2 days, supporting the idea that national models may not be applicable at a county level.","output":"Correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths in four texas counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Parasite\\\\driven declines in wildlife have become increasingly common and can pose significant risks to natural populations. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite\\\\mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.","output":"Infectious Diseases and Extinction Risk in Wild Mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to considerable morbidity/mortality worldwide, but most infections, especially among children, have a mild course. However, it remains largely unknown whether infected children develop cellular immune memory. METHODS: To determine whether a memory T cell response is being developed, we performed a longitudinal assessment of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response by IFN- ELISPOT and activation marker analyses of peripheral blood samples from unvaccinated children and adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. RESULTS: Upon stimulation of PBMCs with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or overlapping peptides of spike (S-SARS-CoV-2) and nucleocapsid proteins, we found S-SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN- T cell responses in infected children (83%) and adults (100%) that were absent in unexposed controls. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in infected adults, especially in those with moderate symptoms, compared to infected children. The S-SARS-CoV-2 IFN- T cell response correlated with S1-SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody concentrations. Predominantly, effector memory CD4(+) T cells of a Th1 phenotype were activated upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were significantly reduced at 10 months after symptom onset, while S1-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG concentrations were still detectable in 90% of all children and adults.

METHODS: We developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) among consecutively hospitalised adults with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were prospectively recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales. Candidate predictors that were specified a priori were considered for inclusion in the model on the basis of previous prognostic scores and emerging literature describing routinely measured biomarkers associated with COVID-19 prognosis. We used internalCexternal cross-validation to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across eight National Health Service (NHS) regions in the development cohort. We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London). FINDINGS: 74 944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31 924 (432%) of 73 948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome. In internalCexternal cross-validation in the development cohort of 66 705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions. In held-out data from London (n=8239), the model showed a similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 077 [95% CI 076 to 078]; calibration-in-the-large 000 [C005 to 005]); calibration slope 096 [091 to 101]), and greater net benefit than any other reproducible prognostic model.

Methods: We used blood samples from health care workers (HCW) with or without history of COVID-19 to define test accuracy of a novel interferon-{gamma} release assay. Usefulness of qualitative and quantitative results after COVID-19 vaccination was examined in HCW receiving homologous or heterologous vaccination regimens. For a real-life performance evaluation, we analysed interferon-{gamma} response to complete vaccination in 149 patients receiving immunosuppressive or immune modulating therapies. Results: Using a double-cut-off strategy integrating the result of background stimulation the assay had a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of the IGRA was 83.5 and 100% in HCW after SARS-CoV-2 infection more or less than 6 months ago. Quantitative results showed significant differences between first and second vaccine dose, but no difference between homologous and heterologous vaccination regimen. The majority of immunocompromised patients showed no immune response or isolated T-cell or antibody response to complete vaccination. Conclusions: The novel IGRA proved to be a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 vaccination.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) inhibits the synthesis of type I IFNs. However, whether PRRSV can inhibit IFN signaling is less well understood. In the present study, we found that PRRSV interferes with the IFN signaling pathway. The transcript levels of IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and ISG56 and protein level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) in PRRSV VR2385-infected MARC-145 cells were significantly lower than those in mock-infected cells after IFN- treatment. IFN-induced phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 and their heterodimer formation in the PRRSV-infected cells were not affected. However, the majority of the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (IFN regulatory factor 9) heterotrimers remained in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected cells, which indicates that the nuclear translocation of the heterotrimers was blocked. Overexpression of NSP1 of PRRSV VR2385 inhibited expression of ISG15 and ISG56 and blocked nuclear translocation of STAT1, which suggests that NSP1 might be the viral protein responsible for the inhibition of IFN signaling. PRRSV infection in primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also inhibited IFN--stimulated expression of the ISGs and the STAT2 protein. In contrast, a licensed low-virulence vaccine strain, Ingelvac PRRS modified live virus (MLV), activated expression of IFN-inducible genes, including those of chemokines and antiviral proteins, in PAMs without the addition of external IFN and had no detectable effect on IFN signaling.

Due to the increasing use of such touchscreens and the growing awareness of infection risks, approaches that allow safe and automatic disinfection are desired. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, with its known antimicrobial efficacy, could achieve this goal, but should be executed with limited touchscreen degradation, disinfection duration, and energy consumption. It should also pose as little harm as possible to humans even in case of failure. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed first to identify the microorganisms most commonly found on touchscreens. Then, the 90% reduction doses (D90 doses) for the different relevant microorganisms and UV spectral ranges were determined from the literature, and irradiation doses are suggested that should reduce most of these important microorganisms by 5 log-levels. Results: The most frequent microorganisms are staphylococci, bacilli, micrococci, enterococci, pseudomonads and E. coli with small differences between hospital and community environments, if antibiotic resistance properties are ignored. The determined irradiation doses for a 5 log-reduction of the most frequent microorganisms are about 40 mJ/cm(2), 80 J/cm(2), 500 J/cm(2) and 50 mJ/cm(2) for the UV spectral ranges UVC, UVB, UVA and far-UVC, respectively. These doses are also sufficient to inactivate all nosocomial ESKAPE pathogens on touchscreens by at least 99.999%. Conclusion: Disinfection is achievable in all UV spectral ranges, with UVC being the most effective, enabling automatic disinfection within a minute or less. The much higher doses required in the UVB and UVA spectral range result in much longer disinfection durations, with the advantage of a reduced risk to humans. For all kinds of UV irradiation, the doses should be limited to reasonable values to avoid irradiating an already more or less sterile surface and to prevent degradation of touchscreen devices.","output":"Review of microbial touchscreen contamination for the determination of reasonable ultraviolet disinfection doses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the technique used in our department, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) anatomically only differs from the mini- or omega loop gastric bypass (OLGB) by the incorporation of an isolated alimentary limb, called the Roux limb. The metabolic consequences of the incorporation of a Roux limb are unknown. OBJECTIVES To evaluate differences in glucose and insulin dynamics between RYGB and OLGB in normoglycemic patients, by submitting them to a glucose challenge after stabilization of their weight. METHODS Nondiabetic patients who had undergone OLGB 4 years earlier were matched with nondiabetic patients who had undergone RYGB around the same time and with healthy controls. Participants underwent oral (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Endpoints of the study were: progression of plasma glucose and insulin, changes in their concentration [calculated by area under the curve (AUC)] at OGTT and IVGTT, incretin effect and incidence of hypoglycemia. RESULTS Each of the three groups comprised 14 participants. At OGTT, plasma glucose and insulin incremental values were comparable after OLGB and RYGB, and substantially higher than in controls. Overall glucose concentration, however, did not vary across the three groups. Thirty-minute and overall insulin plasma concentration, indicators of early and total insulin secretion, respectively, was significantly higher in both bypass groups than in controls, and was greatest in OLGB. Severe hypoglycemia occurred in one out of two patients in both bypass groups. At IVGTT, no differences were registered across the three groups and no participant experienced hypoglycemia. The incretin effect was higher after OLGB than after RYGB, but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The incorporation of a Roux limb in a loop gastric bypass appears to create a statistically nonsignificant tendency toward reducing insulin hypersecretion observed at OGTT after OLGB, and consequently toward tapering the incretin effect.","output":"Metabolic consequences of the incorporation of a Roux limb in an omega loop (mini) gastric bypass: evaluation by a glucose tolerance test at mid-term follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Demonstrasi dalam konteks demokrasi sangat memiliki keterkaitan erat dalam negara yang demokratis.

Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices.

There is strong evidence to show that the barriers to locally led research do not vary largely between disease, study type and location and can be largely solved by addressing these common gaps. The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. EDCTP has established a model of long-term sustainable capacity development integrated into clinical trials which addresses this lack of locally led research in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the development of individual and institutional capacity and research outputs that change the management, prevention and treatment of poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases across Africa. In recognition of emergent data on what the barriers and enablers are to long-term, sustainable capabilities to run studies, EDCTP formed a new collaboration with The Global Health Network (TGHN) in September 2017, with the aim to make a set of cross-cutting tools and resources to support the planning, writing and delivery of high-quality clinical trials available to research staff wherever they are in the world, especially those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) via TGHN platform. These new resources developed on the EDCTP Knowledge Hub are those identified in the mixed method study described in this commentary as being key to addressing the gaps that the research community report as the most limiting elements in their ability to design and implement studies. The Knowledge Hub aims to make these tools freely available to any potential health research team in need of support and guidance in designing and running their own studies, particularly in low-resource settings. The purpose is to provide open access to the specific guidance, information and tools these teams cannot otherwise access freely. Ultimately, this will enable them to design and lead their own high-quality studies addressing local priorities with global alignment, generating new data that can change health outcomes in their communities.

Anecdotal reports indicate a falling rate of acute stroke diagnoses in these hospitals during the COVID-19 period. We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in acute stroke presentation at the designated COVID-19 hospitals. Methods: This retrospective observational study included all patients admitted to Yongchuan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University with acute stroke between January 24 and March 10, 2020. Patient demographics, characteristics of the stroke, treatment details, and clinical outcomes were compared with those of patients admitted in the corresponding period in the year before (2019, the pre-COVID-19 period). Subgroup analysis was performed in the ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke groups. Results: A total of 110 patients presented with acute stroke symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 173 patients in the pre-COVID-19 period. A higher proportion of stroke patients presented to the hospital via emergency medical services during the pandemic (48.2 vs. 31.8%, p = 0.006). There was a lower proportion of ischemic stroke patients (50.9 vs. 65.3%, p = 0.016) than in the preceding year. There were significantly fewer patients with 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 3 in the COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID-19 period (17.3 vs. 30.6%, p = 0.012). Among patients with ischemic stroke, the mean time from patient arrival to vessel puncture for emergency endovascular therapy in the COVID-19 period was shorter than that in the pre-COVID-19 period (109.18  71.39 vs. 270.50  161.51 min, p = 0.002). Among patients with hemorrhagic stroke, the rate of emergency surgical operation in the COVID-19 period was higher than that in the pre-COVID-19 period (48.1 vs. 30.0%, p = 0.047). The mean time from patient arrival to emergency surgical operation (15.31  22.89 vs. 51.72  40.47 min, p = 0.002) was shorter in the COVID-19 period than in the pre-COVID-19 period. Conclusions: Although fewer acute stroke patients sought medical care in this designated COVID-19 hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, this type of hospital was more efficient for timely treatment of acute stroke. Recognizing how acute strokes presented in designated COVID-19 hospitals will contribute to appropriate adjustments in strategy for dealing with acute stroke during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Acute Stroke Presentation in a Designated COVID-19 Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has been useful in tracking its spread and in identifying variants of concern (VOC).

Analysing 1347 samples collected till June 2020, we recorded 16 410 iSNV sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found 42% of the iSNV sites to be reported as SNVs by 30 September 2020 in consensus sequences submitted to GISAID, which increased to 80% by 30th June 2021. Following this, analysis of another set of 1774 samples sequenced in India between November 2020 and May 2021 revealed that majority of the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) lineage-defining variations appeared as iSNVs before getting fixed in the population. Besides, mutations in RdRp as well as RNA-editing by APOBEC and ADAR deaminases seem to contribute to the differential prevalence of iSNVs in hosts. We also observe hyper-variability at functionally critical residues in Spike protein that could alter the antigenicity and may contribute to immune escape.

A 22 factorial experiment was used to randomly allocate 60 steers in year 1 (YR1) and 44 steers in year 2 (YR2). The two beef genotypes evaluated were Red Angus (RA), and RA x Akaushi (AK) crossbreed. The steers were allotted to two finishing feeding systems: grazing, a multi-species forage mixture (GRASS) and feedlot finishing, conventional total mixed ration (GRAIN). All steers were slaughtered on the same day, at 26 and 18 mo of age (GRASS and GRAIN, respectively), and carcass data were collected 48 h postmortem. Growth and slaughter characteristics were significantly impacted by the finishing system (P < 0.01), with the best results presented by GRAIN. Beef genotype affected dressing percent (P < 0.01), ribeye area (P = 0.04), and marbling score (P = 0.01). The AK steers had a tendency (P = 0.09) for lower total gain; however, carcass quality scores were greater compared to RA. There was a genotype by system interaction for USDA yield grade (P < 0.01), where it was lower in GRASS compared to GRAIN in both genotypes, and no difference was observed between the two genotypes for any GRASS or GRAIN systems. There was no difference in meat quality or sensory attributes (P > 0.10) between the two genotypes, except that steaks from AK tended to be juicier than RA (P = 0.06). Thawing loss and color variables were impacted by the finishing system (P < 0.01). L* (lightness) and hue angle presented greater values while a* (redness), b* (yellowness), and chroma presented lower values in GRAIN compared to GRASS. Sensory attributes were scored better in GRAIN than GRASS beef (P < 0.01). There was a genotype by system interaction for flavor (P = 0.02), where beef from RA had a lower flavor rating in GRASS than in GRAIN, and no difference was observed for AK. Within each system, no difference was observed for flavor between RA and AK. Beef from steers in GRASS had greater (P < 0.01) WBSF than those from GRAIN. These results indicate that steers from GRAIN had superior performance and carcass merit and that AK enhanced these traits to a greater degree compared to RA. Furthermore, the beef finishing system had a marked impact on the steaks' sensory attributes and consumer acceptability. The favorable results for texture and juiciness in GRAIN, which likely impacted overall acceptability, may be related to high marbling.","output":"Influence of beef genotypes on animal performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and sensory characteristics in grazing or feedlot-finished steers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is reported about the case of a 3-year-old girl who was admitted to hospital with high fever, vomiting, skin rash, dehydration, suspected staphyloderma and for exclusion of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2-infection (SARS-CoV?2 infection).

To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia. METHODS: Using clinically validated antibody panels we studied leukocytes from 29 patients with PCR-proven COVID-19. Ten were hypoxic requiring ventilatory support, eleven were febrile but otherwise well, and eight were convalescing having previously required ventilatory support. Additionally, we analysed patients who did not have COVID-19 but received ventilatory support for other reasons. We examined routine Full Blood Count (FBC) specimens that were surplus to routine diagnostic requirements; normal ranges were established in a historic group of healthy volunteers. FINDINGS: We observed striking and unexpected differences in cells of the innate immune system. Levels of CD11b and CD18, which together comprise Complement Receptor 3 (CR3), were increased in granulocytes and monocytes from hypoxic COVID-19 patients, but not in those with COVID-19 who remained well, or in those without COVID-19 but ventilated for other reasons. Granulocyte and monocyte numbers were unchanged, however Natural Killer (NK) cell numbers were two-fold higher than normal in COVID-19 patients who remained well. INTERPRETATION: CR3 is central to leukocyte activation and subsequent cytokine release in response to infection. It is also a fibrinogen receptor, and its over-expression in granulocytes and monocytes of patients with respiratory failure tables it as a candidate effector of both the thrombotic and inflammatory features of COVID-19 pneumonia, and both a biomarker of impending respiratory failure and potential therapeutic target. NK cells are innate immune cells that retain immunological memory. Rapid expansion of memory NK cells targeting common antigens shared with other Coronaviruses may explain why most patients with COVID-19 do not develop respiratory complications. Understanding the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-may uncover why most infected individuals experience mild symptoms, and inform a preventive approach to COVID-19 pneumonia in the future.","output":"Increased Complement Receptor-3 levels in monocytes and granulocytes distinguish COVID-19 patients with pneumonia from those with mild symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To analyze the recent severity of COVID-19 in various countries. METHODS Data were ollected on the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in various countries as of January 16, 2021, and the scale and overall trend of the epidemic were retrospectively described; combined with the recent trend of newly confirmed cases, from January 10 to 16 (the 54th week) and the newly confirmed cases indexes, such as the number and incidence density the severity of the epidemic was classified. Feasible suggestions were put forward based on the variation of the virus, actual data of vaccine research and development and possible existence in many countries. RESULTS Up to January 16, 2021, there were 92 510 419 confirmed cases worldwide; 4 849 301 new confirmed cases were confirmed in the 54th week, and they were still growing. Among all the continents, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Europe, North America, and Asia has exceeded 21 million, and the number of new confirmed cases in a single week in North America, South America and Asia were all increasing. Among the countries, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in 18 countries including the United States, India, and Brazil was more than 1 million, accounting for 77.04% of the total number of cumulative confirmed cases in the world. Eleven countries including the United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia, The United Kingdom, Russia, Germany, South Africa, Italy, and India are at higher risk of the epidemic; The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, and Colombia were still experiencing new confirmed cases and increasing status, the risk of the epidemic was greater. Novel coronavirus mutates frequently, up to February 2021, there had been 3 931 mutant genotypes in the world. At the same time, a total of 11 vaccines were successfully launched, however we were still facing some troubles, such as the global shortage of vaccines, the public's willingness to vaccinate needed to be improved, and equity in the distribution of vaccines. CONCLUSION The global epidemic situation is still getting worse, with repeated epidemics in all the continents and countries, and has not been fundamentally controlled. At the continent level, North America, South America, and Europe have the most severe epidemics; at the national level, The United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Colombia and other countries have higher epidemic risks. Focusing on the severely affected countries will help bring the global epidemic under control as soon as possible. Under the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, it is a key and feasible direction to improve the yield and vaccination rate of the vaccines, shorten the onset time of the vaccines and prolong the immune persistence.","output":"[Analysis of the development trend and severity of the COVID-19 panidemic in the global world]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a coronavirus, designed as SARS CoV-2, whose clinical presentation is widely variable, with most patients having mild or no symptoms, but others developing a malign disease with multi-organ failure and even death.

An ominous evolution of COVID-19 has been attributed to an exacerbated inflammatory response, designed as \\"cytokine storm\\" with augmented production of cytokines/chemokines through the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that triggers an inflammatory downstream response, mediated in part by the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Previous studies have reported an increased expression of MyD88 and TLRs in people with obesity, mainly in those with metabolic complications. Therefore, we hypothesize, that an underlying increased Myd88/TLR signaling may predispose to patients with obesity to develop an exaggerated and dangerous inflammatory reaction against SARS CoV-2 infection, explaining at least in part, the higher severity of COVID-19. In addition, MyD88/TLR signaling in people with obesity could have a role in the development of several chronic diseases.","output":"Increased TLR/MyD88 signaling in patients with obesity: is there a link to COVID-19 disease severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The shelter-in-place mandate to mitigate the effects from the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was associated with an increase in admissions of school-aged children to our burn center but a decrease in adult admissions. It was unclear how many admissions were from suspected abuse. Our objective was to determine the social impact of the shelter-in-place mandate on the number of burn admissions secondary to suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic compared to previous years. METHODS: Patients were identified using Institutional Burn Center registry and linked to the clinical and administrative data. All patients admitted from January 1, 2016 to July 31, 2020 with suspected abuse were eligible for inclusion. Demographics, patient and burn characteristics were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with Students t-test, and chi-squared test. RESULTS: There were 7177 patients included in the study. Prior to 2020, each year the percentage of cases with suspected abuse decreased compared to previous years (19% decrease in 2017, 23% decrease in 2018, 30% decrease in 2019). Compared 2019, the number of patients admitted with suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic increased 257%, p=0.00046.

To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extracellular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteolytic processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here. Our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors within the early Golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction. Another v-sis fusion protein was constructed by attaching the transmembrane domain and COOH-terminus of TGN38, a protein that localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This construct was primarily retained intracellularly, although some of the fusion protein reached the surface. Deletion of the COOH-terminal region of the TGN38 retention signal abrogated the TGN-localization, as evidenced by very prominent cell surface localization, and resulted in increased transforming activity. The behavior of the sis-TGN38 derivatives is discussed within the context of the properties of TGN38 itself, which is known to recycle from the cell surface to the TGN.","output":"The v-sis oncoprotein loses transforming activity when targeted to the early Golgi complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Daily new cases of COVID-19 as a series of data points ordered in time is one representation of time series data Our works expect to understand the data characteristics that is related to existing government policies This paper aims to highlight the impact report and analyses of some COVID-19 policies in East Java province districts The study is focused on the policy execution before and during the new normal situation of COVID-19 using time series data of new cases as possible and easily observable results Aside from time series analysis, some visual analysis is performed as well The experiments focused on some questions related to the policy effectiveness: finding patterns of daily new cases to instigate the need for other local policies and understanding any precedence on occurred cases for nearby districts Although the second question is not confirmable, the first question verifies more tightened social distancing is still necessary for the new normal ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Time Series Analysis for Understanding Local Policy Impact of COVID-19 Cases in East Java"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High peak pressures delivered via bag valve mask (BVM) can be dangerous for patients.

Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is cleared based on the power (amplitude) setting and frequency, with lower frequencies resulting in higher V(T) and CO(2) clearance. Airway pressure amplitude is significantly attenuated throughout the respiratory system and mechanical strain and stress on the alveoli are theoretically minimized. HFOV has been purported as a form of lung protective ventilation that minimizes volutrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma. Following two large randomized controlled trials showing no benefit and harm, respectively, HFOV has largely been abandoned in adults with ARDS. A multi-center clinical trial in children is ongoing.

Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use of plastics.

The available evidence indicates that cutaneous signs are heterogeneous and can be divided as follows: a) erythematous rashes, b) lesions of vascular origin, c) vesicular rashes, d) urticarial rashes, and e) acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme (EM) and other polymorphic/atypical reactions. Most cutaneous manifestations appear simultaneously or after respiratory and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, even if rarely urticaria has been reported as the first sign of the disease. It has been proposed that erythematous and vesicular rashes, as well as urticaria, are the result of immunological activation against Sars-CoV-2, similarly to other viral exanthems; alternatively, reactivation or co-infection of herpesviruses and drug hypersensitivity represent possible etiologic diagnosis that has to be considered. Regarding lesions of vascular origin, ischemic ones are the result of systemic hypercoagulability established in severe infections, whereas chilblains seem to be linked to the type I-interferon massively produced to halt virus replication. AGEP is triggered by drugs, whereas EM could represent a delayed immune response to the virus or a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs elicited by the inflammatory process built to fight the infection. A further pathogenic hypothesis is that the virus, or its particles detected in the skin (particularly in endothelium and eccrine glands), could be responsible for certain skin reactions, including chilblains and EM. From the available data, it appears that chilblains are correlated with younger age and less severe disease, while ischemic manifestations occur in the elderly with severe infection.

The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathology of associated acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, coagulopathy and multiorgan failure is not known. SARS-CoV-2 is an envelope virus with S (spike), M (membrane), N (nucleocapsid) and E (envelop) proteins. In a closely related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the transmembrane E protein exerts an important role in membrane-ionic transport through viroporins, deletion of which reduced levels of IL-1? and a remarkably reduced lung edema compared to wild type. IL-1? is generated by macrophages upon activation of intracellular NLRP3 (NOD-like, leucine rich repeat domains, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3), part of the functional NLRP3 inflammasome complex that detects pathogenic microorganisms and stressors, while neutrophils are enhanced by increasing levels of IL-1?. Expiring neutrophils undergo \\"NETosis\\", producing thread-like extracellular structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which protect against mild infections and microbes. However, uncontrolled NET production can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, multiple organ failure, and autoimmune disease. Herein, we present arguments underlying our hypothesis that IL-1? and NETs, mediated via NLRP3 inflammasomes, form a feed-forward loop leading to the excessive alveolar and endothelial damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Considering such assertions, we propose potential drug candidates that could be used to alleviate such pathologies.

In this present scenario, people worldwide are reorganizing their life taking safety precautions like doing frequent sanitization, wearing face masks, and avoiding social gathering to protect themselves from getting infected as the proven vaccine or lifesaving drugs are yet to be discovered. However, deficiency of face mask and their reusability have become a key issue because the used masks need to be discarded after some time. In this background, we propose the design of a self-powered (no external power source) face mask which does not require to be sterilized. The proposed mask is comprised of two differently charged tribo-series materials with outer electrocution layer. Different combinations of tribo-series (+ and ?) materials have been chosen based on their triboelectric properties to generate static electricity. Nanofibers have been considered for their ability to generate a sufficient amount of triboelectricity. Multilayer of electrospun nanofiber-based tribo-materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-nylon and PVDF-poly(ethyl methacrylate) has been used due to the effective air filtration property of nanofibers and generating tribo electricity. In addition, the generated charge via utilization of contact electrification and electrostatic induction is amplified using a suitable energy harvesting circuit. The design of an outer electrocution layer has been made keeping a few nm distances in between the tribo-layers and the electrocution layer to avoid short-circuiting. Metallic nonwoven fabric has been taken in practice to design the outer electrocution layer. In this practice, the harvesting of triboelectric energy has been done using a suitable charging circuit which can generate sufficient voltage (few volts) to trigger the outer electrocution layer. During the wearers inhalation and exhalation, the inner tribo-layers produce triboelectric charges due to mechanical agitation between the layers. Additionally, acoustic or air vibration during talking and different facial expressions of the volunteer will also take part in the generation of effective triboelectric power. The viruses get electrocuted once the droplets containing viruses come in contact to the masks outer layer. In addition, the fitting comfort and the breathing permeability of the proposed mask are also ensured. In this chapter, we shall explain the face masks design and present the analysis results of different physiological inputs for the efficacy of the mask for killing the deadly virus. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Towards the Development of Triboelectricity-Based Virus Killer Face Mask for COVID-19: Role of Different Inputs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UMKM merupakan pelaku ekonomi yang mendukung perekonomian negara memiliki banyak kendala dalam usaha peningkatan kinerja perekonomiannya.

It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant'Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that low FT3 serum levels are associated with severe COVID-19. Our multi-omics approach suggests that T3 is involved in the immune response in COVID-19 and coexistent hematological malignancy and new possible T3 target genes in these patients have been identified.","output":"Gene signature and immune cell profiling by high-dimensional, single-cell analysis in COVID-19 patients, presenting Low T3 syndrome and coexistent hematological malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programming laboratories are very important for students to learn and understand the concepts of programming.

This study aims to synthesize various new polymeric materials called gels, hydrogels, and organo-hydrogels according to the monomer used and to investigate their use as drug release systems. The agar-glycerol (AG) pair was used to synthesize the polymers, N, N, methylene bisacrylamide (MBA, m) and glutaraldehyde (GA, g) were used as cross-linkers and peppermint oil (PmO) was included to obtain the organo-hydrogels. Therefore, one AG gel and two p (AG-m) and p (GA-g) hydrogels were synthesized within the scope of the study. Six different organo-hydrogels based on p(AG-m-PmO) or p (AG-g-PmO) were also synthesized by varying the amount of peppermint oil. Paracetamol and carboplatin were selected as the sample drugs. Synthesized gels, hydrogels and organo-hydrogels were characterized by FTIR and SEM analysis. Additionally, swelling behaviors of the synthesized gels were investigated in different media (ID water, tap water, ethanol, acetone, ethanol/ID water (1:1), acetone/ID water (1:1) and gasoline) and at different pHs. Moreover, it was determined that organo-hydrogels were blood compatible and had antioxidant properties based on hemolysis, blood clotting and antioxidant analysis. Therefore, the release of paracetamol (a known antipyretic-painkiller, recommended and used in the treatment of Covid-19) and carboplatin (widely used in cancer treatment) were studied. Evidently, as the amount of PMO oil increases, the -OH groups in organo-hydrogels will increase and the chemical and physical bonding rates will increase; therefore it was observed that increasing peppermint oil in the organo-hydrogels structure to 0.3 mL stimulated the release of the drugs. For instance, maximum paracetamol release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 72.3% at pH 7.4 and 69.8% at pH 2.0, respectively. The maximum carboplatin release amount from p(AG-g-PmO) and p(AG-m-PmO) organo-hydrogels was calculated to be 99.7% at pH 7.4 and 100% at pH 7.4, respectively.

The patients were divided in two groups corresponding to the first- and second wave of COVID-19 and analysed regarding need of ventilator support and mortality dependent on orders to Do Intubate (DI) or Do Not Intubate (DNI), respectively. Results: The study included 178 patients. The mortality was 24% for patients with DI orders (n=115) and 81% for patients with DNI orders (n=63) increasing to 98% (n=46) for patients with DNI orders and very high flow oxygen requirements (30 L/min).

The research effort was focused on the development of solid foam catalysts based on ruthenium nanoparticles supported on active carbon. This catalyst was used in kinetic experiments on the hydrogenation of l-arabinose and d-galactose at three temperatures (90, 100, and 120 C) and two hydrogen pressures (20 and 40 bar). Kinetic experiments were carried out with binary sugar mixtures at different d-galactose-to-l-arabinose molar ratios to study the interactions of these sugars in the presence of the prepared solid foam catalyst. The solid foam catalyst preparation comprised the following steps: cutting of the open-cell foam aluminum pieces, anodic oxidation pretreatment, carbon coating, acid pretreatment, ruthenium incorporation, and ex situ reduction. The carbon coating method comprised the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol, followed by a pyrolysis process and activation with oxygen. Incorporation of ruthenium on the carbon-coated foam was done by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI), using ruthenium(III) nitrosyl nitrate as the precursor. By applying IWI, it was possible to prepare an active catalyst with a ruthenium load of 1.12 wt %, which gave a high conversion of the sugars to the corresponding sugar alcohols. The catalysts were characterized by SEM, HR-TEM, TPR, and ICP-OES to interpret the catalyst behavior in terms of activity, durability, and critical parameters for the catalyst preparation. Extensive kinetic experiments were carried out in an isothermal laboratory-scale semibatch reactor to which gaseous hydrogen was constantly added. High selectivities toward the sugar alcohols, arabitol and galactitol, exceeding 98% were obtained for both sugars, and the sugar conversions were within the range of 53C97%, depending on temperature. The temperature effect on the reaction rate was very strong, while the effect of hydrogen pressure was minor. Regarding the sugar mixtures, in general, l-arabinose presented a higher reaction rate, and an acceleration of the hydrogenation process was observed for both sugars as the ratio of d-galactose to l-arabinose increased, evidently because of competitive interactions on the catalyst surface.","output":"Solid Foam Ru/C Catalysts for Sugar Hydrogenation to Sugar AlcoholsPreparation, Characterization, Activity, and Selectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virtual methods have been innovatively utilized to provide clinical and supportive care to patients with cancer.

The clinical outcomes were no different between hospitalized IMID and non IMID patients. Conclusions: IMID and its treatments do not determine the outcome of patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"CARACTERSTICAS DE PACIENTES CON ENFERMEDADES INFLAMATORIAS INMUNOMEDIADAS HOSPITALIZADOS POR INFECCIN POR SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viruses are important triggers of asthma exacerbations. They are also detected outside of exacerbation. Alteration of anti-viral response in asthmatic patients has been shown although the mechanisms responsible for this defect remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare in virus-infected and not-infected allergic asthmatic children, aged 6 to 16 years, admitted to hospital for a severe exacerbation, the innate immune response and especially the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and their function. METHODS: Virus identification was performed both during the exacerbation and at steady state (eight weeks later). Data assessed at both periods included clinical features, anti-viral response and inflammation (in sputum and plasma), and PRR expression/function in blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Viruses were identified in 46 out of 72 children (median age 8.9 years) during exacerbation, and among them, in 17 at steady state. IFN-, IFN- and IL-29 levels in sputum and plasma were similar between infected and not infected patients at both times, as well as the expression of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 in blood monocytes and dendritic cells. Airway inflammation in infected patients was characterized by significantly higher IL-5 concentration and eosinophil count. Compared to patients only infected at exacerbation, the re-infected children significantly exhibited lower levels of IFN- in plasma and sputum at exacerbation associated with modifications in PRR expression and function in blood mononuclear cells. These re-infected patients also presented an airway neutrophilic inflammation at steady state. CONCLUSION: Our results reports in asthmatic children that impaired anti-viral response during virus-induced exacerbation is more pronounced in a subgroup of patients prone to re-infection by virus. This subgroup is characterized by altered PRR function and a different pattern of airway inflammation.

A sample of 235 subjects (73.2% girls;ages 12C18 years, M = 16.08, SD = 1.7) was involved. Participants were asked to complete part of the MADRE Questionnaire, as well as to report their Most Recent Dream by responding to specific questions related to this dream content (e.g., positive vs. negative emotions, realism/bizarreness, and presence of sensory impressions). Results indicated that participants most strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic reported the strongest effects on their dreams, as well as longest dreams. Results also indicated that girls recall dreams more often than boys, in addition to reporting higher emotional intensity, predominantly negative emotions, and more nightmares, including recurrent ones. Finally, the most recent dreams were set in both indoor and outdoor settings, with many family members and friends present. They were marked by strong negative emotions, especially related to dangerous, violent, and frustrating situations.

Proven communications of the gut microbiota with the pulmonary microbiota (gutClung axis) and the pathway of neural connections between the gut and brain (gutCbrain axis) may be important in the face of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was shown to affect almost all organs because of the presence of a host receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor is mainly present in the brush border of intestinal enterocytes, ciliary cells, and type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs. The transport function of ACE2 has been linked to the ecology of gut microbes in the digestive tract, suggesting that COVID-19 may be related to the gut microbiota. The severity of COVID-19 may be associated with a number of comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and/or old age; therefore, attention is also paid to multiple morbidities and the modulation of microbiota through comorbidities and medications.

This preference for relatively less risky firms, which later reverses, suggests a reallocation towards safer assets given the higher uncertainty at the beginning of the crisis. We also find that funds preferred growth firms over value firms as value firms with greater invested capital are likely to be less resilient to the crisis-induced shock. Institutional investors have also favored group-affiliated firms throughout the crisis, reflective of their ability to negotiate through the protracted economic shock.

We decompose the patient flow problem into four subcategories: prediction of demand on a healthcare institution, prediction of the demand and resource required to transfer patients from the emergency department to the hospital, prediction of potential resource required for the treatment and movement of inpatients and prediction of length-of-stay and discharge timing. We argue that there are benefits to both approaches of considering the healthcare institution as a whole as well as the patient by patient case and that ideally a combination of these would be best for improving patient flow through hospitals. We also argue that it is essential for there to be a shared dataset that will allow researchers to benchmark their algorithms on and thereby allow future researchers to build on that which has already been done. We conclude that machine learning for the improvement of patient flow is still a young field with very few papers tailor-making machine learning methods for the problem being considered. Future works should consider the need to transfer algorithms trained on a dataset to multiple hospitals and allowing for dynamic algorithms which will allow real-time decision-making to help clinical staff on the shop floor.","output":"Machine learning in patient flow: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Integrating smart pumps with an electronic health record (EHR) reduces medication errors by automating pump programming and EHR documentation. This study describes the patient safety and financial impact of pump-EHR interoperability at a community hospital. METHODS: A 316-bed community hospital in Sugar Land, TX, went live with pump-EHR interoperability in October 2019. Data were collected from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019 (before implementation) and from April 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020 (after implementation). Rates of drug library compliance, alert firing, alert override, override within 2 seconds, high-risk alert override, and alert resulting in pump reprogramming were measured. Financial impact was measured by Current Procedural Terminology code capture per kept appointment in the infusion center. RESULTS: Drug library compliance increased from 73.8% to 82.9% with pump-EHR interoperability (P < 0.001). Infusions generating alerts among all infusions programmed with the drug library decreased from 3.5% to 2.6% (P < 0.001), overridden alerts increased from 64.8% to 68.9% (P < 0.001), alerts overridden within 2 seconds decreased from 17.3% to 13.8% (P < 0.001), and reprogrammed alerts decreased from 20.7% to 18.3% (P = 0.002).

Here, we describe the contribution of inertia to future trends. Drawing from thermodynamic principles, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a constant scaling between current rates of world primary energy consumption [Image: see text] and the historical time integral W of past world inflation-adjusted economic production Y, or [Image: see text] . In each year, over a period during which both [Image: see text] and W more than doubled, the ratio of the two remained nearly unchanged, that is [Image: see text] Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. What this near constant implies is that current growth trends in energy consumption, population, and standard of living, perhaps counterintuitively, are determined by past innovations that have improved the economic production efficiency, or enabled use of less energy to transform raw materials into the makeup of civilization. Current observed growth rates agree well with predictions derived from available historical data. Future efforts to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions are likely also to be constrained by the contributions of past innovation to growth. Assuming no further efficiency gains, options look limited to rapid decarbonization of energy consumption through sustained implementation of at least one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, with continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy, one that devotes economic production exclusively to maintining ongoing metabolic needs rather than to material expansion. Even if such actions could be achieved immediately, energy consumption would continue at its current level, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would only begin to balance natural sinks at concentrations exceeding 500 ppmv.","output":"Past world economic production constrains current energy demands: Persistent scaling with implications for economic growth and climate change mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate the effects of the coronavirus epidemic on hospitality industry.

While significant declines in patient volume have been noted, the impact on surgeon decision-making is unclear. Purpose: We sought to investigate changes in pediatric orthopedic trauma care delivery as a result of COVID-19 and determine their implications for future orthopedic practice. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to all members (N = 1515) of the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America (POSNA) in March to April 2021;only members who provided care for pediatric orthopedic trauma patients were asked to complete it. The survey included questions on hospital trauma call, inpatient care, outpatient clinic practice, and 3 unique fracture case scenarios. Results: A total of 147 pediatric orthopedic surgeons completed the survey, for a 9.7% response rate, with 134 (91%) taking trauma call at a hospital as part of their practice. Respondents reported significant differences across institutions regarding COVID-19 testing, hospital rounding, and employee COVID-19 screening.

Door\\\\to\\\\door delivery of HIV testing services (HTS) was one of the main components of the intervention. From an early stage, men were less likely to know their HIV status than women, primarily because they were not home during service delivery. To reach more men, different strategies were implemented during the trial. We present the relative contribution of these strategies to coverage of HTS and the impact of community hubs implemented after completion of the trial among men. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2017, three intervention rounds (IRs) of door\\\\to\\\\door HTS delivery were conducted in eight PopART communities in Zambia. Additional strategies implemented in parallel, included: community\\\\wide Man\\\\up campaigns (IR1), smaller HTS campaigns at work/social places (IR2) and revisits to households with the option of HIV self\\\\testing (HIVST) (IR3). In 2018, community hubs offering HTS were implemented for 7 months in all eight communities. Population enumeration data for each round of HTS provided the denominator, allowing for calculation of the proportion of men tested as a result of each strategy during different time periods. RESULTS: By the end of the three IRs, 65C75% of men were reached with HTS, primarily through door\\\\to\\\\door service delivery. In IR1 and IR2, Man\\\\up and work/social place campaigns accounted for 1 percentage point each and in IR3, revisits with the option of self\\\\testing for 15 percentage points of this total coverage per IR. The yield of newly diagnosed HIV\\\\positive men ranged from 2.2% for HIVST revisits to 9.9% in work/social places. At community hubs, the majority of visitors accepting services were men (62.8%). In total, we estimated that 36% (2.2% tested HIV positive) of men resident but not found at their household during IR3 of PopART accessed HTS provided at the hubs after trial completion. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving high coverage of HTS among men requires universal, home\\\\based service delivery combined with an option of HIVST and delivery of HTS through community\\\\based hubs. When men are reached, they are willing to test for HIV. Reaching men thus requires implementers to adapt their HTS delivery strategies to meet men's needs.

We conducted an interventional trial in DR-TB reference centers in Brazil to evaluate the impact of the use of LPA and Xpert. METHODS: Patients with DR-TB were eligible if their drug susceptibility testing results were available to the treating physician at the time of consultation. The standard reference MGITTM 960 was compared with Xpert (arm 1) and LPA (arm 2). Effectiveness was considered as the start of the appropriate TB regimen that matched drug susceptibility testing (DST) and the proportions of culture conversion and favorable treatment outcomes after 6 months. RESULTS: A higher rate of empirical treatment was observed with MGIT alone than with the Xpert assay (97.0% vs. 45.0%) and LPA (98.2% vs. 67.5%). Patients started appropriate TB treatment more quickly than those in the MGIT group (median 15.0 vs. 40.5 days; p<0.01) in arm 1. Compared to the MGIT group, culture conversion after 6 months was higher for Xpert in arm 1 (90.9% vs. 79.3%, p=0.39) and LPA in arm 2 (80.0% vs. 83.0%, p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: In the Xpert arm, there was a significant reduction in days to the start of appropriate anti-TB treatment and a trend towards greater culture conversion in the sixth month.","output":"Clinical Impact of the Line Probe Assay and Xpert?

However, few clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of self-guided transdiagnostic interventions within a naturalistic setting. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) tests the effectiveness of the video-based transdiagnostic intervention FitMindKit in reducing depression symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety symptoms, disability, and suicidal ideation, relative to an attention-matched control condition called HealthWatch. METHODS: The RCT was conducted with adults living in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Participants (n=1986) were recruited through the web using social media advertisements, screened for psychological distress, and then randomized to receive one of two 4-week programs: FitMindKit (12-module psychotherapy intervention) or HealthWatch (12-module program providing general health information). Participants were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks postbaseline. To maintain the ecological validity of the trial, participants completed brief assessments and interventions without direct researcher contact or incentives. RESULTS: Mixed model repeated-measures analyses of variance demonstrated that FitMindKit significantly improved depression symptoms (F(1,701.7)=3.97; P=.047), along with panic symptoms (F(1,706.5)=5.59; P=.02) and social anxiety symptoms (F(1,680.0)=12.37; P<.001), relative to the attention control condition. There were no significant effects on other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided transdiagnostic interventions can be beneficial when delivered directly to end users through the internet. Despite low adherence and small effect sizes, the availability of such interventions is likely to fill a critical gap in the accessibility of mental health services for the community.

After decades of research, the chemical family of this compound still remains unclear, mainly because structural studies were impaired by the presence of co-extracted compounds in marennine isolates. To improve the purity of marennine extract, we developed a novel extraction method using a graphitic stationary phase, which provides various advantages over the previous procedure using tandem ultrafiltration. Our method is faster, more versatile, provides a better crude yield (66%, compared to 57% for ultrafiltration) and is amenable to upscaling with continuous photobioreactor cultivation. Our goal was to take advantage of the modulable surface properties of the graphitic matrix by optimizing its interactions with marennine. As such, the effects of organic modifiers, pH and reducing agents were studied. With this improvement on marennine purification, we achieved altogether the isolation of a fucoidan-related, sulfated polysaccharide from blue water. Characterization of the polysaccharides fraction suggests that roughly half of UV-absorbing compounds could be isolated from the marennine crude extracts. The identification of sulfated polysaccharides could be a major breakthrough for marennine purification, providing targeted isolation techniques. Likewise, the added value of Haslea ostrearia and the role of polysaccharides in previous marennine chemical characterization and bioactivity studies remain to be determined.","output":"Extraction Improvement of the Bioactive Blue-Green Pigment Marennine from Diatom Haslea ostrearias Blue Water: A Solid-Phase Method Based on Graphitic Matrices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclodextrins (CDs) have long occupied a prominent position in most pharmaceutical laboratories as off-the-shelve tools to manipulate the pharmacokinetics of a broad range of active principles, due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and inclusion abilities.

On the contrary, there is no specific recommendation for the use of statin in patients with non-atherosclerotic stroke, e.g. strokes related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated whether statin treatment in patients with AF-related stroke is associated with improved survival and reduced risk for stroke recurrence and future cardiovascular events. METHODS All consecutive patients registered in the Athens Stroke Registry with AF-related stroke and no history of coronary artery disease nor clinically manifest peripheral artery disease were included in the analysis and categorized in two groups depending on whether statin was prescribed at discharge. The primary outcome was overall mortality; the secondary outcomes were stroke recurrence and a composite cardiovascular endpoint comprising of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm rupture or sudden cardiac death during the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS Among 1602 stroke patients, 404 (25.2%) with AF-related stroke were included in the analysis, of whom 102 (25.2%) were discharged on statin. On multivariate Cox-proportional-hazards model, statin treatment was independently associated with a lower mortality (hazard-ratio (HR): 0.49, 95%CI:0.26-0.92) and lower risk for the composite cardiovascular endpoint during the median 22 months follow-up (HR: 0.44, 95%CI:0.22-0.88), but not with stroke recurrence (HR: 0.47, 95%CI:0.22-1.01, p: 0.053).

We determined the patency rates of the anterior choroidal artery after placement of flow-diversion devices across its ostium. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed a consecutive series of patients in whom a Pipeline Embolization Device was placed across the ostium of an angiographically visible anterior choroidal artery while treating the target aneurysm. Patency of the anterior choroidal artery after Pipeline Embolization Device placement was determined at immediate postoperative and follow-up angiography. Data on pretreatment aneurysm rupture status, concomitant coiling, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, neurologic status at follow-up, and follow-up MR imaging/CT findings were collected. RESULTS Fifteen patients with 15 treated aneurysms were included in this study. In the immediate postprocedural setting, the anterior choroidal artery was patent on posttreatment angiography for all 15 patients. Of the 14 patients with follow-up angiography at least 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device placement, 1 (7%) had occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery and 14 had a patent anterior choroidal artery (93%). No patients had new neurologic symptoms or stroke related to anterior choroidal artery occlusion at follow-up. Of the 9 patients with follow-up CT or MR imaging, none had infarction in the vascular territory of the anterior choroidal artery.

This quarantine could have psychological consequences on general population and vulnerable people such as substances users [1]. Anticipated consequences of behavioral changes related to substance use in context of quarantine have emerged in literature [2]. Changes in substances use could led to an increase of health issues such as mortality due to overdose notably [3]. Some authors suggested that quarantine related to covid-19 pandemic could increase alcohol use [4,5]. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of polysubstance users who have increased their alcohol use and determine risk factors for these changes. Methods: An anonymous Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 8 and May 10, 2020. Participants were recruited via posts and Internet messages on a French online Forum related to drug use (www.psychoactif.org). This website is a forum dedicated to harm reduction and information on psychoactive drugs and lead by volunteers. We included participants that reported at least the use of two substances including alcohol. Only French citizen living on French territories were included Since 30 % of visitors on psychoactif web site are living in others francophone countries, we excluded them, due to different quarantine conditions between countries. Study variables were collected by using a questionnaire designed for the present study. Declarative data from this survey questions included socio demographical informations and questions on quarantine conditions notably number of days of quarantine and quarantine domestic conditions. Participants were asked on questions pertaining to use of alcohol (Since the beginning of the quarantine, have you increased, diminished, quitted or maintained your alcohol consumption). Current alcohol use was examined using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Consumption (AUDIT). Alcohol craving during quarantine was assessed using Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), and Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Hospital Depression and Anxiety scale (HAD). Substances use and medication use were reported. The rates of users were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the associations of demographic or clinical variables with alcohol increase were assessed using odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI from a multivariate logistic regression. Results: 1310 polysubstance users completed the survey. A total of 974 (74.3%, [95%CI, 72.2-76.4]) participants reported alcohol use of whom 405 participants (41.6 %, [IC95 38.5-44.7]) reported an increase in alcohol use since the start of quarantine. Odds of alcohol use increase was higher for participants with married/domestic partnership (OR, 1.8 [95%CI, 1.4- 2.5]), and those with HAD scores higher than 7 (OR, 1.7 [95%CI, 1.2-2.3]), AUDIT scores lower than 8 (OR, 2.0 [95%CI, 1.4-2.8]), and OCDS scores greater than 7(IQR) (OR, 3.2 [95%CI, 2.3 - 4.5]). Odds of alcohol use increase was higher for psychostimulant users (OR, 1.7 [95%CI, 1.3 -2.5]). Conclusion: Prevention on the emergence of alcohol use disorders in light and moderate drinkers during quarantine should be considered by health policies and target specifically polysubstance users who reported psychostimulant use, higher levels of alcohol craving, anxiety and depression.

Mobile health (mHealth)Cbased interventions taking advantage of smartphone technology have shown particular promise in increasing the quality of self-care among these patients, and in turn improving the outcomes of their disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to co-develop with physicians, patients with HF, and their caregivers a patient-oriented mHealth app, perform usability assessment, and investigate its effect on the quality of life of patients with HF and rate of hospitalizations in a pilot study. METHODS: The development of an mHealth app (The Hellenic Educational Self-care and Support Heart Failure app [ThessHF app]) was evidence based, including features based on previous clinically tested mHealth interventions and selected by a panel of HF expert physicians and discussed with patients with HF. At the end of alpha development, the app was rated by mHealth experts with the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The beta version was tested by patients with HF, who rated its design and content by means of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Subsequently, a prospective pilot study (THESS-HF [THe Effect of a Specialized Smartphone app on Heart Failure patients quality of self-care, quality of life and hospitalization rate]) was performed to investigate the effect of app use on patients with HF over a 3-month follow-up period. The primary endpoint was patients quality of life, which was measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L). The secondary endpoints were the European Heart Failure Self-care Behavior Scale (EHFScBS) score and the hospitalization rate. RESULTS: A systematic review of mHealth-based HF interventions and expert panel suggestions yielded 18 separate app features, most of which were incorporated into the ThessHF app. A total of 14 patients and 5 mHealth experts evaluated the app. The results demonstrated a very good user experience (overall PSSUQ score 2.37 [SD 0.63], where 1 is the best, and a median MARS score of 4.55/5). Finally, 30 patients (male: n=26, 87%) participated in the THESS-HF pilot study (mean age 68.7 [SD 12.4] years). A significant increase in the quality of self-care was noted according to the EHFScBS, which increased by 4.4% (SD 7.2%) (P=.002). The mean quality of life increased nonsignificantly after 3 months according to both KCCQ (mean increase 5.8 [SD 15] points, P=.054) and EQ-5D-5L (mean increase 5.6% [SD 15.6%], P=.06) scores. The hospitalization rate for the follow-up duration was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The need for telehealth services and remote self-care management in HF is of vital importance, especially in periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a user-friendly mHealth app to promote remote self-care support in HF. In this pilot study, the use of the ThessHF app was associated with an increase in the quality of self-care.

This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a set of drones are operated in coordination with public transportation system to deliver a set of orders to customer locations. A mathematical model based on Vehicle routing Problem (VRP) is extended to solve this problem. A real-world case inspired by Bremen 2025 transportation paradigm is also developed to validate the developed mathematical formulation. Results show that the sequence of visiting customers and public transport stations highly impacts the remaining charge and efficiency of drone tour planning. Also, using public transport vehicles, which enables drones to charge their battery or to approach customers, can reduce the number of drones required for satisfying the demands in a service area.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic transperitoneal radical nephrectomies for suspected renal tumors were randomized for intact renal specimen extraction via a PFN or EPS incision. Operative, perioperative, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 6 months postoperative parameters were prospectively recorded and analyzed including specimen weight, size in maximum diameter, incision length, total operative time, extraction time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, pain score in the postoperative holding area and on the first post operative day, narcotic consumption, time to fluid intake/full diet intake, unassisted ambulation, cosmesis, and wound-related complications. A postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire was also filled out by all the patients. RESULTS Our series included 51 patients: 26 in the PFN group and 25 in the EPS group. The two groups were similar in demographic characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters apart from a longer PFN incision (P<0.00). First postoperative day pain score was significantly less in the PFN group than in the EPS group (P=0.023). Complication rate was less in the PFN group, although not statistically significant. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the PFN than in the EPS group (P=0.01). Mean cosmesis and operative satisfaction scores at week 1, week 6, and 6 month visits were not significantly different between both groups. Compared with the EPS group, PFN group patients significantly will choose the same operation if they would do it again (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS PFN incision has less morbidity, pain score, and hospital stay compared with EPS incision for intact specimen extraction after transperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. Both incisions are associated with high operative satisfaction, good cosmesis, and a low rate of wound complications.","output":"A Prospective Randomized Study of Pfannenstiel Versus Expanded Port Site Incision for Intact Specimen Extraction in Laparoscopic Radical Nephrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.","output":"Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human nasal epithelial cells in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The relationship between the increases in pulse pressure (PP) and arterial stiffness determined by aging or systemic hypertension has been widely reported. These findings are supported by large-cohort analysis conducted in well-known populations, such as the Framingham Study. However, there is evidence that an age-PP curvilinear relationship may exist in hypertensive subjects. This study aimed to evaluate the age-related change in pulse pressure and arterial stiffness in a population-based study. METHODS: Carotid femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (cfPWV) were obtained in 2075 subjects. RESULTS: Age-related changes of PP showed a curvilinear relationship (R=0.39, p<0.0001) in normotensive subjects, with a nadir at around 50 years of age. On the other hand, the age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.72, p<0.0001). PP also showed a curvilinear relationship with age (R=0.36, p<0.0001) in hypertensive subjects, with a nadir around 50 years of age. The age-cfPWV relationship showed a linear and positive correlation (R=0.55, p<0.0001). Similar results were observed in the adult population (age&#8805;16 years). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, cfPWV, and mean arterial pressure are determinants of PP values in the entire population; however, this result is not uniform when the different subgroups are analyse. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, age-related changes in PP showed a curvilinear relationship and no parallelism with the age-cfPWV relationship for both normotensive and hypertensive subjects.

There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI).ResultsOf 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54-73] years;70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%).ConclusionsPatients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"Psychiatric clinical profiles and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a consultation liaison psychiatry unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory decompensation (CRD) visits have a profound effect on adult emergency departments (EDs). Respiratory pathogens like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common reasons for increased activity in pediatric EDs and are associated with CRD in the adult population. Given the seasonal aspects of such challenging pathology, it would be advantageous to predict their variations. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the increased burden of CRD in adult EDs during flu and bronchiolitis outbreaks in the pediatric population. METHODS: An ecological study was conducted, based on admissions to the adult ED of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) of Grenoble and Saint Etienne from June 29, 2015 to March 22, 2020. The outbreak periods for bronchiolitis and flu in the pediatric population were defined with a decision-making support tool, PREDAFLU, used in the pediatric ED. A Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and a Spearman monotone dependency were performed in order to study the relationship between the number of adult ED admissions for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes related to cardiorespiratory diagnoses and the presence of an epidemic outbreak as defined with PREDAFLU. RESULTS: The increase in visits to the adult ED for CRD and the bronchiolitis and flu outbreaks had a similar distribution pattern (CHU Saint Etienne: (2)(3)=102.7, P<.001; CHU Grenoble: (2)(3)=126.67, P<.001) and were quite dependent in both hospital settings (CHU Saint Etienne: Spearman =0.64; CHU Grenoble: Spearman =0.71). The increase in ED occupancy for these pathologies was also significantly related to the pediatric respiratory infection outbreaks. These 2 criteria gave an idea of the increased workload in the ED due to CRD during the bronchiolitis and flu outbreaks in the pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: This study established that CRD visits and bed occupancy for adult EDs were significantly increased during bronchiolitis and pediatric influenza outbreaks. Therefore, a prediction tool for these outbreaks such as PREDAFLU can be used to provide early warnings of increased activity in adult EDs for CRD visits.","output":"Evaluating the Increased Burden of Cardiorespiratory Illness Visits to Adult Emergency Departments During Flu and Bronchiolitis Outbreaks in the Pediatric Population: Retrospective Multicentric Time Series Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Great progress has been made over the past 18 months in scientific understanding of the biology, epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Extraordinary advances have been made in vaccine development and the execution of clinical trials of possible therapies. However, uncertainties remain, and this review assesses these in the context of virus transmission, epidemiology, control by social distancing measures and mass vaccination and the effect on all of these on emerging variants. We briefly review the current state of the global pandemic, focussing on what is, and what is not, well understood about the parameters that control viral transmission and make up the constituent parts of the basic reproductive number R(0). Major areas of uncertainty include factors predisposing to asymptomatic infection, the population fraction that is asymptomatic, the infectiousness of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals, the contribution of viral transmission of such individuals and what variables influence this. The duration of immunity post infection and post vaccination is also currently unknown, as is the phenotypic consequences of continual viral evolution and the emergence of many viral variants not just in one location, but globally, given the high connectivity between populations in the modern world. The pattern of spread of new variants is also examined. We review what can be learnt from contact tracing, household studies and whole-genome sequencing, regarding where people acquire infection, and how households are seeded with infection since they constitute a major location for viral transmission. We conclude by discussing the challenges to attaining herd immunity, given the uncertainty in the duration of vaccine-mediated immunity, the threat of continued evolution of the virus as demonstrated by the emergence and rapid spread of the Delta variant, and the logistics of vaccine manufacturing and delivery to achieve universal coverage worldwide. Significantly more support from higher income countries (HIC) is required in low- and middle-income countries over the coming year to ensure the creation of community-wide protection by mass vaccination is a global target, not one just for HIC. Unvaccinated populations create opportunities for viral evolution since the net rate of evolution is directly proportional to the number of cases occurring per unit of time. The unit for assessing success in achieving herd immunity is not any individual country, but the world.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: remaining uncertainties in our understanding of the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the virus, and challenges to be overcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to examine the relationships between occupational stressors, mental health problems, and sleep difficulty, and the mediating roles of cognitive fusion and cognitive reappraisal on the relationships in Chinese nurses.

However, it is of pathologic significance that OC43 virus shares DNA sequence homology with the two coronavirus isolates, SK and SD, from the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (3). Probing MS and control brain with probes specific for human, murine, porcine and bovine coronavirus by in situ hybridization resulted in the detection of coronavirus RNA in 12 of 22 MS brain samples; five of which were positive with the OC43 probe (4). A study of virus-ligand interactions of OC43 with human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, which are highly susceptible to virus infection, was undertaken to identify possible cell receptors. The binding of virus collected from the supernatant of infected cells to cell proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose paper was used to screen for virus-ligand interactions. The next step was the identification or development of antibodies to each of the ligands, and to test their ability to blockade receptor activity by culturing infected cells in medium containing the ligand antibodies and measuring the effect on virus yield.

Prepandemic racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of coronavirus-specific forms of discrimination on mental health has not been examined. This study assessed the effect of social determinants of mental health and COVID-19-specific victimization and racial bias beliefs on depression and anxiety among young adults of color in the U.S. METHOD: A national online survey of 399 American Indian/Alaskan Natives, Asian, Black, and Latinx adults (18-25 years) included demographic variables, COVID-19-health risks, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, coronavirus-related victimization distress and perceptions of coronavirus-related racial bias across a range of contexts. RESULTS: Employment, financial and prescription insecurity, COVID-19-health risks, coronavirus-victimization distress and coronavirus racial bias beliefs were positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Scores on the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale were significantly higher among Asian and Black respondents. Structural equation modeling controlling for race/ethnicity and demographic variables indicated coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health indices. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race.

METHODS: Data on all visits to 634 EDs and 60 SOSMed associations were collected daily. COVID-19-related visits were identified using ICD-10 codes after coding recommendations were sent to all ED and SOSMed doctors. The time course of COVID-19-related visits was described by age group and region. During the lockdown period, the characteristics of ED and SOSMed visits and hospitalisations after visits were described by age group and gender. The most frequent diagnoses associated with COVID-19-related visits were analysed. RESULTS: COVID-19 SyS was implemented on 29 February and 4 March for EDs and SOSMed, respectively. A total of 170,113 ED and 59,087 SOSMed visits relating to COVID-19 were recorded, representing 4.0% and 5.6% of the overall coded activity with a peak in late March representing 22.5% and 25% of all ED and SOSMed visits, respectively.

In this paper, we address the dangers posed to societal sustainability. The concern being addressed is the very survival of societies where the rights of individuals, personal and collective freedoms, an independent judiciary and media, and democracy, despite its messiness, are highly valued. We argue that, as a result of various technological innovations, a range of dysfunctional impacts are threatening social and political stability. For instance, robotics and automation are replacing human labor and decision-making in a range of industries; search engines, monetized through advertising, have access to, and track, our interests and preferences; social media, in connecting us to one another often know more about us than we ourselves do, enabling them to profit in ways which may not coincide with our well-being; online retailers have not only acquired the ability to track and predict our buying choices, but also they can squeeze vendors based on their outsize bargaining power; and, in general, virtual technologies have changed both the way we think and our sense of self. With the rising deployment of the Internet of Things, and developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the threats to individual freedoms and rights, societal cohesion and harmony, employment and economic well-being, and trust in democracy are being ratcheted up. This paper lauds the benefits and addresses the harm wrought by the high tech giants in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The search for rapidly growing revenues (and shareholder returns and stock prices) drives firms to accelerate product innovation without fully investigating the entire gamut of their impacts. As greater wealth accrues to the leaders of tech firms, inequalities within firms and societies are widening, creating social tensions and political ferment. We explore the ethical nature of the challenge employing a simple utilitarian calculus, complemented by approaches rooted in rights, justice, and the common good. Various options to address the challenges posed by ICTs are considered and evaluated. We argue that regulation may do little more than slow down the damage to society, particularly since societal values and political preferences vary internationally. Firms need to establish ethical standards, imbuing the upholders of these standards with sufficient authority, while creating a culture of morality.

Nursing students with a higher eHEALS score had a higher likelihood of adhering to hand-washing (odds ratio, OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.22; p < 0.001), mask-wearing (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.19; p < 0.001), keeping a safe physical distance (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.25; p < 0.001), and had a lower anxiety likelihood (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99; p = 0.011). Conclusions: Nursing students who were men and with better ability to pay for medication had higher eHEALS scores. Those with higher eHEALS scores had better adherence to preventive measures, and better psychological health. The development of strategies to improve eHEALS of nursing students may contribute to COVID-19 containment and improve their psychological health.","output":"Predictors of eHealth Literacy and Its Associations with Preventive Behaviors, Fear of COVID-19, Anxiety, and Depression among Undergraduate Nursing Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the greatest clinical challenges of the last decades. Clinical factors associated with severity of the disease remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize Polish patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to evaluate potential prognostic factors of severe course of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the Pulmonology and Allergology Department of the University Hospital in Krakw, Poland. Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

Establishing the safety of new nanoparticle formulations is the first important step on the pathway to clinical translation. We have recently shown that plasma-polymerized nanoparticles (PPNs) are highly efficient nanocarriers and a viable, cost-effective alternative to conventional chemically synthesized nanoparticles. Here, we present the first comprehensive toxicity and biosafety study of PPNs using both established in vitro cell models and in vivo models. Overall, we show that PPNs were extremely well tolerated by all the cell types tested, significantly outperforming commercially available lipid-based nanoparticles (lipofectamine) used at the manufacturers recommended dosage. Supporting the in vitro data, the systemic toxicity of PPNs was negligible in BALB/c mice following acute and repeated tail-vein intravenous injections. PPNs were remarkably well tolerated in mice without any evidence of behavioral changes, weight loss, significant changes to the hematological profile, or signs of histological damage in tissues. PPNs were tolerated at extremely high doses without animal mortality observed at 6000 mg/kg and 48,000 mg/kg for acute and repeated-injection regimens, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the safety of PPNs in biological systems, adding to their future potential in biomedical applications.","output":"Comprehensive Evaluation of the Toxicity and Biosafety of Plasma Polymerized Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on the outcomes of patients undergoing surgery and intervention. This study was conducted between 20 March and 20 May 2020 in six hospitals in Istanbul, and aimed to investigate the effects of surgery and intervention on COVID-19 disease progression, intensive care (ICU) need, mortality and virus transmission to patients and healthcare workers. Patients were examined in three groups: group I underwent emergency surgery, group II had an emergency non-operating room intervention, and group III received inpatient COVID-19 treatment but did not have surgery or undergo intervention. Mortality rates, mechanical ventilation needs and rates of admission to the ICU were compared between the three groups. During this period, patient and healthcare worker transmissions were recorded. In total, 1273 surgical, 476 non-operating room intervention patients and 1884 COVID-19 inpatients were examined. The rate of ICU requirement among patients who had surgery was nearly twice that for inpatients and intervention patients, but there was no difference in mortality between the groups. The overall mortality rates were 2.3% in surgical patients, 3.3% in intervention patients and 3% in inpatients. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction positivity among hospital workers was 2.4%. Only 3.3% of infected frontline healthcare workers were anaesthesiologists. No deaths occurred among infected healthcare workers.

In this context, this paper implements the frequency connectedness approach of Barunik and Krehlik (2018) and to measure short-, medium- and long-term connectedness between realized volatilities of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, this paper analyzes network graphs of directional TO/FROM spillovers before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we examine the volatility connectedness among eight major cryptocurrencies by the virtue of market capitalization by using the frequency connectedness approach over the period July 26, 2017 and October 28, 2020. To this end, this paper computes short-, medium- and long-cycle overall spillover indexes on different frequency bands. All indexes properly capture well-known events such as the 2018 cryptocurrency market crash and COVID-19 pandemic and markedly surge around these incidents. Furthermore, owing to notably increased volatilities after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper concentrates on network connectedness of volatility spillovers for two distinct periods, July 26, 2017-March 10, 2020 and March 11, 2020-October 28, 2020, respectively. In line with the related studies, major cryptocurrencies stand at the epicenter of the connectedness network and directional volatility spillovers dramatically intensify based on the network analysis. Findings Overall spillover indexes have fluctuated between 54% and 92% in May 2018 and April 2020. The indexes gradually escalated till November 9, 2018 and surpassed their average values (71.92%, 73.66% and 74.23%, respectively). Overall spillover indexes dramatically plummeted till January 2019 and reached their troughs (54.04%, 57.81% and 57.81%, respectively). Etherium catalyst the highest sum of volatility spillovers to other cryptocurrencies (94.2%) and is followed by Litecoin (79.8%) and Bitcoin (76.4%) before the COVID-19 announcement, whereas Litecoin becomes the largest transmitter of total volatility (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%). Except for Etherium, the magnitudes of total volatility spillovers from each cryptocurrency notably increase after - COVID-19 announcement period. The medium-cycle network topology of pairwise spillovers indicates that the largest transmitter of total volatility spillover is Litecoin (89.5%) and followed by Bitcoin (89.3%) and Etherium (88.9%) before the COVID-19 announcement. Etherium keeps its leading role of transmitting the highest sum of volatility spillovers (89.4%), followed by Bitcoin (88.9%) and Litecoin (88.2%) after the COVID-19 announcement. The largest transmitter of total volatility spillovers is Etherium (95.7%), followed by Litecoin (81.2%) and Binance Coin (75.5%) for the long-cycle connectedness network in the before-COVID-19 announcement period. These nodes keep their leading roles in propagating volatility spillover in the latter period with the following sum of spillovers (Etherium-89.5%, Bitcoin-88.9% and Litecoin-88.1%, respectively). Research limitations/implications The study can be extended by including more cryptocurrencies and high-frequency data. Originality/value The study is original and contributes to the extant literature threefold. First, this paper identifies connectedness between major cryptocurrencies on different frequency bands by using a novel methodology. Second, this paper estimates volatility connectedness between major cryptocurrencies before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic and thereby to concentrate on its impact on the cryptocurrency market. Third, this paper plots network graphs of volatility connectedness and herewith picture the intensification of cryptocurrencies due to a major financial distress event.","output":"Cryptocurrency connectedness nexus the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from time-frequency domains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has changed childrens eating and physical activity behaviours. These changes have been positive for some households and negative for others, revealing health inequalities that have ramifications for childhood obesity. This study investigates the pandemics impact on families of children aged 2C6 years with overweight or obesity. METHODS: Drawing on interviews conducted as part of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for childhood obesity, thematic analysis was used to examine how parents of pre-schoolers perceived changes in their eating, screentime and physical activity behaviours between the first and second waves of Covid-19. Parents (n = 70, representing 68 families) were interviewed twice during a period of 6 months in three countries with markedly different pandemic policies C Sweden, Romania, and Spain. The analysis is informed by Bronfenbrenners ecological systems theory, which embeds home- and school-based influences within societal and policy contexts. RESULTS: The findings show that, although all participants were recruited from an RCT for families of children with excess weight, they reported different responses to the pandemics second wave, with some children engaging in healthier eating and physical activity, and others engaging in comfort eating and a more sedentary lifestyle. Differences in childrens obesity-related behaviours were closely related to differences in parents practices, which were, in turn, linked to their emotional and social wellbeing. Notably, across all sites, parents feeding and physical activity facilitation practices, as well as their emotional and social wellbeing, were embedded in household resilience. In resilient households, where parents had secure housing and employment, they were better able to adapt to the challenges posed by the pandemic, whereas parents who experienced household insecurity found it more difficult to cope. CONCLUSIONS: As the Covid-19 pandemic is turning into a long-term public health challenge, studies that address household resilience are crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment responses to childhood obesity.

This study aimed to assess the utility of SAFPs, alone or combined with FeNO, to predict a positive MCT in patients in two age groups (<55 and 55 years) with asthma\\\\suggestive symptoms and FEV(1) 80% predicted. METHODS: We enrolled 846 Chinese patients with suspected asthma and standard spirometry, FeNO, and MCT findings. Using the area under the curves (AUCs), the utility of SAFPs, alone or combined with FeNO, for predicting a positive MCT was analyzed in a discovery (n = 534) and validation cohort (n = 312) in both age groups with FEV(1) 80% predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the optimal cut\\\\off values for predicting a positive MCT in patients aged <55 years (74.2% and 74.9% for forced expiratory flow (FEF)(50%) and FEF(25%C75%), respectively) were higher than those in patients aged 55 years (65.0% and 62.9% for FEF(50%), FEF(25%C75%), respectively). However, the optimal FeNO value in patients aged <55 years (43 ppb) was lower than that in patients aged 55 years (48 ppb). FeNO combined with SAFPs (FEF(50%), FEF(25%C75%)) significantly increased the AUCs in both groups (55 years [0.851 for FEF(50%) and 0.844 for FEF(25%C75%)]; <55 years [0.865 for FEF(50%) and 0.883 for FEF(25%C75%)]) compared with a single parameter (p < 0.05). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. Compared with patients 55 years, those aged <55 years had higher and lower optimal cut\\\\off values for SAFPs and FeNO, respectively.

METHOD Participants were parents of children aged 4 to 13 years (n = 45, mean 7.5, SD: 2.6) who participated in the Baltimore Generations Study before the pandemic. They reported on their child's self-regulation (SR) using the Parent Observation of Child Adaptation. During the pandemic, they were recontacted to report on child SR, disruptions to family life (Coronavirus Impact Scale), and parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index). Prepandemic to pandemic changes in SR were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS There were significant decreases in child SR (poorer concentration, attention, task engagement and persistence, and greater impulsivity) prepandemic to pandemic. During the pandemic, parenting stress was correlated with lower child SR (r range = -0.52 to -0.34, p < 0.05). Pandemic-related family disruptions were associated with changes in children's impulsivity (F [1, 42] = 5.28, p = 0.03); children with 4 or more disruptions (67%) showed less ability to wait their turn during the pandemic compared with prepandemic (M [SD] = 3.34 [0.93] vs. 4.41 [1.21], t [28] = 3.93, p < 0.001). There was no change in SR for children with fewer than 4 disruptions. CONCLUSION Results highlight modest pandemic-associated decreases in child attention, task persistence, and task engagement alongside increases in impulsivity. We did not find evidence of broad or severe impacts; however, children whose families have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic may need focused support in school and at home to avoid widening prepandemic health and educational disparities.","output":"Children's Attention and Self-Regulatory Behavior Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background. The lockdown period due to the COVID?19 pandemic has drastically decreased levels of physical activity in the population.

This observational study recruited 27 patients with hemophilia and arthropathy. Knee, ankle and elbow joints were assessed. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis, pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and joint ROM were evaluated. (3) Results. Following lockdown, a significant deterioration of joint condition, perceived joint pain and range of motion was noted in all joints. There were no changes in the frequency of knee hemarthrosis, while the frequency of ankle hemarthrosis significantly reduced. However, the frequency of elbow hemarthrosis increased. Depending on the degree of hemophilia severity, there were changes in pressure pain threshold in the elbow and in pain intensity and range of motion of the ankle joint. According to the type of treatment, i.e., prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment, there were differences in the joint condition in elbows and the plantar flexion movement of the ankle. There were no differences in the knee joint based on the severity of the disease, the type of treatment or the development of inhibitors (4). Conclusions. Because of the COVID?19 lockdown, the musculoskeletal status of patients with hemophilia deteriorated. Joint condition, perceived pain, and range of motion were significantly affected.

It provides a set of findings and recommendations in relation to certain key elements of the Funds lending framework that have important ramifications on SODR processes, namely debt sustainability assessments (DSAs), the exceptional access policy (EAP) for financing above normal access limits, and the criteria for lending to countries with payments arrears to private creditors (LIA) or official bilateral creditors (LIOA). It also considers other indirect channels through which the Fund can affect SODRs, including its support for enhancing the transparency and public disclosure of sovereign debt information, its collaboration with the Paris Club and the G20 debt-related initiatives, the promotion of contractual standards for sovereign debt, and the monitoring of relevant legislative developments.","output":"The IMFs role in sovereign debt restructurings (ECB Occasional Paper No. 2021/262)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 public-health pandemic emergency, it is important to understand its zoonotic origin and how an animal virus finally infects humans.

Probing the host factors contributing to disease severity, we found that lower levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines on hospital admission correlated with faster recovery in 18 patients with A/H7N9 influenza virus, whereas high concentrations of (in particular) IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 were predictive of a less favorable or fatal outcome. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed up to 1,000-fold greater cytokine/chemokine levels relative to plasma. Furthermore, patients with the rs12252-C/C IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genotype had more rapid disease progression and were less likely to survive. Compared with patients with the rs12252-T/T or rs12252-T/C genotype of IFITM3, patients with the C/C genotype had a shorter time from disease onset to the time point when they sought medical aid (hospital admission or antiviral therapy) and a shorter interval to development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome stage (reflected by shorter intervals between clinical onset and methylprednisolone treatments and higher rates of mechanical ventilator use), as well as experiencing elevated/prolonged lung virus titers and cytokine production and higher mortality.

The ability to make an explicit distinction between ancient stressors (AS) and modern stressors (MS) has been reported in young and older adults; AS have been associated with greater ability to cope and MS with poorer health outcomes. Whether these explicit distinctions exist at an implicit, unconscious level, has yet to be determined. DESIGN: A quantitative design employed a computer-based Implicit Association Test (IAT) to examine implicit associations between AS/MS and coping appraisal. METHODS: One hundred adults (75 females) aged 18-58 years (M = 28.27 years, SD = 10.02) completed the AS/MS IAT, to compare reaction time (RT) and accuracy between consistent pairs (AS/ability to cope; MS/inability to cope) and inconsistent pair responses (AS/inability to cope; MS/ability to cope); followed by an explicit self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANCOVAs, controlling for sex and age, revealed significant main effects of faster RT and higher accuracy in responses for consistent than inconsistent pairs. Adult participants made implicit associations indicating an unconscious AS and MS distinction. Using the D algorithm, a univariate ANCOVA and independent t-tests found that males, compared to females, showed a stronger implicit preference for consistent than inconsistent pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest an implicit association between ancient and modern stressors and perceived coping ability.

There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use. Objective: To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures: History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results: A total of 18a?472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12a?725 (69%) were white.

Methods: Demographic, lifestyle, work-related and comorbidities data of 1447 HCWs which underwent a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively collected. For the 164 HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2, data about safety in the workplace, symptoms and clinical course of COVID-19 were also collected. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed using a multivariable Poisson regression. Results: The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the screened HCWs was 11.33 (9.72-13.21).

To study the specific antibody responses would contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19. METHODS: We collected complete follow-up data from 777 patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 with corresponding immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) testing results. RESULTS: Overall, the positive rates of IgG and IgM in severe patients were slightly higher than those in non-severe patients. In addition, higher IgG levels were detected in severe patients compared to non-severe patients (P = 0.026). Through further analysis, differences in IgG were only significant in serum samples taken in the first 14 days of disease onset (P < 0.001). On the basis of analysis of antibody expression levels at different time points in 74 patients who had undergone more than three detection tests, we found that the differences in IgG levels between the severe/non-severe patients were more pronounced than those of IgM. On multivariate logistic regression, after adjusting for cofactors, the higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) IgG levels observed in the first 14 days of disease onset were independently associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.368, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.138C1.645).

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these environments correspond to epidemiological risk from contacts and the social construction of risk by communication within networks of friends. Understanding the circumstances under which the influence of these different social networks can promote the acceptance of non-pharmaceutical interventions and consequently the adoption of protective behaviours is critical for guiding useful, practical public health messaging. METHODS: We explore how information from both physical contact and social communication layers of a multiplex network can contribute to flattening the epidemic curve in a community. Connections in the physical contact layer represent opportunities for transmission, while connections in the communication layer represent social interactions through which individuals may gain information, e.g. messaging friends. RESULTS: We show that maintaining focus on awareness of risk among each individuals physical contacts promotes the greatest reduction in disease spread, but only when an individual is aware of the symptoms of a non-trivial proportion of their physical contacts (~  20%). Information from the social communication layer without was less useful when these connections matched less well with physical contacts and contributed little in combination with accurate information from physical contacts. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maintaining social focus on local outbreak status will allow individuals to structure their perceived social norms appropriately and respond more rapidly when risk increases. Finding ways to relay accurate local information from trusted community leaders could improve mitigation even where more intrusive/costly strategies, such as contact-tracing, are not possible.","output":"Observations and conversations: how communities learn about infection risk can impact the success of non-pharmaceutical interventions against epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) Pandemic, the challenges for appropriate and safe delivery nursing care is becoming main concerns since cancer patients are at high risk to be infected.

We developed a novel spatial model to understand the spatial diffusion of the COVID-19 transmissions in Toronto, specifically, how the disease was transmitted to the surrounding neighbourhoods over time in the study area. We also aimed to create priority-based hotspots to assist with planning an effective control strategy and resource allocation.Methods: In this retrospective analysis of COVID-19 surveillance data, we used COVID-19 cases from January 2020 to July 2021 and the population data of the 2016 census. In the diffusion model, if the observed number of cases in a week in a neighbourhood was more than the average weekly number of cases of all neighbourhoods, it was considered an outbreak event in the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood network was defined based on the first order queen contiguity matrix. The diffusion model includes the neighbourhood network where each node represents the neighbourhoods centroid and connect nodes based on neighbourhood contiguity to its first-order neighbour. Only the first outbreak event was considered in the model. The starting point of the outbreak event was the source, where the path indicates diffusions of the disease in space over time. We also created high, medium, and low priority-based hotspots using the incidence rate and duration of COVID-19 outbreaks in the study area.Findings: The resulting maps show spatiotemporal diffusion of COVID-19, specifically the direction and magnitude of the COVID-19 transmissions in the neighbourhoods of Toronto. The maps also display the dynamics of transmissions across the neighbourhoods. Some affected neighbourhoods did not transmit the disease to any neighbourhood, while a few neighbourhoods transmitted the disease up to a maximum of four neighbourhoods. The results from the hotspot classification method inform that the high priority hotspots were concentrated in the northwestern and northeastern corners of Toronto.Interpretation: In our model, we used useful parameters for tracking the diffusion dynamics of COVID-19, which has identified outbreak sources and diffusion patterns of the disease in Toronto. The findings suggest that early intervention at the outbreak sources would have been critical for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 in the city.

All patients underwent chest CT scanning and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 at hospital presentation. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated to evaluate the performance of CT. Subgroup analyses were also performed based on the geographical distribution of these cases in the province of Henan, China. RESULTS: There were 88 /103 (85%) patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 93% (85-97%), 53% (27-77%), 92% (83-96%), and 42% (18-70%), respectively. Similar results were shown in both geographic regions.

Approximately 250 million new cases of STDs occur each year globally. Currently, only three STDs (human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A, and hepatitis B) are preventable by vaccines. Vaccines for other STDs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, await successful development. Currently, all of these STDs are treated with antibiotics. However, the efficacy of antibiotics is facing growing challenge due to the emergence of bacterial resistance. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches, including the development of vaccines against these STDs, should be explored to tackle this important global public health issue. Mass vaccination could be more efficient in reducing the spread of these highly contagious diseases. Bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) is a potential antigen used to prevent STDs. OMVs are released spontaneously during growth by many Gram-negative bacteria. They present a wide range of surface antigens in native conformation that possess interesting properties such as immunogenicity, adjuvant potential, and the ability to be taken up by immune cells, all of which make them an attractive target for application as vaccines against pathogenic bacteria. The major challenge associated with the use of OMVs is its fragile structure and stability. However, a particulate form of the vaccine could be a suitable delivery system that can protect the antigen from degradation by a harsh acidic or enzymatic environment. The particulate form of the vaccine can also act as an adjuvant by itself. This review will highlight some practical methods for formulating microparticulate OMV-based vaccines for STDs.","output":"Potential Applications of Microparticulate-Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) Vaccine Platform for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs): Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Syphilis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Brain tumors are the second most common neoplasm in the pediatric age. Pesticides may play an etiologic role, but literature results are conflicting. This review provides a systematic overview, meta-analysis, and IARC/WHO consideration of data on parental exposure to pesticides and childhood brain tumors. Methods: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar for literature (1 January 1966C31 December 2020) that assessed childhood brain tumors and parental exposure to pesticides. We undertook a meta-analysis addressing prenatal exposure, exposure after birth, occupational exposure, and residential exposure. A total of 130 case-control investigations involving 43,598 individuals (18,198 cases and 25,400 controls) were included. Results: Prenatal exposure is associated with childhood brain tumors (odds ratio, OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.17C1.49; I(2) = 41.1%). The same occurs after birth exposure (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03C1.45, I(2) = 72.3%) and residential exposure to pesticides (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.11C1.54, I(2) = 67.2%). Parental occupational exposure is only marginally associated with CBT (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.99C1.38, I(2) = 67.0%). Conclusions: There is an association between CBT and parental pesticides exposure before childbirth, after birth, and residential exposure.

In particular, the viruses causing rinderpest, canine distemper, Newcastle disease, measles, and mumps have arguably caused more morbidity and mortality than any other single group of related viruses in history. The impact of these diseases has been dramatically reduced through the use of vaccines in both humans and animals, in combination with depopulation and restrictions on animal movements for diseases such as rinderpest and Newcastle disease. The history of the paramyxoviruses is replete with incorrect reports that complicate their taxonomic classification and confuses assessment of their true ability to cause interspecies infections. The nomenclature of viruses within the family Paramyxoviridae is confusing and fraught with inconsistencies, as individual viruses have variously been named according to their species of origin, geographic sites of discovery, antigenic relationships, or given names related to the diseases that they produce in affected animals or humans. Paramyxovirus virions are pleomorphic, 150C350 nm in diameter. Virions are enveloped, covered with large glycoprotein spikes, and contain a herringbone-shaped helically symmetrical nucleocapsid, approximately 1 m in length and 18 nm (Paramyxovirinae) or 13C14 nm (Pneumovirinae) in diameter.

The evaluation of laboratory findings including coagulation and inflammation parameters may represent a promising approach for early determination of COVID-19 severity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the present study, we aimed to identify laboratory parameters present upon admission in patients with COVID-19 related viral pneumonia and associated with an early in-hospital development of refractory respiratory failure or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring treatment in an intensive care unit. We investigated differences in the C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) between COVID-19 patients who had been transferred to an ICU within two weeks after admission (n = 82) and COVID-19 patients with stable course of the disease (n = 74). RESULTS: Multiple comparisons showed statistically significantly prolonged PT on admission in ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients (14.15 sec, median, CI 95% 13.4  14.9) compared to the stable COVID-19 patients (13.25 sec, median, CI 95% 12.9  13.6) (p-value = .0005). CRP levels upon admission were statistically significantly higher in ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients (132 mg/L, median, CI95% 113  159) compared to the stable COVID-19 patients (51 mg/L, median, CI95% 33  72) (p-value < .0001). On-admission fibrinogen and INR levels did not statistically significantly differ between ICU-transferred COVID-19 patients and stable COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: We suggest that CRP and PT levels present on admission in COVID-19 patients may be used as early prognostic markers of severe pneumonia requiring transfer to ICU.","output":"Prolonged prothrombin time as an early prognostic indicator of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social inequalities in health are known to be influenced by the socioeconomic status of the territory in which people live.

The study area includes the municipalities at the origin of the first Italian epidemic outbreak. Data on COVID-19 patients from the Integrated Datawarehouse for COVID Analysis in Milan were used and matched with aggregate-level data from the National Institute of Statistics Italy (Istat). Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between the census block-level predictors and COVID-19 infection, independently of age, sex, country of birth, and preexisting health conditions. All the variables were significantly associated with the outcome, with different effects before and after the lockdown and according to the province of residence.

For optimal treatment of disease, humans need to study specific features of providing 19 pneumonia in comparison with well-studied ordinary pneumonia. In this article, the authors propose a new approach to identifying these specific features. This method is based on creating dynamic disease models for COVID and non-COVID pneumonia based on Bayesian Network design and Hidden Markov Model architecture and their comparison. We build models using real hospital data. We created a model for automatically identifying the type of pneumonia (COVID-19 or ordinary pneumonia) without special COVID tests. And we created dynamic models for simulation future development of both types of pneumonia. All created models showed high quality.

Since last year many molecular products are available for COVID-19 diagnostics., some of these diagnostics have become commercially available for healthcare workers and clinical laboratories. However, the diagnostic technologies have specific limitations and reported several false-positive and false-negative cases, especially during the early stages of kit development and use. The current article addresses these and other relevant questions important to the medical microbiologists running or aspiring to run COVID diagnostic services using PCR and related technologies. METHODS: In this Systematic Review we follow Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). A total of 258 citations retrieved, among those 77 peer reviewed articles was assessed for eligibility, and 181 studies were excluded. Based on inclusion criteria final data extraction was done. RESULTS: The question of diagnostic dilemma has also been addressed in view of discordant results between assays, inter-test variability, repeat testing requirements in specific settings and inconclusive or indeterminate results. Kit efficiency was satisfactory for all assays and the estimates varied within sample types and technology. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona) viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

It was recently documented that long-term fasting improves metabolic health and enhanced the total antioxidant capacity. The present study investigated the influence of a 10-day fasting on markers of the redox status in 109 subjects. Reducing power, 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation(ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity increased significantly, and indicated an increase of circulating antioxidant levels. No differences were detected in superoxide scavenging capacity, protein carbonyls, and superoxide dismutase when measured at baseline and after 10 days of fasting. These findings were concomitant to a decrease in blood glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides as well as an increase in total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. In addition, the well-being index as well as the subjective energy levels increased, documenting a good tolerability. There was an interplay between redox and metabolic parameters since lipid peroxidation baseline levels (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) affected the ability of long-term fasting to normalize lipid levels. A machine learning model showed that a combination of antioxidant parameters measured at baseline predicted the efficiency of the fasting regimen to decrease LDL levels. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that long-term fasting enhanced the endogenous production of antioxidant molecules, that act protectively against free radicals, and in parallel improved the metabolic health status. Our results suggest that the outcome of long-term fasting strategies could be depending on the baseline values of the antioxidative and metabolic status of subjects.","output":"Interplay between oxidative damage, the redox status, and metabolic biomarkers during long-term fasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We documented 4 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection by nonCvariant of concern strains among healthcare workers in Campinas, Brazil.

A rise by 50% fulfills the criterion for Acute Kidney Injury. We studied the relationship between concentrated urine before surgery, which is usually a sign of chronically low intake of water, and the perioperative change in plasma creatinine. Methods: The creatinine concentration was measured in plasma and urine just before and at 6 h, 1 day, and 2 days after major abdominal surgery in a consecutive series of 181 patients. Receiver operating curve analysis was used to find the optimal cut-off to separate concentrated from diluted urine. Results: Urine creatinine of 11.3 mmol/L before the surgery started was exceeded in one third of the patients and associated with greater increase in plasma creatinine at 6 h (median 21 vs. 10%) and at 1 day postoperatively (21 vs. 7%; P < 0.0001). Elevation of plasma creatinine of >25% occurred in 41% and 19% in those with high and low urine creatinine, respectively (P < 0.001) and an increase by >50% in 16% and 10% (P = 0.27). Patients with high urine creatinine before surgery failed to further concentrate their urine during the perioperative period, which is normally associated with intensified renal fluid conservation. Conclusion: High urinary concentration of creatinine before surgery should be considered as a risk factor for postoperative elevation of plasma creatinine.

A multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR was developed that detects pirA, pirB, and two internal control genes, the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes in a single reaction. The pirB primers amplify the 3'-end of the pirB gene allowing the detection of Vibrio spp. mutants that contain a complete deletion of pirA and the partial deletion of pirB.

However, manufacturers often provide diagnostic accuracy data generated through biased studies and the performance in clinical practice is essentially unclear. OBJECTIVES We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of various serological testing strategies for (a) identification of patients with previous coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and (b) prediction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in real-life clinical settings. METHODS We prospectively included 2'573 consecutive health-care workers and 1'085 inpatients with suspected or possible previous COVID-19 at a Swiss University Hospital. Various serological immunoassays based on different analytical techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA; chemiluminescence immunoassay, CLIA; electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, ECLIA; lateral-flow immunoassay, LFI), epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid, N; receptor-binding domain, RBD; extended RBD, RBD+; S1 or S2 domain of the spike [S] protein, S1/S2), and antibody subtypes (IgG, pan-Ig) were conducted. A positive real-time PCR test from a nasopharyngeal swab was defined as previous COVID-19. Neutralization assays with live SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a subgroup of patients to assess neutralization activity (n=201). RESULTS The sensitivity to detect patients with previous COVID-19 was 85% in anti-N ECLIA (86.8%) and anti-S1 ELISA (86.2%). Sensitivity was 84.7% in anti-S1/S2 CLIA, 84.0% in anti-RBD+ LFI, 81.0% in anti-N CLIA, 79.2% in anti-RBD ELISA, and 65.6% in anti-N ELISA. The specificity was 98.4% in anti-N ECLIA, 98.3% in anti-N CLIA, 98.2% in anti-S1 ELISA, 97.7% in anti-N ELISA, 97.6% in anti-S1/S2 CLIA, 97.2% in anti-RBD ELISA, and 96.1% in anti-RBD+ LFI. The sensitivity to detect neutralizing antibodies was 85% in anti-S1 ELISA (92.7%), anti-N ECLIA (91.7%), anti-S1/S2 CLIA (90.3%), anti-RBD+ LFI (87.9%), and anti-RBD ELISA (85.8%). Sensitivity was 84.1% in anti-N CLIA, and 66.2% in anti-N ELISA. The specificity was 97% in anti-N CLIA (100%), anti-S1/S2 CLIA (97.7%), and anti-RBD+ LFI (97.9%). Specificity was 95.9% in anti-RBD ELISA, 93.0% in anti-N ECLIA, 92% in anti-S1 ELISA, and 65.3% in anti-N ELISA. Diagnostic accuracy measures were consistent among subgroups.

This study investigated whether BCG alters all-cause infectious disease morbidity in healthy infants in a different high-mortality setting, and explored whether the changes are mediated via trained innate immunity. METHODS: This was an investigator-blind, randomised, controlled trial done at one hospital in Entebbe, Uganda. Infants who were born unwell (ie, those who were not well enough to be discharged directly home from the labour ward because they required medical intervention), with major congenital malformations, to mothers with HIV, into families with known or suspected tuberculosis, or for whom cord blood samples could not be taken, were excluded from the study. Any other infant well enough to be discharged directly from the labour ward was eligible for inclusion, with no limitation on gestational age or birthweight. Participants were recruited at birth and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard dose BCG 1331 (BCG-Danish) on the day of birth or at age 6 weeks (computer-generated randomisation, block sizes of 24, stratified by sex). Investigators and clinicians were masked to group assignment; parents were not masked. Participants were clinically followed up to age 10 weeks and contributed blood samples to one of three immunological substudies. The primary clinical outcome was physician-diagnosed non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence. Primary immunological outcomes were histone trimethylation at the promoter region of TNF, IL6, and IL1B; ex-vivo production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1, IL-10, and IFN after heterologous stimulation; and transferrin saturation and hepcidin levels. All outcomes were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population of all randomly assigned participants except those whose for whom consent was withdrawn. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (#59683017). FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2014, and July 31, 2015, 560 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive BCG at birth (n=280) or age 6 weeks (n=280). 12 participants assigned to receive BCG at birth and 11 participants assigned to receive BCG at age 6 weeks were withdrawn from the study by their parents shortly after randomisation and were not included in analyses. During the first 6 weeks of life before the infants in the delayed vaccination group received BCG vaccination, physician-diagnosed non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence was lower in infants in the BCG at birth group than in the delayed group (98 presentations in the BCG at birth group vs 129 in the delayed BCG group; hazard ratio [HR] 071 [95% CI 053C095], p=0023). After BCG in the delayed group (ie, during the age 6C10 weeks follow-up), there was no significant difference in non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence between the groups (88 presentations vs 76 presentations; HR 110 [087C140], p=062). BCG at birth inhibited the increase in histone trimethylation at the TNF promoter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurring in the first 6 weeks of life.

No clear effect of BCG on ex-vivo production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1, IL-10, and IFN after heterologous stimulation, or transferrin saturation and hepcidin concentration, was detected (geometric mean ratios between 068 and 168; p0038 for all comparisons). INTERPRETATION: BCG vaccination protects against non-tuberculous infectious disease during the neonatal period, in addition to having tuberculosis-specific effects. Prioritisation of BCG on the first day of life in high-mortality settings might have significant public-health benefits through reductions in all-cause infectious morbidity and mortality.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a newer procedure being done with increasing frequency. Randomized comparisons of LSG and other bariatric procedures are limited. We present the results of the first prospective randomized trial comparing LSG and RYGB in the Polish population. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of LSG versus RYGB in the treatment of morbid obesity and obesity-related comorbidities. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-two morbidly obese patients were randomized to RYGB (36 patients) or LSG (36 patients). Both groups were comparable regarding age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. The follow-up period was at least 12 months. Baseline and 6 and 12 month outcomes were analyzed including assessment of percent excess weight lost (%EWL), reduction in BMI, morbidity (minor, major, early and late complications), mortality, reoperations, comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies. RESULTS There was no 30-day mortality and no significant difference in major complication rate (0% after RYGB and 8.3% after LSG, p > 0.05) or minor complication rate (16.6% after RYGB and 10.1% after LSG, p > 0.05). There were no early reoperations after RYGB and 2 after LSG (5.5%) (p > 0.05). Weight loss was significant after RYGB and LSG but there was no difference between both groups at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. At 12 months %EWL in RYGB and LSG groups reached 64.2% and 67.6% respectively (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of comorbidities and nutritional deficiencies. CONCLUSIONS Both LSG and RYGB produce significant weight loss at 6 and 12 months after surgery. The procedures are equally effective with regard to %EWL, reduction in BMI and amelioration of comorbidities at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB are comparably safe techniques with no significant differences in minor and major complication rates at 6 and 12 months.","output":"Prospective randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for the management of patients with morbid obesity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a new method for estimating the effective reproduction number of an infectious disease (R) and apply it to track the dynamics of COVID-19.

A large number of RTIs is caused by viruses, often resulting in more severe disease in infants, elderly and the immunocompromised. Upon viral infection, most individuals experience common cold-like symptoms associated with an upper RTI. However, in some cases a severe and sometimes life-threatening lower RTI may develop. Reproducible and scalable in vitro culture models that accurately reflect the human respiratory tract are needed to study interactions between respiratory viruses and the host, and to test novel therapeutic interventions. Multiple in vitro respiratory cell culture systems have been described, but the majority of these are based on immortalized cell lines. Although useful for studying certain aspects of viral infections, such monomorphic, unicellular systems fall short in creating an understanding of the processes that occur at an integrated tissue level. Novel in vitro models involving primary human airway epithelial cells and, more recently, human airway organoids, are now in use. In this review, we describe the evolution of in vitro cell culture systems and their characteristics in the context of viral RTIs, starting from advances after immortalized cell cultures to more recently developed organoid systems. Furthermore, we describe how these models are used in studying virus-host interactions, e.g. tropism and receptor studies as well as interactions with the innate immune system.

We postulate two hypotheses on how successful (i.e., disruptive) trolling varies according to context: that trolls messaging strategies appear in different frequencies in political and interest forums (H1), and that context-matching strategies also produce longer futile conversations (H2). Using Hardakers categorization of trolling strategies on a covertCovert continuum, our statistical analysis on a dataset of 49 online conversations verified H1: in political forums covert strategies were more common than overt ones; in interest forums the opposite was the case.

Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of &#8804; 7 , 8 to 10, and &#8805; 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean  SD age was 30  3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

Few countries have systematically investigated ethnic variations in infection. METHODS: We linked the Scotland 2001 Census, including ethnic group, to national databases of hospitalizations/deaths and serological diagnoses of bloodborne viruses for 2001-2013. We calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) in 12 ethnic groups for all infections combined, 15 infection categories, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses. RESULTS: We analysed over 1.65 million infection-related hospitalisations/deaths. Compared with White Scottish, RRs for all infections combined were 0.8 or lower for Other White British, Other White and Chinese males and females, and 1.2-1.4 for Pakistani and African males and females. Adjustment for socioeconomic status or birthplace had little effect. RRs for specific infection categories followed similar patterns with striking exceptions. For HIV, RRs were 136 in African females and 14 in males; for HBV, 125 in Chinese females and 59 in males, 55 in African females and 24 in males; and for HCV, 2.3-3.1 in Pakistanis and Africans.

As a main transmission route, human infection can be acquired by the ingestion of T. gondii oocysts from the environment (e.g., soil, water, fruits and vegetables). Regarding the detection of T. gondii oocysts in environmental samples, the development of a time-saving, cost-effective and highly sensitive technique is crucial for the surveillance, prevention and control of toxoplasmosis. In this study, we developed a new method by combining recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) with CRISPR-Cas12a, designated as the RAA-Cas12a-Tg system. Here, we compared this system targeting the 529 bp repeat element (529 bp-RE) with the routine PCR targeting both 529 bp-RE and ITS-1 gene, respectively, to assess its ability to detect T. gondii oocysts in soil samples. Our results indicated that the 529 bp RE-based RAA-Cas12a-Tg system was able to detect T. gondii successfully in nearly an hour at body temperature and was more sensitive than the routine PCR assay. The sensitivity of this system reached as low as 1 fM with high specificity. Thus, RAA-Cas12a-Tg system provided a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for point-of-care detection of T. gondii oocysts in soil, which will facilitate the control of T. gondii infection in humans and animals.","output":"RAA-Cas12a-Tg: A Nucleic Acid Detection System for Toxoplasma gondii Based on CRISPR-Cas12a Combined with Recombinase-Aided Amplification (RAA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Recent evidence suggests a multilevel inflammatory syndrome as a driving factor in some of the most severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients with overlapping features to other hyperinflammatory or autoimmune diseases.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retropsective case-control study of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients treated with plasma exchange at Heidelberg University Hospital between March and December 2020. Plasma exchangeCtreated patients were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 patients on standard therapy matched for age, gender, disease severity, and features of hyperinflammatory syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Mortality rate and course of clinical and laboratory parameters in response to plasma exchange were assessed in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and in patients on standard care. A plasma volume of 50 mL per kg body weight or a maximum of 4 L was exchanged. RESULTS: In total, 28 critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated with a median of three plasma exchange procedures per patient. No relevant complications occurred during plasma exchange therapy. Inflammatory and biochemical markers of end-organ damage and endothelial activation were significantly reduced following plasma exchange together with normalization of body temperature, improved pulmonary function, and reduced vasopressor demand. Most importantly, these improvements were maintained after the last plasma exchange. In contrast, no such effects were observed in the control group, although baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were comparable. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed improved 30-day survival in the plasma exchange group compared with the control group (67.9% vs 42.9%; p = 0.044). In a multivariable analysis, the hazard ratio for death was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.11C0.68; p = 0.005) with plasma exchange versus standard care.

We sought to determine predictors of hypoxemia and related adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the two largest hospitals in Jerusalem, Israel, from 9 March through 16 July 2020. Patients were categorized as those who developed reduced (<94%) vs. preserved (94%) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) within the first 48 h after arrival to the emergency department. Overall, 492 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with reduced SpO(2) were significantly older, had more comorbidities, higher body surface area (BSA) and body mass index (BMI), lower lymphocyte counts, impaired renal function, and elevated liver enzymes, c-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer levels as compared to those with preserved SpO(2). In the multivariable regression analysis, older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.02 per year, p < 0.001), higher BSA (OR 1.16 per 0.10 m(2), p = 0.003) or BMI (OR 1.05 per 1 kg/m(2), p = 0.011), lower lymphocyte counts (OR 1.72 per 1  10(3)/L decrease, p = 0.002), and elevated CRP (1.11 per 1 mg/dL increase, p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of low SpO(2).

Scientific data and numerous reports show that food waste is a growing trend that has an impact on all stages of the agri-food chain. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how the Covid-19 pandemic has influenced consumer food habits, routines and wasteful behaviour at household level, appearing to show that increases in food waste ceased during lockdown. The authors propose Design Thinking (DT) not simply as a problem-solving approach but as a creative methodology by which the virtuous practices acquired by individuals to avoid food waste during lockdown might be maintained. This article supports the thesis that by applying DT it is possible to devise awareness-raising solutions aimed at encouraging the final consumer to maintain the good food management practices acquired during lockdown, in the long term. To support this hypothesis, two promising pre-pandemic awareness-raising campaigns put forward by design thinkers and practitioners to reduce food waste at consumer level will be discussed. Both initiatives confirm that the degree of awareness, understanding and assimilation of the ethical attitudes related to food waste can lead to long-term behavioural changes, bringing about a transition to desirable, feasible, viable, sustainable and responsible behaviour. Purpose Food waste has been acknowledged as one of the main issues undermining the sustainability of our world, which is why its reduction has been included among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Furthermore, some studies have begun to link the concepts of food waste and food security with sustainable food consumption, suggesting that if individuals reduce their food waste, they can improve their food habits, health and that of the community while contributing to the achievement of several SDGs. However, to date few studies have foregrounded the existence of a concrete connection between food waste initiatives and consumer awareness, and few scholarly articles have focused on design thinking and waste, including food waste during the pandemic, a gap which the present article seeks to fill. Findings The results should inform an improved understanding of how empathy and creativity, two of the main determinants of the design thinking approach, can be used to promote and maintain sustainable food behaviours and ultimately reduce food waste among consumers by designing new food experiences. Originality/value This study has a very original and multi-disciplinary approach. Indeed, in order to reduce food waste, if uses a design thinking approach, for the first time in literature, to enhance the engagement of individuals in fighting food waste.","output":"Learning from and designing after pandemics.

Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was administered in collaboration with ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors Association, consisting of questions about (1) demographics, (2) thyroid cancer clinical characteristics, (3) attitudes toward and impact of COVID-19, and (4) the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29-item profile. The survey was linked on the ThyCa homepage. PROMIS measures were scored using item response theory models with a T-score metric relative to U.S. reference data via the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.healthmeasures.net). T-scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearmans rank correlation tests. Results: From 5/6/2020 - 10/8/2020, 505 participants accessed the survey, and all completed surveys by U.S.-based thyroid cancer survivors were analyzed (n=378, 75%). Mean age was 53 years, 89% were female, 90% were white, 74% had papillary thyroid cancer, 97% had surgery, and 70% received radioactive iodine. The vast majority agreed or strongly agreed (83%) that their lives were very different during COVID-19, as was the way they interacted with their doctors (79%). Less than half (43%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the amount of information from their doctors office regarding COVID-19 changes. Compared to previously-published PROMIS data for this population, T-scores were significantly higher in the domain of anxiety/fear (57.8 vs. 56.5, p&amp;lt;0.01) and lower for ability to participate in social roles and activities (46.2 vs. 48.1, p&amp;lt;0.01).

Patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. We recruited 300 patients; males comprised 50.7% of the sample. A higher proportion of patients with non-urgent cases visited the ER three to four times a year (P=0.001). A higher proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to visit an outpatient clinic before the ER (P=0.003). Most patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult in case of illness. Most patients who visited the ER were single, < 15 years, and had lower incomes. Patients requested ER services for primary care-treatable conditions because of limited services and resources as well as limited working hours at PHCCs. Most patients (90.0%) were knowledgeable about PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable. Patients reported long ER waiting times ( 3 hours), no organization (85.9%), and lack of medical staff. Overall, overuse of ER services is high at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah. The risk factors for ER overuse are age < 15 years, singlehood, and low incomes. Policy makers and health providers have a challenging task to control ER overuse.

Among RAS components, renin, its precursor (pro)renin and its specific receptor (PRR) have been less investigated, particularly in the brain. We previously showed the presence of PRR in neurons and glial cells in the nigrostriatal system of rodents and primates, including humans. Now, we used rat and mouse models and cultures of BV2 and primary microglial cells to study the role of PRR in microglial pro-inflammatory responses. PRR was upregulated in the nigral region, particularly in microglia during the neuroinflammatory response. In the presence of the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker losartan, to exclude angiotensin-related effects, treatment of microglial cells with (pro)renin induces the expression of microglial pro-inflammatory markers, which is mediated by upregulation of NADPH-oxidase and Rho-kinase activities, downregulation of autophagy and upregulation of inflammasome activity.

Among them are molecular markers, amplification and sequencing of nucleic acids. The latter is classified into three generations. The first allows to sequence small DNA fragments. The second one increases throughput, reducing turnaround and pricing, and is therefore more convenient to sequence full genomes and transcriptomes. The third generation is currently pushing technology to its limits, being able to sequence single molecules, without previous amplification, which was previously impossible. Besides, this represents a new revolution, allowing researchers to directly sequence RNA without previous retrotranscription. These technologies are having a significant impact on different areas, such as medicine, agronomy, ecology and biotechnology. Additionally, the study of biomolecules is revealing interesting evolutionary information. That includes deciphering what makes us human, including phenomena like non-coding RNA expansion. All this is redefining the concept of gene and transcript. Basic analyses and applications are now facilitated with new genome editing tools, such as CRISPR.

The present study aimed to assess the association between steroid therapy and quantitative CT parameters in a longitudinal cohort with COVID-19. METHODS: Between February 7 and February 17, 2020, 72 patients with severe COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled. All 300 chest CT scans from these patients were collected and classified into five stages according to the interval between hospital admission and follow-up CT scans: Stage 1 (at admission); Stage 2 (3C7 days); Stage 3 (8C14 days); Stage 4 (15C21 days); and Stage 5 (22C31 days). QCT was performed using a threshold-based quantitative analysis to segment the lung according to different Hounsfield unit (HU) intervals. The primary outcomes were changes in percentage of compromised lung volume (%CL, ? 500 to 100 HU) at different stages. Multivariate Generalized Estimating Equations were performed after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of 72 patients, 31 patients (43.1%) received steroid therapy. Steroid therapy was associated with a decrease in %CL (? 3.27% [95% CI, ? 5.86 to ? 0.68, P = 0.01]) after adjusting for duration and baseline %CL. Associations between steroid therapy and changes in %CL varied between different stages or baseline %CL (all interactions, P < 0.01). Steroid therapy was associated with decrease in %CL after stage 3 (all P < 0.05), but not at stage 2. Similarly, steroid therapy was associated with a more significant decrease in %CL in the high CL group (P < 0.05), but not in the low CL group. CONCLUSIONS: Steroid administration was independently associated with a decrease in %CL, with interaction by duration or disease severity in a longitudinal cohort.

Methods: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). Results: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 ( p <0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854.

Some 15 years ago, the discussion was focused on the backlog problem. Other issues have been regularly debated since then, including the risk of error, need for independence, importance and risk of contextualisation, increasing fragmentation into separate processes and specialisations. Proposed solutions to solve one problem often led to other issues in other parts of the process. This paper attempts to address the apparent crisis using a different perspective, through a comparison with established disciplines, namely material science, medicine and historical science. The comparison with material science shows that, despite the varied organisational and legal models and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, a common element to all forensic science endeavours exists: the trace. A greater focus on the trace might thus help the development of a holistic approach in forensic science. The comparison with medicine demonstrates that, through the overall process, the main risk shifts from the risk to overlook important hypotheses or traces at the beginning of the process (e.g. problems in the detection of traces/symptoms and formulation of hypotheses) to the risk of supporting the wrong hypothesis at the end of the process (e.g. erroneous test of the hypotheses/diagnostic). Further, in medicine, symptoms are rarely evaluated in isolation, while traces are often evaluated separately. By analogy, epidemiology illustrates forensic science's critical role in preventing crime through forensic intelligence, supporting a more extensive and more collaborative application of forensic science in security issues. The comparison with historical science also indicates that a single trace (i.e. the observed effect) is rarely sufficient to reason on its cause. Retrodiction (abduction) is proposed as an alternative reasoning approach to reconstruct events from the past based on signs uncovered in the present. Finally, the impact of science in investigating crimes is presented as an evolving process. A new trace or information can bring an entirely different light on the reconstruction of past events or prevention of future issues. Thus, issues or challenges in the first stages of the process (i.e., crime scene investigation) should be addressed in priority for subsequent stages to function correctly.","output":"A different perspective on the forensic science crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous reports and reviews on the complications caused by the disease, analyzing the acute and chronic consequences. The main symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are dry cough, fever, and fatigue. COVID-19 appears to affect all systems, including renal, cardiovascular, circulatory, and respiratory systems, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report on a 14-year-old male adolescent, who presented with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 92  10(9) /L) and leukopenia (white blood count 4.2  10(3) /L) that was observed two months ago. Ten days before the first blood test, a viral infection with nasal congestion and runny nose was reported, without other accompanying symptoms. Viral antibodies screening revealed positivity for all the three specific COVID-19 antibodies. Further haematological evaluation with bone marrow aspiration revealed non-specific dysplastic features of the red cell and megakaryocyte progenitors. Although haematological alterations due to COVID-19 infection are available from adult patients reports, the effect of COVID-19 infection in the pediatric population is underestimated and this is the first case with such haematological involvement. Noteworthy, in the current case, the impact of the COVID-19 infection was not related to the severity of the disease, as the symptoms were mild. In similar cases, bone marrow aspiration would not be performed as a part of routine work-up. Thus, it is important when evaluating pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection to search and report those alterations in order to better understand the impact and the spectrum of clinical manifestations of the specific viral infection in children and adolescents.","output":"A Case of COVID-19-Related Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia in an Adolescent with Mild Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks has become a serious problem, as the virus may mutate and reinfect humans; some countries have decided to cull minks.

Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, end-intervention (12 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks) to assess changes in moderate intensity self-managed PA, psychological well-being, and social connectedness. We will also measure health service utilization and costs as well as PA choices across the intervention period. End-intervention interviews will capture participant experiences. RESULTS: Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human research activities in Australia, participant recruitment will commence when it is safe and feasible to do so.

All State aid is to a certain extent discriminatory because it selectively favours certain undertakings over others which are incomparable situations. The question is how much discrimination is allowed under Article 107(2) and (3) TFEU, especially when Member States limit the number of eligible undertakings. The General Court has ruled that Member States are not obliged to grant State aid to any or all companies. They may limit the circle of beneficiaries. However, Member States may only grant aid that is appropriate for the objective it aims to achieve, necessary and proportionate for that purpose. This article argues that limiting the aid according to the extent of the links of the beneficiaries to the local economy appears to be a good proxy for the effectiveness of the aid, but it may also be disproportionately discriminatory because such links do not necessarily ensure that the beneficiaries actually contribute more to the local economy than non-beneficiaries or that they actually need the aid more than non-beneficiaries. Appropriately designed aid measures can reduce the degree of discrimination, by applying consistently and systematically objectively justified criteria, without compromising the effectiveness of the aid or forcing Member States to grant more aid than they can afford. The recent Court cases have exposed the hitherto unidentified conflict between the discretion of Member States to grant State aid only to a single or a few undertakings and the need to avoid disproportionate discrimination. ? 2021, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

I use detailed household data extracted from the 2020 American National Election Study in order to gauge media consumption patterns, coupled with data on media bias scores for different outlets and programmes. I combine these variables to compute media bias exposure values for each respondent, and relate these to the likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test within each respondents household, controlling for a variety of other factors including partisanship, social media use, trust in the media and several socioeconomic and demographic variables. The results indicate that media bias exposure is significantly related to COVID-19 incidence, and in particular the coefficients show that a 1% increase in exposure to left-wing media is associated with a 0.2% decrease in the probability of a positive COVID-19 test. Conversely, I find no significant relationship between right-wing media exposure and COVID-19 infection rates.

The objective of this study was to relationship between the biomarkers and HRCT findings. Materials and Method: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out in the COVID-19 suspected isolation unit of a tertiary hospital. Data were collected from electronic medical record (EMR). Relationship test were done by t-test and one-way-ANOVA test. Results: Total 123 cases were enrolled after matching with selection criterion.

Extended care has been shown to improve outcomes. Examining use patterns for longer term programmes can quantify resource requirements and identify opportunities for improving retention. METHODS We analyse 38 094 primary care treatment episodes from a multisite smoking cessation programme in Ontario, Canada that provides free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counselling. We calculate distributional measures of weeks of NRT used, clinical visits attended and total length of care. We then divide treatment courses into four exclusive categories and fit a multinomial logistic regression model to measure associations with participant characteristics, using multiple imputation to address missing data. RESULTS Time in treatment (median=50 days), visits (median=3) and weeks NRT used (median=8) were well below the maximum available. Of all programme enrolments, 28.8% (95% CI=28.3% to 29.3%) were single contacts, 31.3% (30.8% to 31.8%) lasted <12 weeks, 19.2% (18.8% to 19.6%) were 12 weeks with an 8-week interruption and 20.7% (20.3%-21.1%) were 12 weeks without interruptions. Care use was most strongly associated with participant age and whether the nicotine patch was dispensed at the first visit. CONCLUSION Treatment use results imply that the marginal costs of extending treatment programmes are relatively low. The prevalence of single contacts supports additional engagement efforts at the initial visit, while interruptions in care highlight the ability of longer term care to address relapse. Results show that use of the nicotine patch is associated with retention in care, and that improving engagement of younger patients should be a priority.","output":"Treatment use patterns in a large extended-treatment tobacco cessation program: predictors and cost implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper shows how a strategy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions combined with economic cycles can lead to particular consumption behaviours.

In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. Significance Coronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century.

Furthermore, our test can distinguish between fractions of the same spike protein. This is done by an altered assay design with four test line locations where each antigen builds a unique, identifiable binding pattern. The effect of several factors, such as running media, immunoprobe concentration, and antigen interference, is considered. We find that running media has a significant effect on the final binding pattern where human saliva provides results while human serum leads to the lowest signal quality.","output":"Developing a Paper-Based Antigen Assay to Differentiate between Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Competitiveness is a central issue of a growing open, interconnected and integrated global economy, but it is not yet uniquely defined. There are many factors that determine competitiveness, and they change with the development of globalization, and even today, under the conditions of Industry 4.0. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has also provoked a situation in which both policies to foster competitiveness need to be adapted. In order to achieve competitiveness, countries must create factors and develop policies that will create the conditions for better positioning in the global market. In order to successfully integrate into new markets, but at the same time highlight and continue economic development, reevaluation of competitiveness determinants, as well as past positioning strategies, is necessary.

METHOD: We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n = 7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n = 97 LFA + individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titres during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titres, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 d. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","output":"Two-tiered SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion screening in the Netherlands and stability of nucleocapsid, spike protein domain 1 and neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kasus COVID-19 di Indonesia hingga bulan Juli 2021 mengalami peningkatan dan mencapai tahapan Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat Level 4 di berbagai wilayah Indonesia.

It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used 31 426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years). RESULTS: Among 31 426 antibody test results (19 797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30 232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = ?0.45, P < .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P < .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = ?0.51; P < .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P < .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P < .001). Adolescents also exhibited higher median (IQR) TAb levels, IgG levels, and SNAb activity than young adults (eg, TAb levels: 961 [290-2074] RFU vs 370 [125-697]; P = .006). In addition, children had higher antibody binding avidity compared with young adults, but the difference was not significant.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for any data regarding the use of NATEM in several clinical settings. A systematic review of PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted through 20 January 2022 for studies evaluating the use of the NATEM assay in different clinical settings. The literature search yielded a total of 47 publications, 30 of which met the eligibility criteria for this review. Evaluation of NATEMs detecting ability for hemostasis disorders is limited in the literature. The results of the included studies indicate that NATEM seems to be a sensitive method for the detection of hyperfibrinolysis and may have an advantage in the diagnosis of hemostatic disorders. It could be more informative than the other ROTEM assays for detecting changes in coagulation parameters in patients who receive anticoagulants. However, the reported outcomes are highly varying among the included studies. NATEM has a high sensitivity to detect hypo- or hypercoagulability and provides a detailed insight into the whole hemostatic process from clot formation to clot breakdown. It could be a useful technique in variable fields of medicine, not only in adults, but also in pediatric and neonatal populations, to guide different hemostatic treatments and predict coagulation disorders or mortality/morbidity; this issue remains to be further investigated.","output":"The Non-Activated Thromboelastometry (NATEM) Assays Application among Adults and Neonatal/Pediatric Population: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background In a classic epidemic, the infected population has an early exponential phase, before slowing and fading to its peak. Mitigating interventions may change the exponent during the rising phase and a plateau can replace a peak. With interventions comes the risk that relaxation causes a second-wave. In the UK Covid-19 epidemic, infections cannot be counted, but their influence is seen in the curve of the mortality data. This work simulated social distancing and the lockdown in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to explore strategies for relaxation. Methods Cumulative mortality data was transposed 20 days earlier to identify three doubling periods separated by the 17th March - social distancing, and 23rd March - lockdown. A set of stochastic processes simulated viral transmission between interacting individuals using Covid-19 incubation and illness durations. Social distancing and restrictions on interactions were imposed and later relaxed. Principal Findings Daily mortality data, consistent with that seen in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to 24th April 2020 was simulated. This output predicts that under a lockdown maintained till early July 2020, UK deaths will exceed 31,000, but leave a large susceptible population and a requirement for vaccination or quarantine. An earlier staged relaxation carries a risk of a second-wave. The model allows exploration of strategies for lifting the lockdown.

Elucidating the physico-chemical parameters that modulate phase separation is crucial in order to understand its effects in health and disease, as well as to develop therapeutic strategies that target biomolecular condensate systems. Phase behaviour is described by the phase diagram that defines conditions at which distinct phases exist, as well as the boundaries between these phases. Phase diagrams are typically built up from numerous individual measurements sampling different parts of the phase space. For biomolecular condensates, this process is slow, low throughput and associated with significant sample consumption even when performed in microwell format. Due to the rapidly increasing number of biologically and disease-relevant condensate systems, experimental techniques that enable high-throughput analysis of protein phase behaviour are required. To address this challenge, we present here a combinatorial droplet microfluidic platform, termed PhaseScan, for the rapid and high-resolution acquisition of protein phase diagrams in multiple chemical and physical dimensions. Using this platform, we characterise the phase behaviour of a wide range of protein systems under a variety of conditions and show that this platform can be used to characterise quantitatively the effect of small molecules on biomolecular phase transitions.","output":"High Resolution and Multidimensional Protein Condensate Phase Diagrams with a Combinatorial Microdroplet Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) has caused multiple consequences globally, and all can be researched and addressed multidisciplinary, ie from a health (medical), legal, economic and security aspect.

We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation.

This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example. Methodology/Principal Findings Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables. For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state, Conclusions/Significance The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission.

How this high risk in COVID-19 patients compares to those observed in hospitalized patients with other viral pneumonias such as influenza is unknown. Objectives: To assess the incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients as opposed to that observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study; we used data from Statistics Netherlands (study period: 2018) on thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients. In parallel, we assessed the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications - adjusted for competing risk of death - in patients with COVID-19 in three Dutch hospitals (February 24th - April 26th 2020). Results: Of the 13.217 hospitalized influenza patients, 437 (3.3%) were diagnosed with thrombotic complications, versus 66 (11%) of the 579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The 30-day cumulative incidence of any thrombotic complication in influenza was 11% (95%CI 9.4-12) versus 25% (95%CI 18-32) in COVID-19. For venous thrombotic complications (VTE) and arterial thrombotic complications alone, these numbers were respectively 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.6) and 7.5% (95%CI 6.3-8.8) in influenza versus 23% (95%CI 16-29) and 4.4% (95%CI 1.9-8.8) in COVID-19. Conclusions: The incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients was lower than in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

First, we employ qualitative methods of deep observation for understanding problematic online speech. This initial qualitative study constructs an ontology of problematic speech, which contains social media postings annotated with their underlying opinions. The qualitative study dynamically constructs the set of opinions, simultaneous with labeling the postings. Next, we use keywords to collect a large dataset from three online social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube). Finally, we introduce an iterative data exploration procedure to augment the dataset. It alternates between a data sampler -- which balances exploration and exploitation of unlabeled data -- the automatic labeling of the sampled data, the manual inspection by the qualitative mapping team, and, finally, the retraining of the automatic opinion classifiers.

SUMMARY: The department of pharmacys COVID-19 pandemic response included successful planning and implementation of measures to maintain pharmacy operations and minimize COVID-19 exposure of patients and staff. These measures included ensuring adequate personnel staffing using flexible staffing solutions, ongoing assessment of supply chain integrity, and continuation of integrated clinical pharmacy services 24/7 throughout the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information technology (IT) and educational program modifications are also discussed. CONCLUSION: This report describes successful crisis planning and risk mitigation in the setting of COVID-19, which was facilitated by the department of pharmacys integrated clinical practice model. This model enabled uninterrupted personnel scheduling, supply chain integrity, continued provision of 24/7 integrated clinical services, adaptive use of IT tools, and continuation of educational programs. The experiences described may be instructive to other pharmacy departments in evaluating their response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in planning for similar pandemic or other emergency scenarios.","output":"Emergency preparation and mitigation for COVID-19 response in an integrated pharmacy practice model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferons are an essential component of the innate arm of the immune system and are arguably one of the most important lines of defence against viruses. The human IFN system and its functionality has already been largely characterized and studied in detail. However, the IFN systems of bats have only been marginally examined to date up until the recent developments of the Bat1k project which have now opened new opportunities in research by identifying six new bat genomes to possess novel genes that are likely associated with viral tolerance exhibited in bats. Interestingly, bats have been hypothesized to possess the ability to establish a host-virus relationship where despite being infected, they exhibit limited signs of disease and still retain the ability to transmit the disease into other susceptible hosts. Bats are one of the most abundant and widespread vertebrates on the planet and host many zoonotic viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans. Several genomics, immunological, and biological features are thought to underlie novel antiviral mechanisms of bats. This review aims to explore the bat IFN system and developments in its diverse IFN features, focusing mainly on the model species, the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), while also highlighting bat innate immunity as an exciting and fruitful area of research to understand their ability to control viral-mediated pathogenesis.","output":"Fundamental Characteristics of Bat Interferon Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus capable of causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared as a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, by the World Health Organization.

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with cyclodialysis cleft and lens subluxation after blunt trauma were recruited in this study. They were categorized into the low IOP group (IOP < 10 mmHg) and normal IOP group (between 10 mm and 21 mmHg). A modified CTR (MCTR) or CTR was sutured into the ciliary sulcus, and another MCTR or CTR was implanted in the capsular bag. The prognosis outcome measurements, including BCVA (LogMAR), IOP, UBM, and macular character on OCT, were collected during the regular outpatient follow-up after surgery until the recovery of cyclodialysis cleft was found. Measures of cyclodialysis cleft recovery included successful IOP control (defined as an IOP within 10C21 mmHg), confirmation of cleft closure on UBM, and confirmation of IOL centration under slit-lamp examination. Follow-up period or recovery time was regarded as the duration between discharge from the hospital after the operation and the recovery of cyclodialysis cleft. The longest follow-up period was 1 year. RESULTS: Cyclodialysis cleft was successfully treated in 21/25 eyes, whereas lens subluxation was treated effectively in all 25 eyes. CTRs and IOLs were stable in all eyes. BCVA (P < 0.001) and IOP (P < 0.001) were significantly improved after surgery. The primary surgical complication included reversible IOP spike in seven eyes. Postoperative BCVA was found to have correlation with the preoperative IOP (P = 0.016), maculopathy (P = 0.002,), and trauma duration (P = 0.046). Worse BCVA (P = 0.037) and more severe grade of maculopathy (P = 0.030) were observed in the low IOP group (14 eyes). In contrast, a better prognosis and greater probability of IOP spike (P = 0.021) were observed in the normal IOP group (11 eyes). CONCLUSION: Timely and proper intervention for traumatic cyclodialysis cleft associated with lens subluxation is essential. Lower preoperative IOP is associated with worse prognosis and prolonged recovery time, while caution should be taken in IOP spike monitoring in patients with normal preoperative IOP.

A key and enduring focus has been the support of behavioral interventions, particularly for tobacco, diet, physical activity, and sun exposure. The success of such interventions will be amplified to the extent that they leverage novel research designs, emerging digital technologies, evidence gleaned from the burgeoning field of implementation science, and lessons learned from greater attention to the impact of health disparities and inequities. Moreover, as the cancer survivor population continues to grow given the rapid development of diagnostic and therapeutic science, it will be even more essential to devote attention to understanding and addressing the health care and other needs of survivors such as cognitive dysfunction and financial toxicity.

All but one patient were approached through a contralateral percutaneous transfemoral access, and the SG was always deployed from the common femoral artery to the profunda femoris artery. For this study, primary outcomes of interest were early ( 30 days) survival and patency rate. RESULTS: We identified 10/823 cases of the entire PSA cohort (1.2%). There were 9 men and 1 woman: the mean age was 76 years  9 (range: 64-92). Urgent intervention was performed in 4 patients. The median operative time was 30 min (IQR: 25-36).

In addition, they can become environmental reservoirs, through the ingestion of food or contaminated water, and vectors for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This fact is even more important in migratory birds that can promote their dissemination across continents. In this work, a multiresidue analytical method suitable for the determination of five families of antibiotics and their main metabolites in waterbird faeces has been developed and validated. The target compounds include environmentally significant sulfonamides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and antifolates. Sample treatment involves ultrasound-assisted extraction with methanol and dispersive solid-phase extraction clean-up with C18. Analytical determination was carried out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The most significant parameters affecting sample extraction and extract clean-up were optimised by means of experimental designs. Good linearity (R2 > 0.994), accuracy (from 41 to 127%), precision (relative standard deviation lower than 24%) and limits of quantification (lower than 2 ng g-1 (dry weight, dw)) were obtained for most of the compounds. The method was applied to the determination of the selected compounds in 27 faeces samples from three common migratory waterbird species.

We aimed to describe the characteristics and predictors for developing in-hospital neurologic manifestations in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico City. METHODS: We analyzed records from consecutive adult patients hospitalized from March 15 to June 30, 2020, with moderate to severe COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neurologic syndromes were actively searched by a standardized structured questionnaire and physical examination, confirmed by neuroimaging, neurophysiology of laboratory analyses, as applicable. RESULTS: We studied 1,072 cases (65% men, mean age 53.213 years), 71 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases (diabetic neuropathy: 17, epilepsy: 15, history of ischemic stroke: eight, migraine: six, multiple sclerosis: one, Parkinson disease: one), and 163 (15.2%) developed a new neurologic complication. Headache (41.7%), myalgia (38.5%), dysgeusia (8%), and anosmia (7%) were the most common neurologic symptoms at hospital presentation. Delirium (13.1%), objective limb weakness (5.1%), and delayed recovery of mental status after sedation withdrawal (2.5%), were the most common new neurologic syndromes. Age, headache at presentation, preexisting neurologic disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio &#8805;9 were independent predictors of new in-hospital neurologic complications.

This paper presents a novel progressive deep learning framework, herein referred to as 3D POCO Net, that offers high accuracy in estimating orientations about three rotational axes yet with efficiency in network complexity. The proposed 3D POCO Net is configured, using four PointNet-based networks for independently representing the object class and three individual axes of rotations. The four independent networks are linked by in-between association subnetworks that are trained to progressively map the global features learned by individual networks one after another for fine-tuning the independent networks. In 3D POCO Net, high accuracy is achieved by combining a high precision classification based on a large number of orientation classes with a regression based on a weighted sum of classification outputs, while high efficiency is maintained by a progressive framework by which a large number of orientation classes are grouped into independent networks linked by association subnetworks. We implemented 3D POCO Net for full three-axis orientation variations and trained it with about 146 million orientation variations augmented from the ModelNet10 dataset. The testing results show that we can achieve an orientation regression error of about 2.5 with about 90% accuracy in object classification for general three-axis orientation estimation and object classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a pre-trained 3D POCO Net can serve as an orientation representation platform based on which orientations as well as object classes of partial point clouds from occluded objects are learned in the form of transfer learning.","output":"Progressive Deep Learning Framework for Recognizing 3D Orientations and Object Class Based on Point Cloud Representation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries.

A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT\\\\PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n = 5) or 3 (n = 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n = 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n = 13), rhinoviruses (n = 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n = 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n = 2), and bocavirus (n = 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal.

This led to the rapid implementation of reactive measures to provide business continuity. The operations and supply chain management literature has grouped these reactive techniques into those that involve the reconfiguration of firm resources and those that involve changes to its decision-making processes. Unfortunately, little of this work has empirically assessed the efficacy of individual reactive techniques on business continuity after the onset of a disruption such as COVID-19. The research reported in this paper addresses this gap through an experimental design and discrete event simulation to empirically test the impact on firm outcomes of resource reconfiguration techniques versus those related to adaptive decision-making processes.

We collected data on all the trauma admissions to a single University hospital DEA (Department of Emergency and Acceptance) in Rome during the COVID- 19 pandemic lockdown in Italy, comparing them with the corresponding period in 2019. We reported demographic data; the characteristics of the injury, including the anatomical location, fracture, sprain, dislocation, contusion, laceration, whether the injury site was exposed or closed, where the injury occurred, and polytrauma. We also recorded the waiting time in the emergency room and mode of transportation. The study sample was composed of 1199 patients, 636 (53.04%) males and 563 (46.96%) females. The overall number of admissions in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) was 995; then it was 204 during COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. The average age of the 2020 group was 51.9  24.8 years, significantly higher than that of the 2019 group (41.4  25.7) (p<0.0001). In particular, elderly patients (65 years) were the most commonly involved in the COVID-19 group, while in the pre- COVID-19 period they were middle-aged adults (15-44 years) (p<0.0001). The injury occurred at home in 65.7% of cases in the 2020 group, and in 32.3% of patients in the 2019 group.

One result of the COVID-19 pandemic is the emergence of an urgent requirement for effective techniques and technologies for screening individuals showing symptoms of infection in a non-invasive and non-contact way. Systems that exploit thermal imaging technology to screen individuals show promise to satisfy the desired criteria, including offering a non-contact, non-invasive method of temperature measurement. Furthermore, the potential for mass and passive screening makes thermal imaging systems an attractive technology where current 'standard of care' methods are not practical. Critically, any fever screening solution must be capable of accurate temperature measurement and subsequent prediction of core temperature. This is essential to ensure a high sensitivity in identifying fever while maintaining a low rate of false positives. This paper discusses the results and analysis of a clinical trial undertaken by Thales UK Ltd and the Queen Elizabeth University Teaching Hospital in Glasgow to assess the accuracy and operation of the High Temperature Detection (HTD) system developed by Thales UK Ltd when used in a clinical setting. Results of this single centre prospective observational cohort study show that the measured laboratory accuracy of the Thales HTD system (RMSE=0.1{degrees}C) is comparable to the accuracy when used in a clinical setting (RMSE=0.15{degrees}C) when measuring a calibrated blackbody source at typical skin temperature. For measurement of forehead skin temperature, the system produced results commensurate with close contact measurement methods (R=0.86, Mean error = 0.05{degrees}C). Compared to measured tympanic temperatures, measurement of the forehead skin temperature by the HTD system showed a moderate correlation (R=0.43), which is stronger than close contact IR forehead thermometers (R=0.20, 0.35). An improved correlation was observed between the maximum facial temperature measured by the HTD system and measured tympanic temperatures (R=0.53), which is significantly stronger than the close contact methods. A linear predictive model for tympanic temperature based on the measured maximum facial temperatures resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE=0.50{degrees}C) that is marginally larger than what is expected as a compound of errors in the measuring devices (RMSE=0.45{degrees}C). The study demonstrates that the HTD could be applied in the clinical and non-clinical setting as a screening mechanism to detect citizens with raised temperature. This approach would enable high volume surveillance and identification of individuals that contribute to further spread of COVID-19. Deployment of the HTD system could be implemented as part of a screening tool to support measures to enhance public safety and confidence in areas of high throughput, such as airports, shopping centres or places of work.","output":"Thermal Camera detection of High Temperature for mass COVID Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the fear of infection increases and, with it, the stigma-discrimination, which makes it an additional problem of the epidemic.

Herein, targeting multifunctional hydrophilic nanomicelles, AgBiS2@DSPE-PEG2000-FA (ABS-FA), were obtained and employed for tumor treatment. In a cascade amplification mode, ABS-FA exhibited favorable properties of actively enhancing Computed Tomography/Infrared (CT/IR) imaging and gently relieving ambient oxygen concentration by cooperative photothermal and sonodynamic therapy. Compared with traditional Bi2S3 nanoparticles, the CT imaging capability of the probe was augmented (43.21%), and the photothermal conversion efficiency was increased (33.1%). Furthermore, remarkable ultrasonic dynamics features of ABS-FA were observed, with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (24.3%) being obtained compared to Ce6, a commonly used sonosensitizer. Furthermore, ABS-FA exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on HeLa cell migration at 6 g/mL, which to some extent demonstrated its suppressive effect on tumor growth. A lower dose, laser and ultrasonic power, and a shorter processing time endowed ABS-FA with excellent photothermal and sonodynamic effects. By mild cascade mode, the hypoxic condition of the tumor site was largely improved, and a suitable oxygen-rich environment was provided, thereby endowing ABS-FA with a superior synergistic enhanced treatment effect compared with the single mode approach, which ultimately realized the purpose of \\"one injection, multiple treatment\\". Moreover, our data showed that ABS-FA was given with a biological safety profile while harnessed in vivo.

However, no comprehensive evaluation of the safety of these possible agents is available, and is urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the risks of cardiac adverse events associated with the possible pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, including certain antimalarial, antiviral, and antibiotic drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conduced retrospective pharmacovigilance analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR), a data mining algorithm commonly used in pharmacovigilance assessment, was generated to quantify the detection signal of adverse events. RESULTS: Among individuals without coronavirus infection from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q1, increased risks for cardiac disorders were found for antiviral agents such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (ROR: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-1.70), lopinavir/ritonavir (ROR: 1.52; 95% CI 1.39-1.66), and antibiotics such as azithromycin (ROR: 1.37; 95% CI 1.30-1.44) and ceftriaxone (ROR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.80-2.05). Increased serious cardiac adverse events, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac arrest, were also reported for these drugs. Further analyses of individuals with coronavirus infections revealed that 40% of individuals receiving chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine reported serious cardiac adverse events. Two cases resulted in QT prolongations and one case resulted in cardiac arrest. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin contributed to all the QT prolongation and cardiac arrest cases. CONCLUSIONS: The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 are associated with increased risks of cardiac adverse events. Variations in the cardiac safety profiles of these pharmacotherapies were also observed. Clinicians should closely monitor patients with COVID-19, especially those at high risk, using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.","output":"Pharmacotherapy Management for COVID-19 and Cardiac Safety: A Data Mining Approach for Pharmacovigilance Evidence from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All of the authors who have contributed to this issue on COVID19 and the Media have stepped out of the rush of change, if only for a 2000-word moment, to look into a corner of the mediated pandemic and grapple with the significance of whats happening in our field, our societies, our lives.

This scenario makes it difficult the caring to prevent COVID-19 contamination. Belo Horizonte, like other Brazilian capital cities, presents this scenario, which calls society's attention. OBJECTIVE: Experience report made by Nursing academics who took basic food baskets to a slum during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Social action by three Nursing students who collected and delivered basic food baskets to a community in Belo Horizonte. It became an opportunity to social assistance and to the understanding of how these slum dwellers face COVID-19. A local leader prepared a list of families facing vulnerable situation. These families received the baskets. At the time of the deliveries, there was an opportunity to answer some doubts about COVID-19 and health. RESULTS: The dwellers moved around on the streets without masks, maybe because of lack of resources. The dwellings did not favor social distancing and hygiene care. There were small rooms, excess of people, little ventilation, and deficient sanitation conditions. The people who were infected with the virus suffered retaliation because the other people were afraid of COVID-19 transmission. The infected people became cloistered at home to avoid the community retaliation. Everyone thanked the delivery of basic food baskets saying that this delivery would be a relief during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: By observation and contact with the dwellers, it was possible to notice the scarcity of resources and the need of financial and informational help about COVID-19 and other health topics. The basic food basket donation was relevant to the families, but the number of donations did not supply the local necessity. Other social and governmental actions are needed to promote local health. KEY MESSAGES: Financial aid from the government must be implemented so that people on the street can have the basics to survive.

Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies. The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention. The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1 secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities. We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability. Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes.","output":"IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy mitigates placental dysfunction and perinatal injury following Zika virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim To evaluate an epidemiological characteristic and the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women from the Far East and Siberian Federal Districts of Russia Materials and methods The analysis of operational information on the incidence of COVID-19 and the its features in pregnant women and alter childbirth prov ided by the chief obstctrician-gynecologists of the Far F astcrn Federal District and Siberian Federal District on Ma)-25, 2020 and August 25,2020 is carried out Mathematical analysis included descriptive statistics methods, analy sis of contingency tables, where the x2 value, the achieved significance level (p) Results On August 25, 2020, 2010 cases of COVID-19 in pregnant women were detected in two subjects, including 134 active cases In the population, the proportion of pregnant women among cases of COVID-19 was 1 45% Pneumonia in pregnant women was registered in 44 8% of cases, severe course of the disease-in 37%, hospitalization in RAW-in 1 9% of cases, mechanical ventilation-0 In the population, pneumonia was registered in 24 4% of cases, hospitalized in RAW-2 1%, on mechanical ventilation-0 77% The incidence in pregnant women was 1464 7 per 100 000 (in the population-591-8 per 100 000) 23 (1 76%) COV1D-19 (+) newborns were identified, despite preventive measures and separation of mother and child immediately after childbirth, which docs not exclude vertical transmission of the disease Maternal mortality was 2 (0 1%) cases vs population mortality 1 49% Perinatal mortality was 7 (0 35%) cases There were 5 (0 25;) stillbirths Farly neonatal mortality was 2 (0 1%) cases Conclusions The incidence of COVID-19 in pregnant women in the Far East and Siberia is higher than in the general population with a higher incidence of pneumonia, but a milder course: Less need lor 1CU, mechanical ventilation and mortality 23 cases of SARS-CoV-2-positivc newborns, despite the separation of mother and child, do not exclude the possibility of vertical transmission of infection ? 2021 Universidade de Sao Paulo All rights reserved","output":"Dynamics of the epidemic process and the course of the COVID-19 in pregnant women of the Far Eastern and Siberian Federal Districts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: College campuses closed in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupting the lives of students. The goal of the present study was to examine whether cannabis use changed from before campus departures prompted by COVID-19 to after campus departures and after the semester ended--and if living situation explained observed changes. We also examined changes in specific formulations of cannabis and self-reported reasons for perceived changes in use frequency. METHOD: A sample of 223 college student cannabis users (61% female) from three universities completed two online surveys (one in May 2020 assessing cannabis use pre-campus closure [pre-closure] and since campus closed [post-closure-1], and another in September 2020 assessing cannabis use since remote classes ended [post-closure-2]). RESULTS: Any use of cannabis and use of each specific formulation (leaf, edibles, concentrates) declined from pre-closure to post-closure-1, whereas the frequency of use did not change. Any cannabis use declined for those who stayed living dependently or moved to dependent living. Leaf use declined for all groups, concentrate use declined only for those who moved from independent to dependent living, and edible use declined only for those who stayed living dependently or moved to dependent living. Cannabis use did not change between post-closure-1 and post-closure-2, regardless of living situation stability or transition.

Patients were categorised by Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were tocilizumab treatment, length of hospital stay, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, kidney function and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of the 290 included patients, 54 were frail according to the CFS (&#8805;5 points; prevalence 18.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-23.7) vs 65 by HFRS (&#8805;5 points; prevalence: 22.4%, 95% CI 17.8-27.7).

We investigated the potential diagnostic efficacy of olfactory-stimulated fNIRS for early detection of MCI and/or Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We conducted a patient-level, single-group, diagnostic interventional trial involving elderly volunteers (age >60 years) suspected of declining cognitive function. Patients received open-label olfactory-stimulated fNIRS for measurement of oxygenation difference in the orbitofrontal cortex. All participants underwent amyloid PET, MRI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB). RESULTS: Of 97 subjects, 28 (28.9%) were cognitively normal, 32 (33.0%) had preclinical AD, 21 (21.6%) had MCI, and 16 (16.5%) had AD. Olfactory-stimulated oxygenation differences in the orbitofrontal cortex were associated with cognitive impairment; the association was more pronounced with cognitive severity.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations in the USA. No literature exists comparing state-level CSC. It is unknown how equitably CSC would allocate resources. METHODS: The authors identified all publicly available state-level CSC through online searches and communication with state governments. Publicly available CSC were systematically reviewed for content including ethical framework and prioritization strategy. RESULTS: CSC were identified for 29 states. Ethical principles were explicitly stated in 23 (79.3%). Equity was listed as a guiding ethical principle in 15 (51.7%); 19 (65.5%) said decisions should not factor in race, ethnicity, disability, and other identity-based factors. Ten states (34.4%) allowed for consideration of societal value, which could lead to prioritization of health care workers and other essential personnel. Twenty-one (72.4%) CSC provided a specific strategy for prioritizing patients for critical care resources, e.g., ventilators. All incorporated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores; 15 (71.4%) of these specific CSC considered comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiac disease, renal failure, malignancy) in resource allocation decisions.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using an approach from human-centered design for this qualitative study, virtual qualitative interviews were conducted among 40 professionals from nonmedical fields to investigate antiracism practices used outside of medicine. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify latent themes and practices that may be adaptable to health care, subsequently using an established theoretical framework describing levels of racism to interpret and organize themes. Convenience and purposive sampling was used to recruit participants via email, social media, and electronic flyers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antiracism practices adapted to medicine. RESULTS: Among 40 professionals from nonmedical fields, most were younger than age 40 years (23 individuals [57.5%]) and there were 20 (50.0%) women; there were 25 Black or African American individuals (62.5%); 4 East Asian, Southeast Asian, or South Asian individuals (10.0%); 3 individuals with Hispanic, Latinx, or Spanish origin (7.5%); and 3 White individuals. Participants described personally mediated, institutional, and internalized antiracism practices that may be adaptable to promote health equity for Black patients. Personally mediated antiracism practices included dialogue and humble inquiry, building trust, and allyship and shared humanity; clinicians may be able to adopt these practices by focusing on patient successes, avoiding stigmatizing language in the electronic health record, and using specific phrases to address racism in the moment. Institutional antiracism practices included education, representation, and mentorship; in the health care setting, clinics may be able to develop staff affiliate groups, focus on improving racial health equity outcomes, and conduct antiracism trainings. Internalized antiracism practices centered on authenticity; clinicians may be able to write positionality statements reflecting their identity and the expertise they bring to clinical encounters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This studys findings suggest that antiracism practices from outside the health care sector may offer innovative strategies to promote health equity by addressing personally mediated, institutional, and internalized racism in clinical care.","output":"Nonmedical Transdisciplinary Perspectives of Black and Racially and Ethnically Diverse Individuals About Antiracism Practices: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to review and often suspend services, while patients continue to suffer with painful musculoskeletal conditions. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of intraarticular corticosteroid injections (IACSI) cannot be denied. Current BOA guidelines advise giving the lowest effective dose for inflammatory arthritis and limit use in osteoarthritis to patients with high levels of pain and disability. We aimed to evaluate the literature pertaining to the use of IACSI and the potential systemic immunosuppressive effects. Method: We searched Medline, using the terms 'systemic effects of intra- articular steroid' and 'clinical course of Coronavirus infection in patients with steroid use', between 1997 and 2020. Results: No studies specifically looked at the systemic effects of intraarticular steroids in the presence of COVID-19 infection;however, four studies were identified which concluded that intra-articular steroid injections resulted in sufficient systemic absorption to cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and endogenous cortisol production. These effects are dose dependent and are more common in patients with inflammatory joint diseases. A further four RCT's, including one systematic review, showed that suppressed cortisol concentration was associated with a significant increase in mortality. Conclusions: There is a lack of evidence in relation to the use of intraarticular steroids in COVID-19. However, evidence suggests that intraarticular steroids can result in systemic absorption and suppression of endogenous cortisol production thus increasing the potential risk of complications of COVID-19. We therefore support cautious use of low dose steroid injections in patients with inflammatory arthritis, where no alternative treatment is available.","output":"The systemic effects of intra-articular steroid injections- should CIVID-19 change our practice?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the use of text messages to communicate information to patients whose surgeries were postponed because of the COVID-19 restriction on elective surgeries.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS: The main findings of this study are that 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001), 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (?=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","output":"Low diaphragm muscle mass predicts adverse outcome in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia: an exploratory pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"December 2013, an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus began in a small village in southern Guinea, the first outbreak of the Zaire Ebola strain in West Africa.

The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A micro-well dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of the essential oil and its major constituents. A model of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in mice was used to determine its in vivo activities. Lung and blood samples were obtained to assess bacterial cell counts. Toxicity evaluation of the essential oil and its components was completed by performing biochemical analysis of the serum, particularly monitoring aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea and creatinine. The essential oil exhibited potent antibacterial activity, whereas the two major constituents were less potent. The essential oil exhibited MIC values between 20 and 80 g/ml, while the values of the two constituents were between 130 and 200 g/ml. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrated that the essential oil inhibited biofilm formation and altered its architecture. Survival curves indicated that the essential oil led to a reduction in the viability of different bacteria. The essential oil also induced significant leakage of potassium ions from S. pyogenes. The essential oil (100 g/mouse) and grandisol (135 g/mouse) significantly reduced the number of viable bacterial cells in the lungs (P<0.01). However, intake of 100 g/mouse of essential oil or grandisol 135 g/mouse once or twice each day for 9 days did not produce any toxic effects in the mice. In conclusion, the in vitro and in vivo results suggested that the essential oil of A. vestita and one of its major constituents, grandisol, can significantly inhibit the growth of different bacterial strains.","output":"Essential oil of Artemisia vestita exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity: Investigation of the effect of oil on biofilm formation, leakage of potassium ions and survival curve measurement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 incidence and mortality in countries with heavy social inequalities differ in population terms.

Methods This retrospective study enrolled 31 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020. Lung ultrasounds were performed in all cases to evaluate the ultrasound manifestations of the patient's lung lesions and to determine the lung ultrasound scores (LUS). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for the multifactor analysis of 7 candidate parameters, including the LUS and the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the LUS. Results Lung ultrasound images of COVID-19 patients mainly reflected the presence of interstitial pulmonary lesions (90.3%, 28/31). The lung lesions were primarily distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. Multivariate analyses identified the oxygenation index, the LUS, and the lymphocyte count as factors related to the progression to severe-critical disease in COVID-19 patients (P<0.05). With a cut-off value of 9.5, the area under the ROC curve was 0.910. The LUS showed a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 93.0%, respectively (P0.001), with an overall accuracy of 75%. Conclusions The lung ultrasound findings in COVID-19 patients were mainly and specifically manifested as interstitial lesions involving the peripheral zones of the lung.

Pathogenesis of the vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 is least understood for now and presents a challenge to the treating physicians. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for COVID-19, has been shown to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in human epithelial cells which facilitates its entry in the organ and mediate tissue specific pathogenesis. For ACE2 mediated cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2, co-expression of one more protein-Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential. Existing studies suggested significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human vascular endothelium. Vascular endothelial dysfunction can potentially activate coagulation cascade eventually resulting in thrombosis. ACE2 has proven role in the maintenance of endothelial integrity inside the vessels. Existing in situ evidence for SARS-CoV-1 (the causative agent for SARS pandemic of 2002, which shared ACE2 as cell entry receptor) suggested that virus binding can downregulate ACE2, thus can induce endothelial dysfunction. Recently, in situ evidence has been presented that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in engineered human vascular endothelium, which can be effectively blocked by using clinical-grade recombinant human ACE2.

The health sector continues to grow effectively, developing new ideas for saving lives and making complex processes more accessible, such as stem cell transplantation therapy. The treatment of individual neurological disorders is associated with different pathophysiological conditions, so transplantation therapy must be performed under optimal conditions with minimal risk. The promise of stem cell transplantation increases every day, with excellent animal models and small-scale observations in human trials. Stem cell therapy provides satisfactory data that support rational therapeutic purposes. ABSTRACT: Neurodegenerative diseases are a global health issue with inadequate therapeutic options and an inability to restore the damaged nervous system. With advances in technology, health scientists continue to identify new approaches to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Lost or injured neurons and glial cells can lead to the development of several neurological diseases, including Parkinsons disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells in the laboratory utilizing cell culture technologies, fueling efforts to develop stem cell-based transplantation therapies for human patients. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or differentiate into a germ cell with specialized characteristics, such as muscle cells, red blood cells, or brain cells. Although several obstacles remain before stem cells can be used for clinical applications, including some potential disadvantages that must be overcome, this cellular development represents a potential pathway through which patients may eventually achieve the ability to live more normal lives. In this review, we summarize the stem cell-based therapies that have been explored for various neurological disorders, discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of these therapies, and examine future directions for this field.","output":"Stem Cell Transplantation Therapy and Neurological Disorders: Current Status and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with negative long-term outcomes.

As variants of concern arise during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific N-terminal domain site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility.

RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%).

Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The effects of state earned income tax credits on mental health and health behaviors: A quasi-experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 remains ill-defined.

Among the reasons cited by HCWs is a lack of time to attend the vaccination clinic. For the 2018/2019 influenza season, active (on-site) influenza vaccination was offered directly in 44 operative units (OUs) of the Bari Policlinico hospital (50 OUs, 3,397 HCWs). At the same time, the hospital granted the HCW access to the vaccination clinic during October and December 2018. VC achieved among HCWs of Bari Policlinico during the 2018/2019 influenza season was then analyzed, and the results compared with those of the 2017/18 season. During the 2018/19 season, VC was 20.4% (n = 798) and thus higher than the 14.2% of the 2017/18 season (+6.2%). The highest VC was among physicians (33.4%), followed by other HCWs (23.8%), auxiliary staff (8.6%), and nurses (7.2%). Overall, 284 (36.5%) HCWs were vaccinated at on-site sessions. Multivariate analysis showed that vaccination uptake was associated with male gender and with work in OU where vaccination was actively offered. On the other hand, being a nurse or auxiliary staff member and working in the surgical area were deterrents. Although VC remained unsatisfactory, active on-site vaccination proved to be an important strategy to improve vaccination compliance, increasing 44% compared to the previous season. Nonetheless, mandatory vaccination directed by public health institutions may be the only way to reach a minimum level of coverage.","output":"Two years of on-site influenza vaccination strategy in an Italian university hospital: main results and lessons learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection is the first step in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Our results show that considering the support variable as endogenous significantly increased its impact on farmers land. A farmers past land allocation decisions also affected their current lands holdings. However, the results varied considerably between regions and between different land sizes. Therefore, the findings show the importance of heterogeneity in the impact of support policies. We conclude that due to the heterogeneous impact of support policies, it might not be possible to discuss the effect of support policies using an average estimate applicable for all farmers.

For neuroinflammation, isoorientin treatment reduced the number of activated microglia associated with A-positive plaques, and in parallel reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Strikingly, isoorientin reversed deficits in synaptic long-term potentiation and spatial memory relevant to cognitive functions.

Subjects and methods. A multicenter prospective observational study included 90 COVID-19 patients treated in ICU whose transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) values were below 93% despite treatment. Depending on the degree of impaired oxygenation, patients underwent oxygen therapy through a mask or nasal cannula, high-flow oxygenation or non-invasive ventilation, while it was not always possible to achieve the target values of oxygenation parameters. The patients were divided into the following groups: Group 1 - SpO2 above 93%, Group 2 - SpO2 within 93-90%, Group 3 - SpO2 within 85-89%, Group 4- SpO2 within 80-84%, Group 5 - SpO2 within 75-79%, and Group 6 - below 75%. Results. It was revealed that during ARF management by noninvasive methods, different values of transcutaneous saturation and corresponding changes in the acid-base balance (ABB) and blood gas composition were determined When transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) decreased to 85%, there was a corresponding moderate decrease in PaO2 while no metabolic changes occurred. As a rule, there were no obvious clinical signs of respiratory failure (silent hypoxia). In patients with SpO2 reduction down 80-85%, clinical signs of respiratory failure (dyspnea, tachypnea, agitation) and, as a rule, a moderate increase in PCO2 with the development of respiratory acidosis and compensatory metabolic alkalosis were noted. When SpO2 decreased down to 75-79%, arterial hypoxemia was usually accompanied by moderate hypercapnia and the development of decompensated mixed acidosis and venous desaturation as well as increased lactate levels. With transcutaneous saturation going below 74%, these changes were even more pronounced and were observed in all patients of this group. Conclusion. The revealed changes are mostly consistent with generally accepted ideas about the relationship between values of transcutaneous saturation and blood gas composition and parameters of blood ABB in the case of ARF. Reduction of transcutaneous saturation down to 85% not accompanied by pronounced clinical signs of respiratory failure (dyspnea, tachypnea, agitation), development of acidosis and venous desaturation, and the elevated lactate level can be regarded as relatively safe. ? 2021 Serbian Chemical Society.

The emerging vision for transformation proposed by interviewees focuses on the need for increased decision-making power for community actors, yet legacies of entrenched government power and organizational silos between fire and forestry continue to constrain transformation.

Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control.

The emergence of biotechnology profoundly impacted the health of the world, and the economic vitality of regions where bio clusters and bioresearch parks grew. This article explores some of the historical and policy implications undergirding this development in the United States and the importance of alignment of life science research activity, public policies, and leadership to build place-based communities of biotechnology innovation. Discussion: The real scientific advances in biotechnology research are beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, this paper will review the growth of team science, the historical factors supporting the growth of the technology sectors with an emphasis on biotech clusters and bioresearch parks, and policies and programs in the 20th Century that helped launch the 21st Bio Century. We conclude with a ranking of the leading biotech clusters in the US, the factors supporting bio clusters, with a case study of the emergence of the multi-jurisdictional BioHealth Capital Region in Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia. Conclusion: Regions that coordinate life science research at anchor institutions, take advantage of supportive federal policies, spur local bio innovation incentives, and foster private leadership will be those that advance faster and farther in bio health economic development. Beyond the advantages of local economic development, an agile and responsive biohealth cluster can spur global health solutions. The unprecedented speed and international cooperation, as the responses to the need for Covid19 vaccine development, and distribution have demonstrated to the world, can be applied more broadly for other health needs and broadter technology solutions.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The participants were recruited by the snowball sampling method, and the data were collected by means of a link sent to their smartphones through their social media accounts. This study included 211 households with at least 1 child. RESULTS: The study revealed that 21.8% households had food insecurity that was not at the hunger threshold. The monthly income of 80.6% of the households was below the poverty line and monthly income decreased in more than half of the households during the pandemic. Food insecurity increased 2.5 times when the households comprised workers or self-employed individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 2.529; P = 0.002), increased 3 times when the monthly income of the households decreased (OR = 3.131; P = 0.000), and increased 2 times when total monthly income of the household fell below poverty line during the pandemic (OR = 2.001; P = 0.049).

Understanding both direct and indirect damage caused to the heart and the vascular system by SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to identify optimal clinical care strategies. The homeostasis of the cardiovascular system requires a tight regulation of the gene expression, which is controlled by multiple types of RNA molecules, including RNA encoding proteins (messenger RNAs) (mRNAs) and those lacking protein-coding potential, the noncoding-RNAs. In the last few years, dysregulation of noncoding-RNAs has emerged as a crucial component in the pathophysiology of virtually all cardiovascular diseases.

METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I trial with an unblinded dose escalation and a double-blind treatment phase at 2 sites in France and Belgium to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of V591. Ninety healthy SARS-CoV-2 sero-negative adults (18-55 years of age) were randomized into 3 cohorts, each comprising 24 vaccinees and 6 placebo recipients. Participants received two intramuscular injections of a low dose vaccine (1  10(5) median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose [TCID(50)]), one or two injections of a high dose vaccine (1  10(6) TCID(50)), or placebo with a 28 day interval. Safety was assessed by solicited and unsolicited adverse events. Immunogenicity was measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, spike-specific T cell responses, and anti-measles antibodies. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04497298. FINDINGS: Between Aug 10 and Oct 13, 2020, 148 volunteers were screened of whom 90 were randomized. V591 showed a good safety profile at both dose levels. No serious adverse events were reported. At least one treatment-related adverse event was reported by 15 (20.8%) participants receiving V591 vs. 6 (33.3%) of participants receiving placebo. Eighty-one percent of participants receiving two injections of V591 developed spike-binding antibodies after the second injection. However, neutralizing antibodies were detectable on day 56 only in 17% of participants receiving the low dose and 61% receiving the high dose (2 injections). Spike-specific T cell responses were not detected. Pre-existing anti-measles immunity had a statistically significant impact on the immune response to V591, which was in contrast to previous results with the measles vector-based chikungunya vaccine.

Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of incident pediatric strokes with SARS-CoV-2 in the first 3 months of the pandemic in an international cohort. METHODS: We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (&#8804; 18 years) patients with SARS-CoV-2; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for pediatric patients with stroke; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Of 42 centers with SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization numbers, 8 of 971 (0.82%) pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 from March to May 2020 were: 1 of 108 with neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0 of 33 with neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6 of 166 with childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1 of 54 with childhood CSVT (1.9%). However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9, 0, 6.1, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS-CoV-2. Seven of 8 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and stroke had additional established stroke risk factors.

Telehealth may simplify care logistics (e.g. reduce travel and waiting times), but it may also unintentionally exacerbate existing disparities in healthcare utilization by race/ethnicity, age, or rural/urban status. As telehealth will likely continue long-term, we examined telehealth use at a comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic across patient populations with established disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed telehealth visits from March until December 2020 among individuals diagnosed with cancer at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center (MCC). We used Chi-squared tests and GEE logistic regression to compare video vs. phone visits by age, urban/rural status, and race/ethnicity (American Indian / American Native [AIAN], Asian, Non-Hispanic Black/African American [NH Black/AA], Hispanic, Multiple, Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander [NHPI], NH White). Results: Over the study period, 42,171 telehealth visits were performed with 11,097 patients at the MCC. Patients had a mean age of 62.713.9 years;59.2% were female;88.7% lived in urban areas;90.0% of patients were NH White, 4.4% NH Black/AA, 3.0% Asian, 1.5% Hispanic, 0.8% AIAN, 0.3% of multiple races, and 0.1% NHPI. The most common cancer sites were breast (24.1%), hematological (21.0%), gynecologic (10.0%), and lung (8.4%). NH White individuals were more likely (53.9%) to use video than AIAN (39.7%), Black/AA (37.8%), or NHPI individuals (34.9%). Video use was less common among rural (45.3%) than urban (53.7%;p&lt;.0001) residents, and among individuals aged 65 or older (45.2%) vs. younger than 65 (59.5%;p&lt;.0001). In a logistic regression, adjusted for continuous age and urban/rural status, all race/ethnic groups except Multiple were less likely to use video than NH White individuals (vs. phone;Table). Conclusions: Our findings underscore disparities in telehealth use for cancer care across historically underserved populations.

The empirical evidence of the power of non-verbal communication to engage therapists and clients in therapeutic work, develop a positive and collaborative relationship between them, and display empathy is quite large. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, drawing from the therapists participation in an online survey. A sample of 137 psychotherapists with different therapy orientations and years of clinical practice participated in the study. Therapists conducted face-to-face therapy wearing face masks with existing and/or new clients. We performed an exploratory analysis, using descriptive statistics, to explore the psychotherapists evaluations regarding perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions. In a complementary rationale, we analyzed the therapists perspectives on their experience wearing face masks using the thematic analysis methodology. Results show that among 137 psychotherapists, 114 were attending both existing and new clients, whereas only 13 were seeing exclusively existing clients and 10 were working exclusively with new clients. Despite no major differences were found between conditions regarding the perceived impact of face masks on different therapy quality dimensions and strategies adopted, the qualitative analysis allowed us to expand the quantitative results and deepen understanding of psychotherapists experience.

Whereas HSV-1 infection increases the expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in host cells, CEP was effective indirectly inhibiting phosphorylation levels of the targets in PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, CEP markedly decreased G(0)/G(1) phase and increased G(2)/M phase cells and decreased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase1 (CDK1) and cyclinB1 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, CEP increased apoptosis in infected cells, reduced B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein levels, and increased the protein levels of Bcl-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved-caspase3, and nuclear IB kinase (IB). Collectively, CEP could arrest the cell cycle in the G(2)/M phase and induce apoptosis in infected cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, hence further reducing HSV-1 infection and subsequent reproduction.","output":"Cepharanthine Suppresses Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Replication Through the Downregulation of the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 has both astonished the world and raised concerns about their safety, perhaps because many people do not realize the decades long efforts for nucleic acid vaccines, both mRNA and DNA vaccines, including the licensure of several veterinary DNA vaccines.

Since then, his career has focused on the political dimensions of science and technology, technology policy and the politics of technology. Winner has addressed key intellectual questions of classical and modern political theory in order to debate how order, power, freedom, authority and justice had resonance within technological devices. More specifically, he has brought a new dimension into the field by addressing how these classic questions in political theory are often deeply embedded in technical and material frameworks.

Appropriate subgroup analysis should be conducted to ensure equitable vaccine outcomes for higher weight people. In this study, inclusion and exclusion criteria of registered clinical trial protocols were reviewed to determine the proportion of trials including higher weight people, and the proportion of trials conducting subgroup analyses of efficacy by BMI. Eligibility criteria of 249 trial protocols (phase I, II, III and IV) were analysed; 51 protocols (20.5%) specified inclusion of BMI > 30, 73 (29.3%) specified exclusion of BMI > 30, and 125 (50.2%) did not specify whether BMI was an inclusion or exclusion criterion, or if BMI was included in any health screenings or physical examinations during recruitment. Of the 58 protocols for trials in phase III and IV, only 2 (3.4%) indicated an intention to report subgroup analysis of vaccine efficacy by weight status. Higher weight people appear to be significantly under-represented in the majority of vaccine trials. This may result in reduced efficacy and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines for higher weight people and exacerbation of health inequities within this population group.

Based on individual participant data, extracted from three double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, psychometric networks were computed on observed Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale scores at baseline (N=1,554) and on predicted change scores at 24 weeks of follow-up for participants who received donepezil (N=797) or placebo (N=484). A novel conceptualization of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease was displayed through the baseline network, that had 90% (n=27) positive statistically significant (p<0.05) associations, and a most central aspect of ideational praxis. Following 24 weeks, treatment effects emerged via the differences between the change score networks. The donepezil network had more statistically significant (p<0.05) positive associations and a higher global strength (n=15; S=1.22; p=0.03), than the placebo network (n=8; S=0.57). This suggests that for those who were treated with donepezil compared with placebo, cognition is a more unified construct. The main aspects of change in cognitive impairment were comprehension of spoken language for the donepezil network and spoken language ability for the placebo network. Comprehension of spoken language apears to be most sensitive to psychopharmaceutical interventions and should therefore be closely monitored. Overall, our psychometric network analysis presents a new conceptualization of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, points to previously unknown treatment effects and highlights well-defined aspects of cognitive impairment that may translate into future treatment targets.","output":"Cognitive impairment networks in Alzheimer's disease: Analysis of three double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of donepezil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), named the etiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 Kazakhstan's border proximity to China has led to preventive measures in the country since January This study aims to evaluate the epidemiologic characters of the first recorded cases in Kazakhstan METHODS: Here, we reviewed the preparedness of the infection control and prevention procedures in Kazakhstan and evaluated the epidemiological characters of confirmed cases in Kazakhstan The data for COVID-19 cases recorded from March 13 to April 6, 2020, were obtained from the Sanitary Epidemiological Service Age, gender and their living place were recorded The severity of infection, geographical distribution, gender and age group of cases were analyzed RESULTS: Four phases of preventive measures used in respiratory infections have been implemented in Kazakhstan since January 6, 2020 The first case was recorded on March 13 During the period of March 13 and April 06, 629 cases with COVID-19 were recorded in Kazakhstan Of these, 45 patients recovered, six had resulted in death;535 (85%) of cases were mild and/or asymptomatic, 72 (11 5%) - moderate, 22 (3 5%) - severe Of these, 7 5% of the cases were registered as children and course was mild CONCLUSION: The cases are increasing in Kazakhstan as seen in other countries Currently, the strict implication of respiratory infection control measurement in public and health care services are still very important","output":"Epidemiologic character of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan: A preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an outbreak of an emerging disease the epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen may be largely unknown.

This review provides indications of CT chest in COVID-19 suspect, positive and recovered patients based on the current scientific evidence and our personal experience. CT chest is not indicated as a routine screening modality due to its poor sensitivity and specificity. However, it is useful in a small subset of COVID-19 suspects who test negative on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal/indeterminate chest X-ray (CXR) but have moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms and high index of clinical suspicion. CT chest is not indicated in every RT-PCR-positive patient and should be done only in specific clinical scenarios, where it is expected to significantly contribute in the clinical management such as COVID-19 patients showing unexplained clinical deterioration and/or where other concurrent lung pathology or pulmonary thromboembolism needs exclusion. Serial CXR and point-of-care ultrasound are usually sufficient to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT chest is also indicated in COVID-19-positive patients with associated co-morbidities (age> 65 yr, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune-compromise, etc.) who, despite having mild symptoms and normal/indeterminate CXR, record oxygen saturation of < 93 per cent at rest while breathing room air or de-saturate on six-minute walk test. Finally, CT chest plays a crucial role to rule out lung fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection who present with hypoxia/impaired lung function on follow up.

However, placebo-controlled evidence on these antidepressants for insomnia is still lacking. Therefore, the present trial aims to assess the effectiveness of low-dose amitriptyline (10C20 mg/day) and mirtazapine (7.5C15 mg/day) in patients with insomnia disorder with difficulty maintaining sleep or early-morning awakening problems in general practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Drug REdiscovery: low-dose Amitriptyline and Mirtazapine for INsomnia disorder in General practice (DREAMING) study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in about 50 general practices. Adults (18C85 years) with insomnia disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5) who ask their general practitioner (GP) for sleep medication when non-pharmacological treatment is deemed not effective, are eligible. Exclusion criteria: isolated sleep initiation problem, contraindications for or drugCdrug interactions with either amitriptyline or mirtazapine. Participants (n=156) will be randomly assigned to three parallel treatment groups of 16-week treatment with either amitriptyline (one or two tablets of 10 mg/day) or mirtazapine (one or two tablets of 7.5 mg/day) or placebo (one or two tablets) alongside usual GP care. All participants start and end with single dose, but dose can be doubled following GP consultation in week 3. Questionnaire assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 6, 12, 20 and 52.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study (March 16, 2020 to May 8, 2020). SETTING: Academic long-term chronic care facility (Boston, MA). PARTICIPANTS: Long-term care residents. METHODS: Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were obtained via electronic medical records and Minimum Data Set. Staff residence was inferred by zip codes. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using nasopharyngeal swabs. Residents were followed until discharge from facility, death, or up to 21 days. Risks of COVID-19 infection were modeled by generalized estimating equation to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of patient characteristics and staff community of residence. RESULTS: Overall 146 of 389 (37.5%) long-stay residents tested positive for COVID-19. At the time of positive test, 66 of 146 (45.5%) residents were asymptomatic. In the subsequent illness course, the most common symptom was anorexia (70.8%), followed by delirium (57.6%). During follow-up, 44 (30.1%) of residents with COVID-19 died. Mortality increased with frailty (16.7% in pre-frail, 22.2% in moderately frail, and 50.0% in frail; P < .001). The proportion of residents infected with COVID-19 varied across the long-term care units (range: 0%a??90.5%). In adjusted models, male sex (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07, 3.05), bowel incontinence (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.10, 3.52), and staff residence remained significant predictors of COVID-19. For every 10% increase in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive increased by 6% (95% CI 1.04, 1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Among long-term care residents diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly one-half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Predictors of COVID-19 infection included male sex, bowel incontinence, and staff residence in a community with a high burden of COVID-19.

Mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175).

The activity of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription is crucial for neural plasticity and molecular studies suggest its increase in the NAc of heroin addicts.

In humans, mutations in IL2RG can result in a total failure of T and natural killer (NK) lymphocyte development and nonfunctional B lymphocytes (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency; XSCID). Therefore, we sought to develop a non-murine model to study XSCID and the infectious diseases associated with IL2RG deficiency. We demonstrated that the Il2rg KO hamsters have a lymphoid compartment that is greatly reduced in size and diversity, and is impaired in function. As a result of the defective adaptive immune response, Il2rg KO hamsters developed a more severe human adenovirus infection and cleared virus less efficiently than immune competent wild-type hamsters. Because of this enhanced virus replication, Il2rg KO hamsters developed more severe adenovirus-induced liver pathology than wild-type hamsters.

DESIGN: Prospective interventional study. SETTING: Single fertility center. PATIENT(S): Ninety-three oocyte donors underwent programmed stimulation using estradiol in the follicular phase. Their previous unprogrammed cycles were used as historical controls. INTERVENTION(S): Donors received 8 mg of estradiol hemihydrate from day 2 till 1 day before the start of stimulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome measures studied were the number of oocytes retrieved, duration of stimulation, and total gonadotropin dose. The number of mature oocytes, oocyte maturation rate, fertilization rate, blastulation rate, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate were the secondary outcomes. RESULT(S): The average number of oocytes retrieved was higher in the study group (36.4 vs. 32.5). The duration of stimulation (9.22 vs. 9.21 days) and the total gonadotropin dose were similar (3,085.5 vs. 3,026 IU) between both groups. The mean number of mature oocytes retrieved was higher in the study group (30.1 vs. 26.3), but the maturation rate was similar (84.6% vs. 81.2%). The fertilization rate (77.8% vs. 78.7%), number of blastocysts, blastulation rate (32.7% vs. 33.2%), implantation rate (59.3% vs. 66.3%), and pregnancy rate (77.3% vs. 77.1%) showed no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION(S): Estradiol usage in the follicular phase alone is an effective and convenient option for cycle programming in oocyte donors.

Using water demand modeling that fuses an integrated water use database, we first simulated the water use in a business-as-usual (non-pandemic) scenario for essentially all urban areas in California. We then subtracted the business-as-usual water use from the actual use to isolate the changes caused solely by the pandemic response. We found that the pandemic response decreased Californias urban water use by 7.9%, which can be largely attributed to an 11.2% decrease in the commercial, industrial, and institutional sector that more than offset a 1.4% increase in the residential sector. The influence of the stay-at-home practices on urban water use is slightly stronger than the combined influences of all non-pandemic factors.

MSCs switch the classical inflammatory status of monocytes and macrophages towards a non-classical and anti-inflammatory phenotype. This is characterized by an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, a decreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and changes in the expression of cell membrane molecules and in metabolic pathways. The MSC modulation of monocyte and macrophage phenotypes seems to be critical for therapy effectiveness in several disease models, since when these cells are depleted, no immunoregulatory effects are observed. Here, we review the effects of living MSCs (metabolically active cells) and metabolically inactive MSCs (dead cells that lost metabolic activity by induced inactivation) and their derivatives (extracellular vesicles, soluble factors, extracts, and microparticles) on the profile of macrophages and monocytes and the implications for immunoregulatory and reparative processes.

Hospital admission varied by month, with incidence among Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino patients peaking earlier in the pandemic timeline (P < 0.001). Patients reporting Spanish as their primary language were significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU (odds ratio, 1.75; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients do not demonstrate significant racial/ethnic disparities in case fatality, suggesting that state-wide disparities in mortality rate are rooted in infection risk rather than hospital course.

MCPH is a group of diseases with genetic heterogeneity and has been reported by the Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man? (OMIM) database and associated with 25 different genes. It is known that MCPH cases are most frequently associated with abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene mutations. The ASPM protein consists of an N-terminal 81 IQ (isoleucine-glutamine) domain, a calponin-homology domain, and a C-terminal domain. It interacts with calmodulin and calmodulin-related proteins via the IQ domain and acts as a part in mitotic spindle function. The basic characteristics of cases with ASPM gene mutations are microcephaly (below -3 SD) present before 1 year of age, intellectual disability, and the absence of other congenital anomalies. Macroscopic organization of the brain is preserved in cases with ASPM mutation, and a decrease in brain volume, particularly gray matter volume loss and a simplified gyral pattern are observed. Cortical migration defects are a very rare finding in patients with ASPM mutations. In the present study, we aimed to discuss the clinical and genetic findings in 2 cases with cortical dysplasia in which truncated variants in the ASPM gene were detected, particularly in terms of genotype-phenotype correlation in comparison with the literature.","output":"Two New Cases of Primary Microcephaly with Neuronal Migration Defect Caused by Truncating Mutations in the ASPM Gene."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disulfide bonds were found to link the nonglycosylated envelope protein VP-2/M (19 kDa), encoded by open reading frame 6, and the major envelope glycoprotein VP-3 (25 to 42 kDa), encoded by open reading frame 5, of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). The two proteins comigrated in a complex of 45 to 55 kDa when the virion proteins were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions but dissociated under reducing conditions.

This provided the opportunity to investigate the role of school-age children and school settings for transmission. METHODS: We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children, teachers and the general working population in Luxembourg during two epidemic waves: a spring wave from March-April 2020 corresponding to general lockdown with schools being closed and May-July 2020 corresponding to schools being open. We assessed the number of secondary transmissions occurring in schools between May and July 2020 using routine contact tracing data. RESULTS: During the first wave in March-April 2020 when schools were closed, the incidence in pupils peaked at 28 per 100,000, while during the second wave in May-July 2020 when schools were open, incidence peaked 100 per 100,000. While incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in adults than in children during the first spring wave, no significant difference was observed during the second wave in early summer. Between May and July 2020, we identified a total of 390 and 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 90,150 school-age children and 11,667 teachers, respectively. We further estimate that 179 primary cases caused 49 secondary cases in schools. While some small clusters of mainly student-to-student transmission within the same class were identified, we did not observe any large outbreaks with multiple generations of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Luxembourg schools was limited during an early summer epidemic wave in 2020.

ResultsOverall 1,166 surveys were collected from participants aged 18-90 years (mean 52, SD of 19). Seventy-eight percent reported being likely to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Higher SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions were associated with: increasing age (OR: 1.04 95%CI [1.03-1.044]), being male (OR: 1.37, 95% CI [1.08 - 1.72]), residing in the least disadvantaged area quintile (OR: 2.27 95%CI [1.53 - 3.37]) and a self-perceived high risk of getting COVID-19 (OR: 1.52 95% CI [1.08 - 2.14]). However, 72% of participants did not believe that they were at a high risk of getting COVID-19. Findings regarding vaccines in general were similar except there were no sex differences. For both the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and vaccines in general, there were no differences in intentions to vaccinate as a function of education level, perceived income level, and rurality. Knowing that the vaccine is safe and effective, and that getting vaccinated will protect others, trusting the company that made it and getting vaccination recommended by a doctor were reported to influence a large proportion of the study cohort to uptake the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

These disruptions signi_cantly impact the consumer demands, which in turn a_ect the capacity and pro_tability of a supply chain network. Economic survivability is the ability to maintain a net positive economic worth, or at least keeping it above a certain threshold, in the presence of sudden and prolonged disruptions that drastically reduce the product demands, prices, resource availability or others. We address the economic survivability of geographically distributed interconnected networks under demand disruptions. We formulate and incorporate the necessary conditions for ensuring economic survivability in supply chain design. The overall problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Increasing the economic survivability in general also increases the return-on-investment (ROI) and profitability. However, for multi-regional, distributed and interdependent supply chains, a more balanced distribution of investment portfolio is important to improve the local survivability of each region, but it comes at the expense of overall or global profitability. We also observe that the economic survivability is negatively impacted by over-designing a supply chain to meet excess demands (typically from spot markets). Decision-makers should balance the trade-offs between survivability and excess demand satisfaction by thoroughly assessing the probability of positive and negative demand uctuations.","output":"Survivability-Aware Design and Optimization of Distributed Supply Chain Networks in the Post COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A woman with serious mental illness cycles between a state hospital, shelters, nursing homes, and psychiatric units, with no permanent place to land.","output":"Out Of Options For Patients With Serious Mental Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of emergency nursing process in intravenous thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction was discussed. 100 patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for intravenous thrombolysis. 50 patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction were treated from December 2018 to June 2019.

During ageing, adipose inflammation leads to the redistribution of fat to the intra-abdominal area (visceral fat) and fatty infiltrations in skeletal muscles, resulting in decreased overall strength and functionality. Lipids and their derivatives accumulate both within and between muscle cells, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, disturbing ?-oxidation of fatty acids, and enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to lipotoxicity and insulin resistance, as well as enhanced secretion of some pro-inflammatory cytokines. In turn, these muscle-secreted cytokines may exacerbate adipose tissue atrophy, support chronic low-grade inflammation, and establish a vicious cycle of local hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation that spreads systemically, thus promoting the development of sarcopenic obesity (SO). We call this the metabaging cycle. Patients with SO show an increased risk of systemic insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, associated chronic diseases, and the subsequent progression to full-blown sarcopenia and even cachexia. Meanwhile in many cardiometabolic diseases, the ostensibly protective effect of obesity in extremely elderly subjects, also known as the 'obesity paradox', could possibly be explained by our theory that many elderly subjects with normal body mass index might actually harbour SO to various degrees, before it progresses to full-blown severe sarcopenia.

Once vaccines become mass produced, they will have to be distributed to almost the entire population to prevent deaths and permit prompt economic recovery. The necessity to vaccinate a large number of people in a short period of time, and possibly with insufficient vaccine doses to cover most, creates in itself a new challenge for governments and health authorities: which population groups (by age or other criteria) should be targeted first and what sequence must be followed, if any at all, to achieve the minimum number of fatalities? In this work, we demonstrate the importance and impact of optimally planning the priorities for vaccine deployment by population groups using a modified SEIR-type model for the COVID-19 outbreak considering age-related groups. Finding the absolute guaranteed best solution of the mathematical optimisation problem may be hard, if even possible, and would likely require intense computational resources for every possible case study scenario. In this work, several strategies are evaluated and compared, in an attempt to approach the most effective possible vaccination priority sequence in an example case study using demographic and epidemiological data from Spain. The minimum total fatalities at the end of the vaccination campaign is the objective pursued. The population groups classifications are established based on relevant differences in mortality (due to their age) and risk-related behaviour such as their number of daily person-to-person interactions. Assuming a capacity limited constant vaccination rate, vaccination distribution strategies were evaluated for different vaccine effectiveness levels and different percentages of final vaccine population coverage. Our results unambiguously show how planning vaccination by priority groups can achieve dramatic reductions in total fatalities (more than 70% in some cases) compared to no prioritisation. The results also indicate in all cases, for all vaccine effectiveness and coverage values evaluated, that the criteria for groups vaccination priority should not be those with the highest mortality but rather those the highest number of daily person-to-person interactions. Strikingly, our results show in all cases, that prioritisation of groups with the highest mortality but less social interactions, may lead to significantly larger numbers of final total fatalities, even higher as if no group priorities were established at all. The explanation, clearly displayed by the mechanistic model, is that vaccination avoids infections that reduce mortality not only from the vaccinated group itself but also from the projected secondary and subsequent infections inflicted on the rest of the population by those vaccinated in that group. Precisely this amplification effect (exponential nature of the curve) appears to cause the larger reduction in total fatalities if the groups with the most interactions are vaccinated first. The possible contradiction of these results with some published recommendations highlight the importance of conducting an open comprehensive and rigorous analysis of this problem leaving behind any subjective preconceptions.","output":"Prioritisation of population groups with the most interactions for COVID-19 vaccination can substantially reduce total fatalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric care and outcomes.

It may occur after cataract surgery and may give rise to poor visual outcome, with reduced visual acuity and distortion of the central vision. MO is often self-limiting with spontaneous resolution, but a small proportion of people with chronic persistent MO may be difficult to treat. Chronic oedema may lead to the formation of cystic spaces in the retina termed 'cystoid macular oedema' (CMO). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in cataract surgery and may reduce the chances of developing MO. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review is to answer the question: is there evidence to support the prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs either in addition to, or instead of, topical steroids postoperatively to reduce the incidence of macular oedema (MO) and associated visual morbidity. SEARCH METHODS We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. Date last searched 2 September 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which adult participants had undergone surgery for age-related cataract. We included participants irrespective of their baseline risk of MO, in particular we included people with diabetes and uveitis. We included trials of preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs in conjunction with postoperative topical steroids. The comparator was postoperative topical steroids alone. A secondary comparison was preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs alone versus postoperative topical steroids alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using standard methods expected by Cochrane. We pooled data using a random-effects model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and considered the following: risk of bias of included studies, precision of the effect estimate, consistency of effects between studies, directness of the outcome measure and publication bias. MAIN RESULTS We identified 34 studies that were conducted in the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and South-East Asia. Over 5000 people were randomised in these trials. The majority of studies enrolled one eye per participant; a small subset (4 trials) enrolled a proportion of people with bilateral surgery. Twenty-eight studies compared NSAIDs plus steroids with steroids alone. Six studies compared NSAIDs with steroids. A variety of NSAIDs were used, including ketorolac, diclofenac, nepafenac, indomethacin, bromfenac, flurbiprofen and pranopfen. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. In general, the studies were poorly reported. We did not judge any of the studies at low risk of bias in all domains. Six studies were funded by industry, seven studies were funded from non-industry sources, and the rest of the studies did not report the source of funding.There was low-certainty evidence that people receiving topical NSAIDs in combination with steroids may have a lower risk of poor vision due to MO at three months after cataract surgery compared with people receiving steroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.76; eyes = 1360; studies = 5; I2 = 5%). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias in the included studies and indirectness, as the extent of visual loss was not always clear. Only one study reported poor vision due to MO at 12 months and we judged this to be very low-certainty evidence as there were only two events. Quality of life was only reported in one of the 34 studies comparing NSAIDs plus steroids versus steroids alone, and it was not fully reported, other than to comment on lack of differences between groups. There was evidence of a reduced risk of MO with NSAIDs at three months after surgery, but we judged this to be low-certainty due to risk of bias and publication bias (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.49; eyes = 3638; studies = 21). There was inconsistent evidence on central retinal thickness at three months (I2 = 87%). Results ranged from -30.9 m in favour of NSAIDs plus steroids to 7.44 m in favour of steroids alone. Similarly, data on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were inconsistent, but nine out of 10 trials reporting this outcome found between-group differences in visual acuity of less than 0.1 logMAR.None of the six studies comparing NSAIDs alone with steroids reported on poor vision due to MO at three or 12 months. There was low-certainty evidence that central retinal thickness was lower in the NSAIDs group at three months (mean difference (MD) -22.64 m, 95% CI -38.86 to -6.43; eyes = 121; studies = 2). Five studies reported on MO and showed a reduced risk with NSAIDs, but we judged this evidence to be of low-certainty (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.41; eyes = 520). Three studies reported BCVA at three months and the results of these trials were inconsistent, but all three studies found differences of less than 0.1 logMAR between groups.We did not note any major adverse events - the main consistent observation was burning or stinging sensation with the use of NSAIDs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Using topical NSAIDs may reduce the risk of developing macular oedema after cataract surgery, although it is possible that current estimates as to the size of this reduction are exaggerated. It is unclear the extent to which this reduction has an impact on the visual function and quality of life of patients. There is little evidence to suggest any important effect on vision after surgery. The value of adding topical NSAIDs to steroids, or using them as an alternative to topical steroids, with a view to reducing the risk of poor visual outcome after cataract surgery is therefore uncertain. Future trials should address the remaining clinical uncertainty of whether prophylactic topical NSAIDs are of benefit, particularly with respect to longer-term follow-up (at least to 12 months), and should be large enough to detect reduction in the risk of the outcome of most interest to patients, which is chronic macular oedema leading to visual loss.","output":"Prophylactic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of macular oedema after cataract surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the magnitude and duration of fecal viral DNA shedding after diagnosis of feline panleukopenia (FP) in a group of shelter cats using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR); to assess the utility of a negative point-of-care test or the resolution of diarrhea and systemic signs as proxy measures for qPCR positivity; and to investigate patterns of additional enteric pathogens in relation to feline panleukopenia viral shedding duration. METHODS: Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) infection in clinically affected shelter cats was confirmed by a commercial qPCR test. Observations were made on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 21 post-diagnosis. Fecal flotation, FPV qPCR and the canine parvovirus IDEXX SNAP Parvo ELISA (SNAP) test were performed on fecal samples. RESULTS: Forty cats and kittens with confirmed panleukopenia were initially enrolled. Sixteen kittens were sampled until day 14, and 12 were followed to day 21. Median DNA viral copy numbers fell below the diagnostic cut-off by day 7, with 13/16, 6/16, 1/16 and 0/12 testing PCR-positive on days 3, 7, 14 and 21, respectively. The SNAP test was positive in 12/16 kittens on day 0 and only 3/16 on day 3. SNAP test results, diarrhea and systemic signs were inconsistent in relation to qPCR positivity post-diagnosis. Additional enteric pathogens were common. The presence of additional pathogen types was suggestive of a longer PCR shedding duration, but this was not tested statistically owing to the small sample size. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that cats should be isolated for at least 14 days after a diagnosis of FP, but that release from isolation after this point is reasonable, in association with a multifaceted infection control strategy. The study findings did not support using SNAP test results, diarrhea or systemic signs as proxy measures for virus shedding.","output":"Fecal viral DNA shedding following clinical panleukopenia virus infection in shelter kittens: a prospective, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of SARS (2003) / new influenza (2009) / MARS (2013) and so on, thermography-based Fever Screening has been adopted in quarantine of airports and ports as a measure to prevent from the spread of infection.

Due to recent spread of COVID 19, installation of thermography is expanding not only to quarantine at airports and ports, but also to hospitals, schools, retail stores, various facilities, and sports/event venues. Automated fever screening system with high accuracy are needed. Generally, a thermometer that measures axillary or sublingual temperature is used for body temperature measurement accurately, but this method takes time and contacts the subject to measure. So it is not suitable for the screening. On the other hand, thermography, which can measure the temperature of several persons in real time in a non-contact manner, satisfies screening requirements, but the body surface temperature of the exposed part such as the face that can be measured, is strongly affected by the environmental temperature and fluctuates. Therefore, it has a problem that it is difficult to determine the presence or absence of fever by setting a constant threshold value only. In order to realize the automation of screening with high accuracy and efficiency and make it easy for general users to understand, we will increase the measurement accuracy of the body surface temperature of thermography, identify the face and each landmark position from the image, and measure the temperature (body surface) of that part.

Ophthalmic findings include best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), biomicroscopic examination, cycloplegic refraction, retinal examination, macular optical coherence tomography, and electroretinography. Genetic information was retrieved from the participating genetic clinics and included ethnicity and molecular diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one individuals met the inclusion criteria and had a secure molecular diagnosis. Mutations in two genes predominated, constituting 77.4% of all the represented genes: SLC38A8 (45.1%) and PAX6 (32.3%). Seventy-eight percent of the subjects who had a measurable BCVA had moderate and severe visual impairment (range 20/80 to 20/270).

METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that recruited 193 adolescents aged 12 and 16 years from government schools and directly from the community in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected for all enrolled participants. Blood was drawn and tested using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), and Early Secretory Antigenic Target-6CFree Interferon-gamma Release Assay (ESAT-6 free IGRA). Concordance between QFT-GIT and ESAT-6 free IGRA was evaluated using the McNemars test. RESULTS: Overall estimates of LTBI prevalence were 19.2% [95%CI, 14.1; 25.2] and 18.6% [95%CI, 13.6; 24.6] as measured by QFT-GIT IGRA and ESAT-6 free IGRA, respectively. The 16-year-old cohort had a higher LTBI prevalence (23.7% [95%CI, 16.1; 32.9]) as compared to 12-year-old cohort (14.6% [95%CI, 8.6; 22.7]) as measured by QFT-GIT IGRA. When measured by ESAT-6 Free IGRA, LTBI prevalence was 24.7% (95%CI, 16.9; 34.0) for the 16-year-old cohort and 12.5% (95%CI, 7.0; 20.3) among the 12-year-old cohort. According to both tests the prevalence of TB infection and the corresponding annual risk of tuberculosis infection (ARTI) and force of infection were high and increased with age. Of all enrolled participants, 97.4% had concordant results for QFT-GIT IGRA and ESAT-6 free IGRA (p = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LTBI and the associated ARTI and force of infection among adolescents is high and increases with age in Mwanza Region. There was a high concordance between the QFT-GIT and the novel ESAT-6 free IGRA assays. These findings suggest Mwanza is a promising area to conduct novel TB vaccine research prevention of infection (POI) studies targeting adolescents.","output":"Prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as measured by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay and ESAT-6 free IGRA among adolescents in Mwanza, Tanzania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During multi-step carcinogenesis, cancer cells accumulate driver mutations and the acquisition of evasion ability from the host immune surveillance.

This study estimated and compared COPD mortality and hospital morbidity rates and trends in these rates over time across countries and regions of Asia-Pacific. METHODS Data consistent with standard definitions of COPD (ICD-9/ICD-10) for the period 1991-2004 were obtained from national health statistics agencies. For countries/regions with complete national mortality and hospitalization data (Australia, Pacific Canada (British Columbia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan), annual age-standardized mortality and hospitalization rates were calculated for men and women aged >or= 40 years. Negative binomial regression modelling was used to estimate rate ratios for country/region, gender and age differences and general trends over time. RESULTS Mortality rates per 10,000 population ranged 6.4-9.2 in men, 2.1-3.5 in women and 3.7-5.3 overall in 2003. Corresponding ranges for morbidity were 32.6-334.7, 21.2-129 and 28.1-207.3 per 10 000. Trend analysis of data since 1997 produced annual percentage changes in mortality versus hospitalization of -4.4% versus -0.7% in Australia, -3.6% versus 7.5% in Pacific Canada (British Columbia), -7.15% versus -5.6% in Hong Kong and -2.9% versus -4.2% in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS In Asia-Pacific, overall mortality and morbidity rates are high and trends in mortality and morbidity vary between countries/regions.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection are at high risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome and adverse outcomes. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 present increased rates of preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks), cesarean delivery and neonatal admissions to the intensive care unit. Comorbidity such as diabetes (pregestational or gestational) or obesity further increased maternal and fetal complications. It is known that diabetic or obese patients with COVID-19 present an unfavorable course and a worse prognosis, with a direct association between worse outcome and suboptimal glycol-metabolic control or body mass index (BMI) levels. Critical COVID-19 infection prevention is important for both mother and fetus. Vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice. Vaccines against COVID-19 are distributed across the world with some population considered to have a priority. Since pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials very little information are available on safety and efficacy of COVD-19 vaccines during pregnancy. However, it is well known the concept of passive immunization of the newborn obtained with transplacental passage of protective antibodies into the fetal/neonatal circulation after maternal infection or vaccination. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 vaccine-induced IgG pass to the neonates through breastmilk. Therefore, maternal vaccination can protect mother, fetus and baby.

We aimed to construct a new nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) in middle-aged patients with hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage. METHOD: We collected clinicopathological information on early middle-aged patients with hepatocellular carcinoma from the SEER database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to screen the independent risk factors for prognosis. These risk factors were used to construct predictions of CSS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Consistency index (C- index), calibration curve, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were used. A decision analysis curve (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the predictive model. RESULTS: A total of 6,286 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in early middle age were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sex, marriage, race, histological tumor grade, T stage, surgery, chemotherapy, AFP, and tumor size were independent risk factors for prognosis. All independent risk factors were included in the nomogram to predict CSS at 1-, 3-, and 5-years in early middle age patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In the training cohort and validation cohort, the C-index of the prediction model was 0.728 (95%CI: 0.716C0.740) and 0.733 (95%CI: 0.715C0.751), respectively. The calibration curve showed that the predicted value of the prediction model is highly consistent with the observed value. AUC also suggested that the model has good discrimination. DCA suggested that the nomogram had better predictive power than T staging. CONCLUSION: We constructed a new nomogram to predict CSS in middle-aged patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.

This case report describes a first experience caring for a patient with COVID-19 who received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and expands the literature by discussing relevant nursing management and operational considerations. CLINICAL FINDINGS A 46-year-old man presented to a hospital emergency department with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, anorexia, and chills. The patient was intubated for pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSIS A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2, and chest radiography confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS After no improvement with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, the patient began receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center. Frontline critical care nurses played a vital role in coordinating patient care activities, monitoring changes in the patient's condition, and detecting complications early. OUTCOMES The patient was decannulated on day 15 and extubated on day 17. The patient was successfully discharged home on hospital day 24. CONCLUSION Caring for a patient with COVID-19 receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation posed unprecedented challenges that required deviations from standards of care to optimize infection control measures and staff safety while providing quality care.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of bladder acellular matrix (BAM) for reconstruction of clinically significant large urinary bladder wall defects in a long-term porcine model. Urinary bladders were harvested from 10 pig donors. Biological scaffolds were prepared by chemically removing all cellular components from urinary bladder tissue. A total of 10 female pigs underwent hemicystectomy and subsequent bladder reconstruction with BAM. The follow-up study was 6 months. Reconstructed bladders were subjected to radiological, macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular evaluations. Six out of ten animals survived the 6-month follow-up period. Four pigs died during observation due to mechanical failure of the scaffold, anastomotic dehiscence between the scaffold and native bladder tissue, or occluded catheter. Tissue engineered bladder function was normal without any signs of postvoid residual urine in the bladder or upper urinary tracts. Macroscopically, graft shrinkage was observed. Urothelium completely covered the luminal surface of the graft. Smooth muscle regeneration was observed mainly in the peripheral graft region and gradually decreased toward the center of the graft. Expression of urothelial, smooth muscle, blood vessel, and nerve markers were lower in the reconstructed bladder wall compared to the native bladder.

On the basis of this success, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) was developed using similar somatostatin analogs with different therapeutic radionuclides. Clinical application of PRRT demonstrated impressive results on tumor response, overall survival, and quality of life in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The peptides 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), Tyr(3)-octreotate (DOTATATE) and DOTA, Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTATOC) (brand name Onalta), predominantly targeting sst(2), have been granted Orphan Drug status by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for application in PRRT. Besides somatostatin receptor-targeting peptides, multiple other radiopeptide analogs were developed targeting several other receptors overexpressed on various tumors. Some of these peptide analogs, including cholecystokinin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-peptides, and glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs appeared very promising in preclinical and clinical imaging and PRRT studies. Although the success of PRRT with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs has been established, there is still room for improvement. The therapeutic window of PRRT could be enlarged by the use of new and improved targeting compounds, of which new antagonists with excellent tumor to background ratios are very promising. Furthermore, locoregional administration, improved healthy tissue protection, and combination treatment can be applied to increase the effectiveness of PRRT. Combination treatment might include cocktails of different peptide analogs of different therapeutic radionuclides and of radiolabeled peptides with chemotherapeutic or radiosensitizing agents.

The interurban multi-agent EP strategy, as a key component of this mechanism, includes the spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model, and the collaborative EP model. In this study, firstly, the theoretical mechanism of the interurban multi-agent EP strategy was analyzed. Then, we proposed a three-party differential game model including factors such as the risk coefficient for the virus infection and EP experience teaching. Finally, prevention strategies, prevention efficiency, and prevention losses were compared under the three models based on theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. The results of this study are as follows. COVID-19 EP should be guided by a model of central government (CG) leadership, interurban collaboration, and social participation. The CG and urban governments (UGs) should comprehensively carry out COVID-19 EP from various aspects, including EP experience teaching, mass EP comfort, the utilization rate of EP funds, and the ability to implement strategies. During the course of the COVID-19 EP, when the CG and UGs transition from spontaneous EP model to a higher-level EP model, the UG's EP efforts will be enhanced. Under the collaborative EP model, the CG and UGs undergo the highest levels of EP effort. Compared with spontaneous EP model, the superior leading EP model can promote a Pareto improvement for all parties. From the perspective of total loss, the collaborative EP model is superior to the other two EP models.

The influence of the infrastructure of NICUs on NIs is not well documented. This study aims to examine the effect of single-room units (SRU) versus open-bay units (OBU) on the incidence of NIs, including central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), in preterm neonates. METHODS: All preterm neonates (< 32 weeks gestational age) admitted to our NICU were included. Two study periods were compared: one prior to (May 2015CMay 2017) and one following (May 2017CMay 2019) transition from OBU to SRU. Incidence density (number of infections per 1000 patient-days) and cumulative incidence (number of infections per 100 neonates) for NIs were calculated. CLABSIs were calculated per 1000 central-line days. U chart analysis was performed to determine special-cause variation in quarterly CLABSI and NI rates. Multivariate competing risk regression was performed to identify independent NI risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 712 included infants, 164 (23%) infants acquired  1 NIs. No differences were found in incidence density (13.68 vs. 12.62, p = 0.62) or cumulative incidence of NI (23.97 vs. 22.02, p = 0.59) between OBU and SRU. CLABSIs showed a similar non-significant reduction after the move (14.00 vs. 10.59, p = 0.51). U chart analysis did not identify unit transition as a potential source of special-cause variation for CLABSI and NI. Competing risks regression analysis revealed longer duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as a significant risk factor for NI (subhazards ratio: 1.03 per day on ventilation, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Single-rooms are not associated with a significant reduction in NIs in the NICU. This study therefore does not add evidence that could support the transition to SRUs if based only on a large multimodal infection control strategy. Recommendations to build SRUs would require a wider justification, also taking into account other SRU benefits.

This study aimed to test whether NLR, PLR, CAR, and AFR serve as predictive markers of disease severity and systemic inflammation in patients with SJS/TEN. This retrospective study included 40 patients with SJS/TEN and 60 healthy controls. The correlation between these markers and severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN), ABCD-10, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed and compared. Univariable and multivariable analysis were used to assess associations of variables with mortality. The receiver-operator curves (ROC) were used to evaluate the predictive value of variables for mortality in SJS/TEN patients. The results demonstrated that the NLR and PLR of SJS/TEN patients were significantly higher and the AFR was significantly lower when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). The NLR and CAR were positively correlated with SCORTEN, ABCD-10, PCT, and CRP. The NLR in SCORTEN of 3 group was significantly higher than that in SCORTEN <3 group (p < 0.05) and there were no significant differences between PLR, CAR, and AFR between the two groups. The univariate analysis suggested that NLR of >5.79 was a risk factor for mortality (odds ratio, 10.5; p < 0.05), but the association was no longer statistically significant in multivariable analysis. The ROC showed that NLR had a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 63.6% for predicting death with a cut-off value of 5.79 (p < 0.05) in SJS/TEN patients.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an internationalization at home programme and to explore the learning experiences of medical and nursing students from Hong Kong and Indonesia. METHODS: Students were recruited from two universities in Hong Kong and Indonesia. They attended an online internationalization at home programme designed by members of the research team from both countries. A mixed-methods study was conducted using a concurrent triangulation approach. A pre-test post-test design was used to evaluate the effects of the programme on cultural awareness, and four focus groups were conducted to explore the students experiences in the programme. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed by T-test and reflexive thematic analysis, respectively. Data were integrated and triangulated using joint displays by comparing findings from both sources. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight students from Hong Kong and Indonesia participated in the study. After the programme, there was a significant improvement in cultural awareness. Three themes were identified: (1) learning process: enjoyable, but a desire remains for face-to-face cross-cultural communication; (2) learning outcomes: gained cultural awareness, developed cultural sensitivity, had an opportunity to practice language and learn about new learning styles; (3) factors influencing learning outcomes: facilitators (micro-movie and active communication) and barriers (language barrier, inappropriate time arrangement, insufficient prior briefing). CONCLUSION: This programme achieved the learning outcomes by successfully enhancing the cultural awareness of students during a time of pandemic when outbound student exchanges were not possible.

To better characterize a successful vaccination response, we performed longitudinal (days 0, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after Boostrix vaccination) analysis of the single-cell transcriptome as well as the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire (scBCR-rep) in plasma cells of an immunized donor and compared it with baseline B-cell characteristics as well as flow cytometry findings. Based on the flow cytometry knowledge and literature findings, we discriminated individual B-cell subsets in the transcriptomics data and traced over-time maturation of plasmablasts/plasma cells (PB/PCs) and identified the pathways associated with the plasma cell maturation. We observed that the repertoire in PB/PCs differed from the baseline B-cell repertoire e.g., regarding expansion of unique clones in post-vaccination visits, high usage of IGHG1 in expanded clones, increased class-switching events post-vaccination represented by clonotypes spanning multiple IGHC classes and positive selection of CDR3 sequences over time. Importantly, the Variable gene family-based clustering of BCRs represented a similar measure as the gene-based clustering, but certainly improved the clustering of BCRs, as BCRs from duplicated Variable gene families could be clustered together. Finally, we developed a query tool to dissect the immune response to the components of the Boostrix vaccine. Using this tool, we could identify the BCRs related to anti-tetanus and anti-pertussis toxoid BCRs. Collectively, we developed a bioinformatic workflow which allows description of the key features of an ongoing (longitudinal) immune response, such as activation of PB/PCs, Ig class switching, somatic hypermutation, and clonal expansion, all of which are hallmarks of antigen exposure, followed by mutation & selection processes.","output":"Longitudinal Dynamics of Human B-Cell Response at the Single-Cell Level in Response to Tdap Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent theories propose that abstract concepts, compared to concrete ones, might activate to a larger extent interoceptive, social and linguistic experiences. At the same time, recent research has underlined the importance of investigating how different sub-kinds of abstract concepts are represented. We report a pre-registered experiment, preceded by a pilot study, in which we asked participants to evaluate the difficulty of 3 kinds of concrete concepts (natural objects, tools, and food concepts) and abstract concepts (Philosophical and Spiritual concepts, PS, Physical Space Time and Quantity concepts, PSTQ, and Emotional, Mental State and Social concepts, EMSS). While rating the words, participants were assigned to different conditions designed to interfere with conceptual processing: they were required to squeeze a ball (hand motor system activation), to chew gum (mouth motor system activation), to self-estimate their heartbeats (interoception), and to perform a motor articulatory task (inner speech involvement). In a control condition they simply rated the difficulty of words. A possible interference should result in the increase of the difficulty ratings. Bayesian analyses reveal that, compared to concrete ones, abstract concepts are more grounded in interoceptive experience and concrete concepts less in linguistic experience (mouth motor system involvement), and that the experience on which different kinds of abstract and concrete concepts differs widely. For example, within abstract concepts interoception plays a major role for EMSS and PS concepts, while the ball squeezing condition interferes more for PSTQ concepts, confirming that PSTQ are the most concrete among abstract concepts, and tap into sensorimotor manual experience. Implications of the results for current theories of conceptual representation are discussed.","output":"Sensorimotor and interoceptive dimensions in concrete and abstract concepts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a part of measures to decrease spikes in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths outside of hospitals, the government of South Korea introduced a plan for community treatment centers (CTCs) to isolate and monitor patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.

This study also compared poor households with their near-poor counterparts with respect to economic resilience vis--vis the recession. Descriptive statistics showed that just 41 percent of the sample reached economic resilience in 2013, while multivariate logistic regression results indicated that poor households were 33 percent less resilient than near-poor households. This study holds major implications for policy and research. In fact, macro-level policy changes can have micro-level effects. Because stimulus packages are rare policy interventions, policymakers should ensure that such emergency-type of policy infusion works, including for those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Meanwhile, by revealing how financial crises and recovery efforts impact disadvantaged populations, the findings in this study have implications for future research.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the anastomotic leakage rate in laparoscopic rectal surgery according to the need of using one or two stapler firings for rectal transection. METHODS PubMed, Ovid, the Cochrane Library database and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. All of the statistical analyses were performed using Revman software. RESULTS Five studies were included (1267 patients). The overall anastomotic leakage rate was 5.5% [0.7-8.4%]. Anastomotic leak occurred in 3.5% (17/491) of the cases where 1 stapler firing was used versus 6.7% (50/786) of the cases in which 2 firings were needed (50/786). Two stapler firings were significantly associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.34-4.42, p = 0.003, I2 = 1%). CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that two firings imply a higher rate of anastomotic leak than a single firing after laparoscopic rectal surgery with a double stapling technique.

We performed an international multicenter randomized trial comparing SFV versus standard single forward view examination of RC on adenoma detection. METHODS Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopies from 6 Asia Pacific regions were invited for study. A forward view examination of RC was first performed in all patients, followed by randomization at hepatic flexure to either SFV examination of RC and standard withdrawal examination from hepatic flexure to rectum, or a standard withdrawal colonoscopy (SWC) examination from hepatic flexure to rectum. Primary outcome was RC ADR. RESULTS Between 2016 and 2019, 1011 patients were randomized (SFV group: 502, SWC group: 509). Forty-five endoscopists performed the colonoscopies. The RC ADR was significantly higher in the SFV group than the SWC group (27.1% vs 21.6%, p=0.042). The whole-colon ADR were high in both groups (49.0% vs 45.0%, p=0.201). SFV examination identified 58 additional adenomas in 49 patients (9.8%), leading to a change in surveillance recommendation in 15 patients (3.0%). The median overall withdrawal time was 1.5 minute longer in the SFV group (12.0 vs 10.5 minutes, p<0.001). Older age, male gender, ever smoking, and longer RC withdrawal time were independent predictors of right-sided adenoma detection. CONCLUSION In this multicenter trial, SFV examination significantly increased RC ADR in screening and surveillance colonoscopies. Routine RC SFV examination should be considered.

The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) was developed to assess patients perspectives of care received. However, successful application of this instrument in community pharmacies is uncertain. The objective of this study was to adapt the PACIC for use in community pharmacies (CP-PACIC), assess validity of the CP-PACIC and examine CP-PACIC scale score differences relative to patient characteristics. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed chronically ill adults in Indiana, US who receive care from pharmacists in community pharmacies. The modified CP-PACIC scale consisted of 20-items, which were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (always). The total possible score ranged from 0 C 80. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to assess performance and dimensionality. CP-PACIC validity, including face validity, construct validity (via exploratory factor analysis) and internal consistency were assessed. Relationships between patient characteristics and scale scores were evaluated using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-six respondents data were analyzed. EFA revealed a 2-factor solution (termed advanced pharmacy chronic illness care (AP) and traditional pharmacy chronic illness care (TP) subscales) accounting for 64.7% of variance; all 20 items were retained. The total 20-item CP-PACIC scale had a Cronbachs alpha (internal consistency) of 0.96; with a 12-item AP subscale Cronbachs alpha of 0.97 and 8-item TP subscale Cronbachs alpha of 0.89. Median total score was 12.0 [interquartile range = 27.3]. Median CP-PACIC sores varied across many respondent demographics (i.e., survey administration type, age, sex, education, health condition, number of pharmacy services received, community pharmacy type) such as whether respondents participated in one or more pharmacy service or not (29 vs. 10; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the original 5-subscale (patient activation, delivery system design, goal setting, problem solving, and follow-up/coordination) PACIC, analysis demonstrated a 2-factor (AP, TP) solution for the CP-PACIC scale with good internal consistency. As there are no standardized evaluation tools that exist, community pharmacies could find great value in using this CP-PACIC tool to benchmark performance and inform quality improvement strategies for patient care delivery.

88.3% of all 1,163,000 maids and housekeeping cleaners are female, and approximately half of them Latinas. Latinas are understudied and underrepresented in health research, particularly involving chemical exposure in cleaning practices, lack of job training, and inadequate access to personal protective equipment. The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to examine the knowledge (via training experiences), attitudes and behaviors of a heterogeneous group of Latinas who clean occupationally and 2) to assess their cleaning practices at work and at home. METHODS: This mixed-method study consisted of two phases: 1) three focus groups to explore knowledge (via training experiences), attitudes, and behaviors regarding cleaning practices (N = 15) and 2) a 43-question cross-sectional survey. Focus group audio recordings were analyzed using descriptive and in vivo coding and then coded inductively to explore thematic analysis. Statistical analysis of the survey evaluated means, frequency and percentage for each of the responses. RESULTS: Participants (n = 9) were women (mean age = 48.78 and SD = 6.72) from South America (n = 5), Mexico (n = 1), El Salvador (n = 1) and Dominican Republic (n = 2). The mean length of time living in the US was 18.78 years and over half (55.6%) worked in the cleaning industry for 10 or more years. Findings from the three focus groups (n = 15) included that training in cleaning often occurred informally at a very young age at home. Participants reported cleaning in groups where tasks are rotated and/or shared. Most were the primary person cleaning at home, suggesting increased exposure. Gloves and masks were the most frequently used PPE, but use was not consistent. For participants who purchase their own products, driving factors included price, smell and efficacy. Some participants used products supplied or preferred by the employer.

Results confirmed poor short-term prognosis to abnormal levels of some laboratorial indicators, such as LDH, CRP, lymphocytes, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. Our findings could also provide insights into COVID-19 research, such as key levels of fibrin degradation products, which are directly associated with the Dimerized plasmin fragment D and could indicate active coagulation and thrombosis.

Many of the foundational contributions to coccidioidomycosis research, including the discovery of the fungal disease agent, Coccidioides spp., were made by women. We review recent progress in Coccidioides research and big questions remaining in the field, while highlighting some of the contributions from women. RECENT FINDINGS: New molecular-based techniques provide a promising method for detecting Coccidioides, which can help determine the dominate reservoir host and ideal environmental conditions for growth. Genetic and genomic analyses have allowed an understanding of population structure, species level diversity, and evolutionary histories. We present a current, comprehensive genome list, where women contributed many of these entries. Several efforts to develop a coccidioidomycosis vaccine are underway. SUMMARY: Women continue to pioneer research on Coccidioides, including the relationships between the fungi and the environment, genetics, and clinical observations. Significant questions remain in the field of Coccidioides, including the main host reservoir, the relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation, and the underlying cause for chronic clinical coccidioidomycosis cases.","output":"A Review of Coccidioides Research, Outstanding Questions in the Field, and Contributions by Women Scientists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 is currently of global concern. Cancer patients are advised to stay at home in case of potential infection, which may cause delays of routine diagnosis and necessary treatment. How colorectal surgeons should manage this during the epidemic remains a big challenge. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of routine colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 and to offer some Chinese recommendations to colorectal surgeons throughout the world. METHODS: A total of 166 patients receiving colorectal surgery from 20th December 2019 to 20th March 2020 at Department of General Surgery in Chinese General Hospital of People's Liberation Army were enrolled, and further divided into two groups based on before or after admission date of 20th January 2020. Clinicopathologic data such as hospital stay and economic data such as total costs were collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Longer hospital stay, higher proportion of non\\\\local patients and more hospitalization cost were found in the post\\\\20 January group (special\\\\time group) (P < 0.001; P < 0.05; P < 0.05 respectively). Apart from this, no difference existed with regard to baseline demographical data such as age, sex and height, as well as clinicopathological data such as previous history, surgery time, operation extent and TNM staging. CONCLUSIONS: This real\\\\world study indicated that performing colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic might be safe and feasible based on comprehensive screening and investigation.

Yet it is difficult to determine just how much an individual reads. The Author Recognition Test (ART, Stanovich & West Reading Research Quarterly, 24(4), 402-433, 1989) and its multilingual adaptations are often used for quantifying exposure to print and have shown high validity and reliability in proficient readers in their dominant language (L1). When studying bilingualism and second language acquisition, it is ideal to have a single test which is equally reliable for all cohorts for comparison, but it is unclear whether ART is effective for speakers of English as foreign language (L2). This study assesses the reliability of ART in an English-medium university and college students with different language backgrounds. Following Moore and Gordon (Behavior Research Methods, 47(4), 1095-1109, 2015), we use item response theory (IRT) to determine how informative the test and its items are. Results showed an expected gradient in ART performance, with L1 speakers showing higher scores than L2 speakers of English, university students showing higher scores than college students, and both cohorts performing better than students in an English as a second language (ESL) university pre-admission program. IRT analyses further revealed that ART is not an informative measure for L2 speakers of English, as most L2 participants show a floor effect. Reasons for this unreliability are discussed, as are alternative measures of print exposure.","output":"Is the author recognition test a useful metric for native and non-native english speakers?

However, the willingness for vaccination is deeply influenced by several factors. So the aim of our review was to analyze the theme of vaccine hesitancy during COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on vaccine hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccine. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: In November 2020, we performed a search for original peer-reviewed articles in the electronic database PubMed (MEDLINE). The key search terms were \\"Vaccine hesitancy AND COVID-19\\". We searched for studies published during COVID-19 pandemic and reporting information about the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review. The percentage of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was not so high (up to 86.1% students or 77.6% general population); for influenza vaccine, the maximum percentage was 69%. Several factors influenced the acceptance or refusal (ethnicity, working status, religiosity, politics, gender, age, education, income, etc.). The most given reasons to refuse vaccine were as follows: being against vaccines in general, concerns about safety/thinking that a vaccine produced in a rush is too dangerous, considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless nature of COVID-19, general lack of trust, doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine, belief to be already immunized, doubt about the provenience of vaccine.

Countries across Asia have imposed these containment measures to varying extents. However, residents in different countries would have a differing degree of compliance to these containment measures potentially due to differences in the level of awareness and motivation in the early phase of pandemic. OBJECTIVES: In our study, we aimed to describe and correlate the level of knowledge and attitude with the level of compliance with personal hygiene and physical distancing practices among Asian countries in the early phase of pandemic. METHODS: A multinational cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May and June 2020 across 14 geographical areas. Subjects aged 21 years and above were invited to participate through social media, word of mouth and electronic mail. RESULTS: Among the 2574 responses obtained, 762 (29.6%) participants were from East Asia and 1812 (70.4%) were from Southeast Asia (SEA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled tonsillar, conjunctival and nasal cavity swabs from asymptomatic client-owned dogs (n=133) were tested using a real-time polymerase chain reaction canine respiratory panel. Identical samples from asymptomatic dogs in an animal shelter (n=295) were similarly tested for selected pathogens. Risk differences were calculated between client-owned dogs and shelter dogs for each of the respiratory pathogens included in the analyses. RESULTS: A total of 15 of 133 (11.3%) asymptomatic client-owned dogs were positive for at least one pathogen in the complex. Seven dogs (6.1%) were positive for M. cynos, six (5.2%) were positive for B. bronchiseptica, two (1.7%) were positive for canine herpesvirus type 1 and two (1.7%) were positive for canine respiratory coronavirus. For all eight pathogens tested in both groups, the proportion of positive cases was higher among shelter dogs than among client-owned dogs. Shelter dogs had a higher risk for M. cynos (0.18, 95% confidence interval: 0.12 to 0.25), canine respiratory coronavirus (0.15, 95% confidence interval: 0.10 to 0.19), canine distemper virus (0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.09), and canine pneumovirus (0.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.08) than client-owned dogs. Odds ratios for M. cynos (0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.08 to 0.92) and canine respiratory coronavirus (0.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.18) were significantly different between client-owned and shelter dogs. In all cases except for canine herpesvirus type 1, dogs within the shelter population were observed to be at higher risk of exhibiting asymptomatic carriage of a respiratory pathogen as compared to client-owned dogs. The strength of this association was strongest for M. cynos and canine respiratory coronavirus. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The risk of canine infectious respiratory disease pathogen exposure posed by asymptomatic client-owned dogs is poorly defined. This study also corroborates previous reports of high canine infectious respiratory disease prevalence among clinically healthy shelter dogs, and further determined that the overall prevalence of canine infectious respiratory disease pathogen carriage among clinically healthy client-owned dogs is low but is highest for the traditional pathogen B. bronchiseptica and the emerging pathogen M. cynos.","output":"Asymptomatic carriage of canine infectious respiratory disease complex pathogens among healthy dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is essential to know the proportion of health care workers (HCW) who are COVID 19 positive, as well as the severity and mortality among them.

Results confirmed shame as the emotion preferred to induce in violators, with this preference linked to higher use of engagement strategies (i.e. to make transgressors understand what they did wrong). Finally, empathy was positively linked to higher affect worsening and wanting stricter rules to be enforced.

A further prospective cohort of patients, consecutively enrolled after the first cohort was accomplished, was used as a secondary validation dataset. The two cohorts were evaluated jointly in an exploratory multivariable logistic regression model to assess prognostic variables on survival. RESULTS: In the primary intention-to-treat (ITT) phase 2 population, 180/301 (59.8%) subjects received tocilizumab, and 67 deaths were observed overall. Lethality rates were equal to 18.4% (97.5% CI: 13.6C24.0, P = 0.52) and 22.4% (97.5% CI: 17.2C28.3, P < 0.001) at 14 and 30 days, respectively.

In the exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio negatively affected survival, while the concurrent use of steroids was associated with greater survival. A statistically significant interaction was found between tocilizumab and respiratory support, suggesting that tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline.

Although Australia and New Zealand have not been affected as much as some other countries, resuscitation may still pose a risk to health care workers and necessitates a change to our traditional approach. This consensus statement for adult cardiac arrest in the setting of COVID\\\\19 has been produced by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and aligns with national and international recommendations. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: In a setting of low community transmission, most cardiac arrests are not due to COVID\\\\19. Early defibrillation saves lives and is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. Compression\\\\only cardiopulmonary resuscitation is thought to be a low risk procedure and can be safely initiated with the patient's mouth and nose covered. All other resuscitative procedures are considered aerosol generating and require the use of airborne personal protective equipment (PPE). It is important to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection. Methods to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID\\\\19 include a physical barrier such as a towel or mask over the patient's mouth and nose, appropriate use of PPE, minimising the staff involved in resuscitation, and use of mechanical chest compression devices when available. If COVID\\\\19 significantly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT: The changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all health care workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations.

METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. \\"First come, first served\\" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","output":"Adult ICU Triage During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Who Will Live and Who Will Die?

This research analyzes the intention of actors within a hospital to use an IPS to address this gap. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the intentions of hospital visitors and employees (as the main actors in a hospital) to use an IPS in a hospital. METHODS: The reasoned action approach was used, according to which the behavior of an individual is caused by behavioral intentions that are affected by (1) a persuasion that represents the individuals attitude toward the behavior, (2) perceived norms that describe the influence of other individuals, and (3) perceived norms that reflect the possibility of the individual influencing the behavior. RESULTS: The survey responses of 323 hospital visitors and 304 hospital employees were examined separately using SmartPLS 3.3.3. Bootstrapping procedures with 5000 subsamples were used to test the models (one-tailed test with a significance level of .05). The results show that attitude (=.536; P<.001; f2=.381) and perceived norms (=.236; P<.001; f2=.087) are predictors of hospital visitors intention to use an IPS.

CONCLUSIONS: This study has two major implications: (1) our extended reasoned action approach model, which takes into account spatial abilities and personal innovativeness, is appropriate for determining hospital visitors and employees intention to use an IPS; and (2) hospitals should invest in implementing IPS with a focus on (a) navigational services for hospital visitors and (b) asset tracking for hospital employees.","output":"Factors Influencing the Intention of Actors in Hospitals to Use Indoor Positioning Systems: Reasoned Action Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long COVID, defined as presence of COVID-19 symptoms 28 days or more after clinical onset, is an emerging challenge to healthcare systems.

This study sought to understand the genetic association of this polymorphic system with risk of disease in Iraqi patients. Two outcomes of COVID-19, recovery and death, were also explored. ABO blood groups were determined in 300 hospitalized COVID-19 Iraqi patients (159 under therapy, 104 recovered, and 37 deceased) and 595 healthy blood donors. The detection kit for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA (PCR-Fluorescence Probing) was used in the diagnosis of disease. RESULTS: Mean age was significantly increased in patients compared to controls (49.8  11.7 vs. 28.9  6.6 years; p < 0.001). A similar observation was made in recovered (42.1  10.4 vs. 28.9  6.6 years; p < 0.001) and deceased (53.6  9.7 vs. 28.9  6.6 years; p < 0.001) cases. The mean age was also significantly increased in deceased cases compared to recovered cases (53.6  9.7 vs. 42.1  10.4 years; p < 0.001). There were gender-dependent differences in COVID-19 prevalence. The percentage of COVID-19 was higher in males than in females (all cases: 59.7 vs. 40.3%; recovered cases: 55.8 vs. 44.2%). Such male-gender preponderance was more pronounced in deceased cases (67.6 vs. 32.4%).

Given the dangerousness and the extent of the contagion, almost no one has questioned the suggestions that these experts have advised policymakers to implement. Quite often the latter explicitly sought experts' advice and justified unpopular measures (e.g., restricting people's freedom of movement) by referring to the epistemic authority attributed to experts. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the basis of this epistemic authority and the reasons why in this case it has not been challenged, contrary to the widespread tendency to devalue expertise that has been observed in recent years. In addition, in relation to the fact that experts' recommendations are generally technical and supposedly neutral, we note that in the COVID-19 crisis different experts have suggested different public health policies. We consider the British case of herd immunity and the US case of the exclusion of disabled people from medical care. These decisions have strong axiological implications and affect people profoundly in very sensitive domains. Another goal is, therefore, to argue that in such cases experts should justify their recommendations-which effectively become obligations-by the canons of public reason within the political process because when values are involved it is no longer just a matter of finding the best technical solution, but also of making discretionary choices that affect citizens and that cannot be imposed solely on the basis of epistemic authority.","output":"The Role of Experts in the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Limits of Their Epistemic Authority in Democracy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Timing of elective tracheotomy in the intensive care unit for intubated patients with COVID-19 is still unclear.

Here, we report the outcomes of a survey on physical, verbal, and sexual violence experienced by adolescents in West Java, an Indonesian province inhabited by 18% of the countrys total population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2017 using the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) questionnaire for detecting child abuse; an expert panel translated, simplified, and validated it based on a theoretical framework that combines paediatrics, public health, and medicolegal perspectives. We aimed to cover a large sample size and explore three types of violence (physical, verbal, and sexual) that have high evidentiary value in the forensic context. The respondents were adolescents in the first and second grades of middle school (12 to 14 years old) and high school (15 to 17 years old) in seven cities/municipalities in the province, selected through several stages of simple random sampling (N = 3452). We analysed the samples through univariate (percentage), odds ratio (OR), comparison, correlation, and correspondence analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that 78.7% of the adolescents experienced violence in 2017, comprising those who encountered at least one incidence of physical violence (43.1%), verbal violence (12.2%), and sexual violence (4.5%). Data overlap includes 14.3% who experienced one type of violence in 2017, 7.4% who experienced two forms of violence, and 1.4% who underwent all three kinds of violence. The offenders were mainly adolescents across all types of violence, except for being forced to engage in sexual intercourse. Several victims of sexual violence did not state who the offenders were. Further, several characteristics showed a higher chance of experiencing violence than other characteristics, especially for adolescents who were still in middle school and those who lived only with their mothers. Correspondence analysis suggested subtle differences between characteristics.

The clinical and CT features were analyzed and compared. Findings Compared with the non-pregnant adults group (n = 14), initial normal body temperature (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]), leukocytosis (8 [50%] and 9 [36%]) and elevated neutrophil ratio (14 [88%] and 20 [80%]), and lymphopenia (9 [56%] and 16 [64%]) were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (n = 16) and clinically-diagnosed (n = 25) pregnant groups. Totally 614 lesions were detected with predominantly peripheral and bilateral distributions in 54 (98%) and 37 (67%) patients, respectively. Pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) was the predominant presence in 94/131 (72%) lesions for the non-pregnant adults. Mixed consolidation and complete consolidation were more common in the laboratory-confirmed (70/161 [43%]) and clinically-diagnosed (153/322 [48%]) pregnant groups than 37/131 (28%) in the non-pregnant adults (P = 0007, P < 0001). GGO with reticulation was less common in 9/161 (6%) and 16/322 (5%) lesions for the two pregnant groups than 24/131 (18%) for the non-pregnant adults (P = 0001, P < 0001). The pulmonary involvement in children with COVID-19 was mild with a focal GGO or consolidation. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up CT, revealing progression in 9/13 (69%) at 3 days whereas improvement in 8/10 (80%) at 6C9 days after initial CT scans. Interpretation Atypical clinical findings of pregnant women with COVID-19 could increase the difficulty in initial identification. Consolidation was more common in the pregnant groups. The clinically-diagnosed cases were vulnerable to more pulmonary involvement. CT was the modality of choice for early detection, severity assessment, and timely therapeutic effects evaluation for the cases with epidemic and clinical features of COVID-19 with or without laboratory confirmation.

Initially, CFEO exhibited strong mushroom tyrosinase activity in the cell-free mushroom tyrosinase assay system with an IC(50) value of 2.72 g/mL. Next, treatment with CFEO significantly as well as dose-dependently reduced a combination of -melanocyte-stimulating hormone and forskolin (-MSH-FSK)-induced melanin synthesis in B16-F10 cells. Indeed, 80 g/mL CFEO completely inhibited melanin production, which is similar to that of control cells. Further studies revealed that treatment with CFEO significantly inhibited melanogenesis regulatory proteins, including TRP-1, TRP-2, and MITF, whereas tyrosinase was unaffected by either -MSH-FSK or CFEO. In addition, the composition of the CFEO was characterized. The major components of CFEO were -terpineol (23.47%), shonanic acid (10.45%), terpinen-4-ol (12.23%), thymol (5.3%), piperitone (3.44%), berbenone (2.81%), thujic acid (1.65%), and chaminic acid (0.13%). Among them, shonanic acid (1), thujic acid (2), and chaminic acid (3) were uncommon constitutes in essential oils, which could be the index compounds of CFEO, and the structure of these compounds were confirmed by spectral analysis. Furthermore, we found that thymol is an active ingredient responsible for CFEOs anti-melanogenic activity.

Evidence shows that the severity of COVID-19 infection is compounded by its effects on nutrition, most especially for the critically ill. As such, nutrition societies have recommended optimization of oral diets and oral nutritional supplements followed by early enteral nutrition if nutritional targets are not met, and parenteral nutrition in the distal end of the spectrum.

Interpretation: In the UK, alcohol use increased in up to 30% of the population during COVID-19, resulting from a combination of factors including poor inhibitory control and stress. It is critical in future lockdowns that clinicians and public health officials are aware of the challenges faced by different age groups, and prioritise and personalise interventions and prevention measures appropriately.

There have been several reports of infrequent post vaccine associated thrombotic events, in particular for adenovirus\\\\based vaccines. These have variously been termed VIPIT (vaccine\\\\induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia), VITT (vaccine\\\\induced [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), VATT (vaccine\\\\associated [immune] thrombotic thrombocytopenia), and TTS (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome). In this report, the laboratory test processes, as utilised to assess suspected VITT, are reviewed. In published reports to date, there are notable similarities and divergences in testing approaches, potentially leading to identification of slightly disparate patient cohorts. The key to appropriate identification/exclusion of VITT, and potential differentiation from heparin\\\\induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT), is identification of potentially differential test patterns. In summary, testing typically comprises platelet counts, D\\\\dimer, fibrinogen, and various immunological and functional assays for platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. In suspected VITT, there is a generally highly elevated level of D\\\\dimer, thrombocytopenia, and PF4 antibodies can be identified by ELISA\\\\based assays, but not by other immunological assays typically positive in HITT. In addition, in some functional platelet activation assays, standard doses of heparin have been identified to inhibit activation in suspected VITT, but they tend to augment activation in HITT. Conversely, it is also important to not over\\\\diagnose VITT, given that not all cases of thrombosis post vaccination will have an immune basis and not all PF4\\\\ELISA positive patients will be VITT.","output":"Laboratory testing for suspected COVID\\\\19 vaccineCinduced (immune) thrombotic thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a case of chronic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with lymphoma and associated B-cell immunodeficiency.

In the present research paper, we present a brief study aiming to predict the probability of reaching a new record number of COVID-19 cases in Lebanon, based on the record theory, giving more insights about the rate of its quick spread in Lebanon. The main advantage of the records theory resides in avoiding several statistical constraints concerning the choice of the underlying distribution and the quality of the residuals. In addition, this theory could be used, in cases where the number of available observations is somehow small. Moreover, this theory offers an alternative solution in case where machine learning techniques and long-term memory models are inapplicable because they need a considerable amount of data to be performant. The originality of this paper lies in presenting a new statistical approach allowing the early detection of unexpected phenomena such as the new pandemic COVID-19. For this purpose, we used epidemiological data from Johns Hopkins University to predict the trend of COVID-2019 in Lebanon. Our method is useful in calculating the probability of reaching a new record as well as studying the propagation of the disease. It also computes the probabilities of the waiting time to observe the future COVID-19 record.

Accumulated evidences confirm that fertility and reproductive function have been adversely affected by exposure to chemical contaminants released in the environment. Today, the impact of diet and behavior on reproductive processes is also receiving special attention from the scientific community. Indeed, a close relationship between diet and fertility has been proven. Furthermore, a combination of unhealthy behavior, such as exposure to hazardous compounds and stress factors, poses living organisms at higher risk of reprotoxic effects. In particular, it has been described that poor life behaviors are associated with reduced male and female fertility due to decreased gamete quality and function. Most of the erroneous behaviors are, furthermore, a source of oxidative stress that, leading to epigenetic alterations, results in an impaired reproductive fitness. This review reports the detrimental impact of the most common environmental chemical stressors, diet, and behavior on reproductive functionality and success.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among n=93 index children (now age 29yr) and their mothers (all women). We collected peripheral and central blood pressure (BP) variables, and conducted a cognitive assessment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) instrument and analysed the association of BP variables with global cognitive tests and specific domains. Results: Forty percent of the pooled sample had low MoCA total scores, and 32% of the total sample had hypertension. No associations were found in the regression analysis between BP related variables and total MoCA scores. Also, no associations were found between peripheral and central BP variables with individual cognitive domains when stratified by age. A significant relationship was found between mean pressure and low visual perception (i.e. the ability to interpret information that is seen and give it meaning; p=0.02). Conclusion: Central mean pressure is associated with low visual perception domain among black women.

The A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203) and A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213) viruses are consistently lethal to domestic chickens but differ in their pathogenicity to mammals. Insertion of the VN1203 HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes into recombinant HK213 virus expanded its tissue tropism and increased its lethality in mice; conversely, insertion of HK213 HA and NA genes into recombinant VN1203 virus decreased its systemic spread and lethality. The VN1203 and HK213 HAs differ by 10 aa, and HK213 HA has shown greater binding affinity for synthetic alpha2,6-linked sialyl receptor. Introduction of an S227N change and removal of N-linked glycosylation at residue 158 increased the alpha2,6-binding affinity of VN1203 HA. Recombinant VN1203 virus carrying the S227N change alone or with the residue-158 glycosylation site removed showed reduced lethality and systemic spread in mice but not in domestic chickens. Wild-type VN1203 virus exhibited the greatest efficiency in systemic spread after intramuscular inoculation and in infection of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and conventional pulmonary dendritic cells.

We analysed all South Korean patients aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, and received general health examination results from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. Findings: Between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, 133 609 patients (70 050 [524%] female and 63 559 [476%] male) completed the general health examination and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 4365 (33%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 8297 (62%) were diagnosed with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

Participants were a random sample of adult patients undergoing orthopedic total joint, orthopedic spine, oncologic gynecological, thoracic, general, colorectal, open vascular, plastic, or open urological surgery requiring general or regional anesthesia. Surgeons and their associated patients were randomized 1:1 via a random number generator to treatment group or to usual care. Observers were masked to patient groupings during assessment of outcome measures. Interventions Sustained improvements in perioperative hand hygiene, vascular care, environmental cleaning, and patient decolonization efforts. Main Outcomes and Measures Perioperative S aureus transmission assessed by the number of isolates transmitted and the incidence of transmission among patient care units (primary) and the incidence of surgical site infections (secondary). Results Of 236 patients (156 [66.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 57 [15] years), 106 (44.9%) and 130 (55.1%) were allocated to the treatment and control groups, respectively, received the intended treatment, and were analyzed for the primary outcome. Compared with the control group, the treatment group had a reduced mean (SD) number of transmitted perioperative S aureus isolates (1.25 [2.11] vs 0.47 [1.13]; P = .002). Treatment reduced the incidence of S aureus transmission (incidence risk ratio; 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = .008; with robust variance clustering by surgeon: 95% CI, 0.42-0.76; P < .001). Overall, 11 patients (4.7%) experienced surgical site infections, 10 (7.7%) in the control group and 1 (0.9%) in the treatment group.

For the chemical system, creating both visual and verbal explanations improved learning without new teaching. Creating a visual explanation was superior and benefitted participants of both high and low spatial ability. Visual explanations often included crucial yet invisible features. The greater effectiveness of visual explanations appears attributable to the checks they provide for completeness and coherence as well as to their roles as platforms for inference.

However, until now, the flaws caused by indoor multipath propagation formed a fundamental hurdle for the adoption of such technology in practical healthcare applications where reliability and robustness are crucial. Multipath reflections, originated from one person, combine with the direct signals and multipaths of other people and stationary objects, thus jeopardizing individual vital signs extraction and localization. This work focuses on tackling indoor multipath propagation. METHODS We describe a methodology, based on accurate models of the indoor multipaths and of the radar signals, that enables separating the undesired multipaths from desired signals of multiple individuals, removing a key obstacle to real-world contactless vital signs monitoring and localization. RESULTS We also demonstrated it by accurately measure individual heart rates, respiration rates, and absolute distances (range information) of paired volunteers in a challenging real-world office setting. CONCLUSION The approach, validated using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, was shown to function in an indoor environment where radar signals are severely affected by multipath reflections.

Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"basic reproduction number\\" or \\"R0.\\" The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.381.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic. The estimated overall R0 was higher than the World Health Organization estimate.","output":"Estimate of the Basic Reproduction Number for COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dental calculus, the calcified form of the mammalian oral microbial plaque biofilm, is a rich source of oral microbiome, host, and dietary biomolecules and is well preserved in museum and archaeological specimens. Despite its wide presence in mammals, to date, dental calculus has primarily been used to study primate microbiome evolution. We establish dental calculus as a valuable tool for the study of nonhuman host microbiome evolution, by using shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of the oral microbiome in species as diverse as gorillas, bears, and reindeer. We detect oral pathogens in individuals with evidence of oral disease, assemble near-complete bacterial genomes from historical specimens, characterize antibiotic resistance genes, reconstruct components of the host diet, and recover host genetic profiles. Our work demonstrates that metagenomic analyses of dental calculus can be performed on a diverse range of mammalian species, which will allow the study of oral microbiome and pathogen evolution from a comparative perspective. As dental calculus is readily preserved through time, it can also facilitate the quantification of the impact of anthropogenic changes on wildlife and the environment.","output":"Dental Calculus as a Tool to Study the Evolution of the Mammalian Oral Microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objectives This study aimed to examine the link between human mobility and the number of COVID-19 infected people in countries. Study Design Our dataset covers 144 countries for which complete data are available. In order to analyze the link between human mobility and COVID-19 infected people, our study focused on the volume of air travel, the number of airports and the Schengen system. Methods In order to analyze the variation in COVID-19 infected people in countries, we used negative binomial regression analysis. Results Our findings suggest a positive relationship between higher volume of airline passenger traffic carried in a country and higher numbers of COVID-19 patients. We further found that countries which have a higher number of airports are associated with higher number of COVID-19 cases. Schengen countries, countries which have higher population density and higher percentage of elderly population are also found to be more likely to have more COVID-19 cases than other countries. Conclusions The paper brings a novel insight into the COVID-19 pandemic from a human mobility perspective. Future research should assess the impacts of the scale of sea/bus/car travel on the epidemic.

As a collateral effect, these changes have exacerbated the circulation of viruses and challenged our ability to prevent, control, and/or eliminate impactful swine diseases. Recent pandemic events in human and animal health, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 and African swine fever virus, highlight the fact that clinical observations are too slow and inaccurate to form the basis for effective health management decisions: systematic processes that provide timely, reliable data are required. Oral fluid-based surveillance reflects the adaptation of conventional testing methods to an alternative diagnostic specimen. The routine use of oral fluids in commercial farms for PRRSV and PCV2 surveillance was first proposed in 2008 as an efficient and practical improvement on individual pig sampling. Subsequent research expanded on this initial report to include the detection of 23 swine viral pathogens and the implementation of oral fluid-based surveillance in large swine populations (> 12,000 pigs).

Within the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection that is frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing challenge in the care of critically ill patients. Escalating rates of antibiotic resistance add substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and cost related to infection in the ICU. Both gram-positive organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus , and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter species, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae , such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemaseCproducing bacteria, and extended spectrum -lactamase organisms, have contributed to the escalating rates of resistance seen in VAP and other nosocomial infections. The rising rates of antimicrobial resistance have led to the routine empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics even when bacterial infection is not documented. Moreover, there are several new broader-spectrum antibiotics that have recently become available and others scheduled for approval in the near future. The challenge to ICU clinicians is how to most effectively utilize these agents to maximize patient benefits while minimizing further emergence of resistance. Use of rapid diagnostics may hold the key for achieving this important balance.

The present prospective study explored whether emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) predicted later PTSS related to the COVID-19 global pandemic in a solely American Indian sample. METHODS: American Indian participants (N = 210; Mean (SD) age = 54.85(13.08) years, 58.7% female) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) during Phase 1 (a few weeks before pandemic declaration) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic during Phase 2 (7-8 weeks after pandemic declaration). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized. RESULTS: ERQ reappraisal was negatively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher reappraisal predicted lower PTSS. In contrast, ERQ suppression was positively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher suppression predicted higher PTSS.

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses use intracellular machineries and pathways for efficient replication in their host target cells. Interestingly, certain viruses, and, more especially, enveloped viruses belonging to different viral families and including human pathogens, can mediate cell-cell fusion between infected cells and neighboring non-infected cells. Depending of the cellular environment and tissue organization, this virus-mediated cell-cell fusion leads to the merge of membrane and cytoplasm contents and formation of multinucleated cells, also called syncytia, that can express high amount of viral antigens in tissues and organs of infected hosts. This ability of some viruses to trigger cell-cell fusion between infected cells as virus-donor cells and surrounding non-infected target cells is mainly related to virus-encoded fusion proteins, known as viral fusogens displaying high fusogenic properties, and expressed at the cell surface of the virus-donor cells. Virus-induced cell-cell fusion is then mediated by interactions of these viral fusion proteins with surface molecules or receptors involved in virus entry and expressed on neighboring non-infected cells.

COVID-19s emergence and rapid spread is a global public health and economic crisis. However, investigations into the disease, patient-tracking mechanisms, and case report transmissions are both labor-intensive and slow. OBJECTIVE: The pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems, forcing hospitals and medical facilities to find effective ways to share data. This study aims to design a global infectious disease surveillance and case tracking system that can facilitate the detection and control of COVID-19. METHODS: The International Patient Summary (IPS; an electronic health record that contains essential health care information about a patient) was used. The IPS was designed to support the used case scenario for unplanned cross-border care. The design, scope, utility, and potential for reuse of the IPS for unplanned cross-border care make it suitable for situations like COVID-19. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources confirmed that IPS data, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians. To protect privacy, patient data are deidentified. All systems are protected by blockchain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange of records. RESULTS: To achieve worldwide COVID-19 surveillance, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted. The COVID-19 surveillance system was designed based on blockchain architecture. The IPS was used to exchange case study information among physicians. After being verified, physicians can upload IPS files and receive IPS data from other global cases. The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system, with the module based on the Open Application Programming Interface architecture. Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled, and treatment methods can be funded. In the Infectious Disease Case Tracking module, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases. The location information recorded in the blockchain is used to check the locations of different cases. The Case Tracking module was established for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases and prevent disease spread. CONCLUSIONS: We created the IPS of infectious diseases for physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Our system can help health authorities respond quickly to the transmission and spread of unknown diseases, and provides a system for information retrieval on disease transmission. In addition, this system can help researchers form trials and analyze data from different countries. A common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies, useful medications, and clinical intervention outcomes from research in various countries could help control an unknown virus.

Observational studies and subgroup analyses from clinical trials, have suggested a possible benefit from the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance when performing unprotected LMCA PCI. However, the value of imaging with IVUS has never been proven in an appropriately powered randomized clinical trial. The OPtimizaTIon of Left MAin PCI With IntravascuLar Ultrasound (OPTIMAL) trial has been designed to establish whether IVUS-guided PCI optimization on LMCA is associated with superior clinical outcomes when compared with standard qualitative angiography-guided PCI. METHODS: The OPTIMAL trial is a randomized, multicenter, international study designed to enroll a total of 800 patients undergoing PCI for unprotected LMCA disease. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to IVUS-guided PCI versus angiogram-guided PCI. In patients allocated to the angiogram-guided arm, use of IVUS is discouraged, unless there are safety concerns. In patients allocated to the IVUS guidance arm, pre-procedural IVUS assessment is highly recommended, whilst post-procedural IVUS assessment is mandatory to confirm appropriate stenting result and/or to guide stent result optimization, according to predefined criteria. Patients will be followed up to 2 years after the index procedure. The primary outcome measure is the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) patient-oriented composite endpoint (PoCE) which includes all-cause death, any stroke, any myocardial infarction and any repeat revascularization at 2 years follow-up. DISCUSSION: The OPTIMAL trial aims to provide definitive evidence about the clinical impact of IVUS-guidance during PCI to an unprotected LMCA.

If information is negative or confusing, however, this may increase anxiety further. Information gathered under anxiety can thus be beneficial and/or damaging. Here, we examine whether anxiety leads to a general increase in information-seeking, or rather to changes in the type of information and/or situations in which it is sought. In two controlled laboratory studies, we show that both trait anxiety and induced anxiety lead to a selective alteration in information-seeking. In particular, anxiety did not enhance the general tendency to seek information, nor did it alter the valence of the information gathered. Rather, anxiety amplified the tendency to seek information more in response to large changes in the environment. This was true even when the cause of the anxiety was not directly related to the information sought. As anxious individuals have been shown to have problems learning in changing environments, greater information-seeking in such environments may be an adaptive compensatory mechanism.","output":"Anxiety increases information-seeking in response to large changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patient care.Method: A retrospective review of data on 20 CF patients between 1March - 30 November 2020 compared to data from 1 March - 30 November2019. This included: courses of oral antibiotics;days requiring intravenousantibiotics (IVAB);routine IVAB;home IVAB;face-to-face/phone appointments;acute hospital presentations;and microbiology samples.Results: In 2020 the number of courses of oral antibiotics for exacerbationsor bacteria growth decreased from 29 to 14;total IVAB days decreased from177 days to 107. 2 courses of routine IVAB were cancelled and 1 coursewaspostponed, home IVAB decreased from 125 days to 85 due to reducedaseptic IV services.

Simply stated, telehealth is a tool to provide health care from a distance. Jefferson Health has leveraged its acute care telehealth platform to screen, order testing, and manage patients with COVID-19-related concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the expansion and results of using a telehealth program to increase access to care while minimizing additional potential exposures during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Screening algorithms for patients with SARS-CoV-2-related complaints were created, and 150 new clinicians were trained within 72 hours to address increased patient demand. Simultaneously, Jefferson Health created mobile testing sites throughout eastern Pennsylvania and the southern New Jersey region. Visit volume, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests ordered, and the number of positive tests were evaluated, and the volume was compared with preceding time periods. RESULTS: From March 8, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 4663 patients were screened using telehealth, representing a surge in visit volume. There were 1521 patients sent to mobile testing sites, and they received a telephone call from a centralized call center for results. Of the patients who were tested, nearly 20% (n=301) had a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates how using telehealth for a referral to central testing sites can increase access to community-based care, decrease clinician exposure, and minimize the demand for personal protective equipment. The scaling of this innovation may allow health care systems to focus on preparing for and delivering hospital-based care needs.","output":"Solving Community SARS-CoV-2 Testing With Telehealth: Development and Implementation for Screening, Evaluation and Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On February 28, 2020, a case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in a woman resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington.* Epidemiologic investigation of facility A identified 129 cases of COVID-19 associated with facility A, including 81 of the residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died.

Detection capabilities for this category of agents are limited and restricted in their mobility, adaptability and efficiency. The potential for identifying biological agents through a volatile organic compound (VOC) signature presents an opportunity to use detection dogs in a real-time mobile capacity for surveillance and screening strategies. However, the safe handling and access to the materials needed for training detection dogs on restricted or hazardous biological agents prevents its broader application in this field. This study evaluated the use of a polymer-based training aid in a viral detection model using bovine viral diarrhea virus mimicking biosafety level 3+ agent conditions. After the biological agent-based odor was absorbed into the polymer, the aid was rendered safe for handling through a rigorous sterilization process. The viral culture-based training aid was then used to train a cohort of detection dogs (n = 6) to discriminate agent-based target odor in culture from relevant distractor odors including non-target biological agent-based odors. Following culture-based training, dogs were tested for generalization to aids with infected animal sample-based odors across five sample types (fecal, blood, nasal, saliva, and urine). Within the context of the polymer-based training aid system, dogs were successfully trained to detect and discriminate a representative biological viral agent-based odor from distractor odors with a 97.22% (2.78) sensitivity and 97.11% (1.94) specificity. Generalization from the agent-based odor to sample-based odors ranged from 65.40% (8.98) to 91.90 % (6.15) sensitivity and 88.61% (1.46) to 96.00% (0.89) specificity across the sample types.

The exposure was defined as clozapine treatment and the outcome measures (indicating a more severe COVID\\\\19 infection) were: inpatient care, care within intensive care unit or death due to COVID\\\\19 infection. Differences in outcome rates between exposed (n = 966) and unexposed (other antipsychotics; n = 7 267) were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in outcome rates were found between the two groups of patients after adjusting for age, sex and residence in retirement homes.

The curriculum used Project ECHO?, an interactive model of tele-education through Zoom video conferencing, to connect trainees with specialists. Each session had a cancer-specific focus (e.g., breast cancer survivorship) and incorporated a range of core survivorship topics (e.g., surveillance, treatment effects). The session format included a resident case presentation and didactic lecture by an expert discussant. Residents completed pre- and post-curricular surveys to assess for changes in attitude, confidence, practice patterns, and/or knowledge in cancer survivorship care. Of 67 residents, 23/24 FM and 41/43 IM residents participated in the curriculum. Residents attended a mean of 3 sessions. By the end of the curriculum, resident confidence in survivorship topics (surveillance, treatment effects, genetic risk assessment) increased for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers (p < 0.05), and there was a trend toward residents stating they ask patients more often about cancer treatment effects (p = 0.07).

These facets may permit novel methods to emerge to supplement, refine, or replace the routine methods. We have suggested a framework for risk assessment to assure biosafety in vaccines and suggested quantitative modeling to help crystallize thinking about the place of testing, either routine or novel, in this assurance. We assert that testing for adventitious agents should not be the sole basis on which product biosafety is assured. Appropriate sourcing and quality control of raw and starting materials, adherence to principles of Good Manufacturing Practices, including environmental and personnel monitoring and process validation, and finally, testing as verification are the package needed for maximal assurance of biosafety. Thus, a pathway forward to a new paradigm for adventitious agent testing exists in which detection of a broader array of potential adventitious agents might be included in the testing, with adequate sensitivity to provide the needed assurance of verification that there has been no catastrophic breach, in the context of the overall process, design, and adherence to cGMP.

However, the functional role and the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation during insect organ or tissue development are far from being clear. RESULTS: Here, we found that DNA methylation inhibitor (5-aza-dC) treatment in newly molted pupae decreased the chitin content of pupal wing discs and adult wings and resulted in wing deformity of Bombyx mori. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the up-regulation of chitinase 10 (BmCHT10) gene might be related to the decrease of chitin content induced by 5-aza-dC treatment. Further, the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that DNA methylation suppressed the promoter activity of BmCHT10 by down-regulating the transcription factor, homeobox protein araucan (Bmara). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNA pull-down and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bmara directly bound to the BmCHT10 promoter. Therefore, DNA methylation is involved in keeping the structural integrity of the silkworm wings from unwanted chitin degradation, as a consequence, it promotes the wing development of B. mori.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? In a previous randomized controlled trial, barbed polyglyconate suture for vesico-urethral anastomosis was associated with more frequent cystogram leaks, longer mean catheterization times and greater suture costs per case. In the current randomized controlled trial, we show that barbed polyglyconate suture is associated with decreased anastomosis time, decreased need to readjust suture tension, cost reduction, and equal continence and early/late urinary complication rates. OBJECTIVE To examine the effectiveness of barbed polyglyconate suture (V-Loc 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) compared with standard monofilament for posterior reconstruction (PR) and vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 consecutive RARP cases by a single surgeon (K.C.Z.). Standard VUA was performed using three 4-0 poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl; Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) sutures secured with absorbable suture clips (LapraTy, Ethicon; one single 6-inch [15.2 cm] for PR and two attached 6-inch [15.2 cm] for VUA). Barbed suture VUA was performed using two 3-0 6-inch (15.2 cm) barbed polyglyconate sutures. Time to complete the suture set-up by the nursing team, anastomosis time and need to adjust suture tension were recorded. Suture-related complications, validated-questionnaire continence and cost were also examined. RESULTS Compared with a conventional reconstruction technique, there was a significant reduction in mean nurse set-up time (31 vs. 294 s; P < 0.01) and reconstruction time (13.1 vs. 20.8 min; P < 0.01) for the barbed suture technique. Need to readjust suture tension or to place additional suture clips for watertight closure was greater in the standard monofilament group than in the barbed suture group (6% vs. 24%; P= 0.03). ? A cost reduction was recorded at our institution (48.05 vs. 70.25 $CAN) with the barbed suture technique. ? With a mean follow-up of 6.2 months, no delayed anastomotic leak or bladder neck contracture was observed in either group. ?

It has also increased our understanding of the immune system, providing evidence for the preferential selection of BCRs to particular (immunodominant) epitopes post vaccination/infection. These important implications for both drug discovery and immunology mean that it is essential to consider the optimal way to combine experimental and computational technology when probing BCR repertoires for convergence signatures. Here, we discuss the theoretical basis for observing BCR repertoire functional convergence and explore factors of study design that can impact functional signal. We also review the computational arsenal available to detect antibodies with similar functional properties, highlighting opportunities enabled by recent clustering algorithms that exploit structural similarities between BCRs.

METHODS: This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n = 400), severe (n = 727), and mixed (n = 335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23C91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55C91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0C97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6C6.7, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients management during a pandemic surge.

Cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was reportedly associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cognitive function. However, data concerning the association between cerebral rSO2 and dietary intake of CKD patients is limited. METHODS This was a single-center observational study. We recruited 67 CKD patients not undergoing dialysis. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored using the INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Energy intake was evaluated by dietitians based on 3-day meal records. Daily protein and salt intakes were calculated from 24-h urine collection. RESULTS Multivariable regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with energy intake (standardized coefficient: 0.370) and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.236) in Model 1 using parameters with p < 0.10 in simple linear regression analysis (body mass index, Hb level, serum albumin concentration, salt and energy intake) and confounding factors (eGFR, serum sodium concentration, protein intake), and the energy/salt index (standardized coefficient: 0.343) and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.284) in Model 2 using energy/protein index as indicated by energy intake/protein intake and energy/salt index by energy intake/salt intake in place of salt, protein and energy intake. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral rSO2 is affected by energy intake, energy/salt index, serum albumin concentration and Hb level. Sufficient energy intake and adequate salt restriction is important to prevent deterioration of cerebral oxygenation, which might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in addition to the prevention of renal dysfunction in CKD patients.","output":"Effects of dietary intake and nutritional status on cerebral oxygenation in patients with chronic kidney disease not undergoing dialysis: A cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among increasingly common drug shortages, antimicrobial drug and vaccine shortages are the most frequently reported. This could be related to the smaller size of the market, compared to statins or antidepressant drugs. But there are multiple causes to shortages, such as flawed manufacturing processes, modification of quality control processes and scarcity of raw materials. Besides, concentration of manufacturing in emerging economies, dependence on a single producer and pressure on profit margins amplify the consequences of any manufacturing problem. Antimicrobial drug shortages have an impact on patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by leading to choices of alternatives with an inadequately large spectrum, and consequently with deleterious side effects and increased costs. Moreover, vaccine shortages result in controversies exacerbated by the antivax community. Given the transmissibility of infectious diseases, antimicrobial drug and vaccine shortages will impact both individual and population health through herd effect. For these reasons, they represent a worldwide threat that goes beyond impact at the individual level. There has been no coordinated response to this threat hitherto. In order to provide an adequate response plan, precise data on shortage occurrences and their causes are a prerequisite. Moreover, efficient action will not be possible without a transnational will. Examples of useful actions could be: Incorporating a standardized survey into the WHO surveillance programs on antimicrobial use; creating a communication channel between pharmaceutical companies, providers and national agencies so as to recognize upcoming shortages; licensing some laboratories to manufacture out-of-stock drugs, for the duration of the shortage.","output":"Shortages Without Frontiers: Antimicrobial Drug and Vaccine Shortages Impact Far Beyond the Individual!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phage therapy has emerged as a potential novel treatment of sepsis for which no decisive progress has been achieved thus far Obviously, phages can help eradicate local bacterial infection and bacteremia that may occur in a syndrome For example, phages may be helpful in correcting excessive inflammatory responses and aberrant immunity that occur in sepsis Data from animal studies strongly suggest that phages may indeed be an efficient means of therapy for experimentally induced sepsis In recent years, a number of reports have appeared describing the successful treatment of patients with sepsis Moreover, novel data on the anti-viral potential of phages may be interpreted as suggesting that phages could be used as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 Thus, clinical trials assessing the value of phage therapy in sepsis, including viral sepsis, are urgently needed","output":"Sepsis, Phages, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pesar de que el SARS-COV-2 afecta principalmente a nivel respiratorio, se esta evidenciando cada vez en mayor medida afectacin sobre otros sistemas.

In this study we assessed T-cell responses directed against highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2. Epitope mapping revealed 16 CD8+ T-cell epitopes across the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S) and ORF3a proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and five CD8+ T-cell epitopes encoded within the highly conserved regions of the ORF1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative sequence analysis showed high conservation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab T-cell epitopes in seasonal coronaviruses. Paradoxically, the immune responses directed against the conserved ORF1ab epitopes were infrequent and subdominant in both convalescent and unexposed participants. This subdominant immune response was consistent with a low abundance of ORF1ab encoded proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Overall, these observations suggest that while cross-reactive CD8+ T cells likely exist in unexposed individuals, they are not common and therefore are unlikely to play a significant role in providing broad pre-existing immunity in the community.","output":"Low antigen abundance limits efficient T-cell recognition of highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient antiviral drug discovery has been a pressing issue of global public health concern since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019.

First, 25HC reduces lipid rafts and cholesterol in the cytomembrane by inhibiting sterol-regulatory element binding proteins-2, stimulating liver X receptor, and activating Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyl-transferase. Second, 25HC impairs endosomal pathways by restricting the function of oxysterol-binding protein or Niemann-pick protein C1, causing the virus to fail to release nucleic acid. Third, 25HC disturbs the prenylation of viral proteins by suppressing the sterol-regulatory element binding protein pathway and glycosylation by increasing the sensitivity of glycans to endoglycosidase.

Methods: The eligible participants (M age = 57.06, SD = 11.26 years) were enrolled in the MHP, a therapist-supported mobile intervention. Using a non-randomized pre-post design, change in mental health QoL [WHO QoL Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) psychological health] and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) from baseline to post-treatment were examined. Time of enrollment [pre- vs. post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was included as a between-subjects factor in the repeated measures analyses. Results: Forty-two participants enrolled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; eight enrolled after the pandemic began. Among the pre-COVID-19 enrollees, increase in mental health QoL, F((1, 38)) = 12.61, p = 0.001, (2) = 0.25 and decreases in loneliness emerged, F((1, 38)) = 5.42, p = 0.025, (2) = 0.13.

Parkin can function as a neuroprotector that plays a crucial role in the regulation of mitophagy, and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with Parkinsons disease (PD). Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that Parkin can also function as a tumor suppressor and that somatic and germline mutations in PARK2 are associated with various human cancers, including lung cancer. However, it is presently unknown how the tumor suppressor activity of Parkin is affected by these mutations and whether it is associated with mitophagy. Herein, we show that wild-type (WT) Parkin can rapidly translocate onto mitochondria following mitochondrial damage and that Parkin promotes mitophagic clearance of mitochondria in lung cancer cells. However, lung cancer-linked mutations inhibit the mitochondrial translocation and ubiquitin-associated activity of Parkin. Among all lung cancer-linked mutants that we tested, A46T Parkin failed to translocate onto mitochondria and could not recruit downstream mitophagic regulators, including optineurin (OPTN) and TFEB, whereas N254S and R275W Parkin displayed slower mitochondrial translocation than WT Parkin. Moreover, we found that deferiprone (DFP), an iron chelator that can induce mitophagy, greatly increased the death of A46T Parkin-expressing lung cancer cells. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mitophagic mechanism in lung cancer, suggesting that lung cancer-linked mutations in PARK2 are associated with impaired mitophagy and identifying DFP as a novel therapeutic agent for PARK2-linked lung cancer and possibly other types of cancers driven by mitophagic dysregulation.","output":"Somatic and germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PARK2 impair PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in lung cancer cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune modulation, being one of the potential strategies to combat COVID\\\\19 infection, emphasis has been laid on enhancing the innate immune response in a balanced manner.

The major determinants of irisin were assessed by multivariate linear regression (MLR) analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to minimize the bias that can result from BMI. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to obtain the optimal threshold value of irisin. RESULTS: The girls with CPP and PT had higher irisin levels than controls (P < 0.05).

We also did a case-control study of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were admitted to the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia during the study period. Cases were matched by age, sex, and month of hospital admission to at least two controls admitted to the same hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period. Findings: Between Feb 24 and May 1, 2020, we collected data from 1525 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: 117 (8%) presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 65 patients had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas 52 presented with a spectrum of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 but were not swab tested. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than those with suspected COVID-19 (median age 68 [IQR 55-76] years vs 57 [49-67] years; p=00010) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (33 [51%] vs 14 [27%] patients; odds ratio [OR] 28 [95% CI 13-61]; p=0031) and obesity (11 [17%] vs 1 [2%]; OR 110 [13-834]; p=00059). We found no differences in rheumatological disease or background therapy between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. 47 (72%) of the 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. 12 (10%) deaths occurred among the 117 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ten in those with confirmed COVID-19 and two in those with suspected COVID-19). Deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than survivors (median age 788 years [IQR 753-813] vs 655 years [533-740]; p=00002). We observed no differences in sex, comorbidities, or therapies between the deceased patients and survivors. The case-control study comprised 26 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and COVID-19 pneumonia and 62 matched controls. We found no significant differences between cases and controls in duration of COVID-19 symptoms before admission, duration of stay in hospital, or the local chest X-ray scoring system. Glucocorticoids were used for severe respiratory manifestations related to lung involvement in 17 (65%) of 26 cases and tocilizumab in six (23%) of 26; thrombotic events occurred in four (15%) of 26 cases. Four (15%) of 26 cases and six (10%) of 62 controls died during the study period.

In settings of ARDS, the loss of barrier integrity is mediated by cellCcell contact disassembly and actin remodelling. Studies into molecular mechanisms responsible for improving microvascular barrier function are therefore vital in the development of therapeutic targets for reducing vascular permeability seen in ARDS. Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors found in several extraoral systems, including lung epithelial and smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we show for the first time that several T2Rs are expressed in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs). Our results focus on those which are highly expressed as: T2R10, T2R14 and T2R38. Agonists for T2R10 (denatonium) and T2R38 (phenylthiourea), but not T2R14 (noscapine), significantly attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced permeability and VE-cadherin internalisation in HPAECs. In T2R10- or T2R38-siRNA knockdown cells, these endothelial-protective effects were abolished, indicating a direct effect of agonists in regulating barrier integrity. Our further findings indicate that T2R10 and T2R38 exert their barrier-protective function through cAMP but via Rac1-dependent and independent pathways, respectively. However, using an in vivo model of ARDS, the T2R38 agonist, phenylthiourea, was not able to protect against pulmonary edema formation. Taken together, these studies identify bitter taste sensing in the pulmonary endothelium to regulate barrier integrity in vitro through cAMP-Rac1 signalling.","output":"Agonists for Bitter Taste Receptors T2R10 and T2R38 Attenuate LPS-Induced Permeability of the Pulmonary Endothelium in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules which are submitted to a process denominated SELEX. SELEX uses reiterative screening of a random oligonucleotide library to identify high-affinity binders to a chosen target, which may be a peptide, protein, or entire cells or viral particles. Aptamers can rival antibodies in target recognition, and benefit from their non-proteic nature, ease of modification, increased stability, and pharmacokinetic properties. This turns them into ideal candidates for diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications. Here, we review the recent accomplishments in the development of aptamers targeting emerging viral diseases, with emphasis on recent findings of aptamers binding to coronaviruses. We focus on aptamer development for diagnosis, including biosensors, in addition to aptamer modifications for stabilization in body fluids and tissue penetration. Such aptamers are aimed at in vivo diagnosis and treatment, such as quantification of viral load and blocking host cell invasion, virus assembly, or replication, respectively. Although there are currently no in vivo applications of aptamers in combating viral diseases, such strategies are promising for therapy development in the future.","output":"Aptamer Applications in Emerging Viral Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging and obesity-related conditions seem to worsen the effect of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) This study assessed the possible roles of metabolic/obesity phenotypes and vitamin D status in increasing the greater severity of COVID-19 We studied 353,299 UK Biobank participants from England with a mean age of 67 7 years Metabolic/obesity phenotypes were defined as a combination of metabolic components (hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) and obesity Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether the addition of metabolic disorders and vitamin D insufficiency increased obesity associations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) represented 12 3% of the total analytic samples, and 21 5%, 18 5%, and 19 8% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively Vitamin D insufficiency phenotypes represented 53 5% of the total analytic samples, and 59 5%, 61 7%, and 61 5% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively In multivariate logistic regression, MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency and their combination were significantly associated with COVID-19 illness severity (odds ratio [OR] for COVID-19 hospitalization = 2 33, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2 02-2 70;OR for confirmed COVID-19 = 2 06, 95% CI, 1 58-2 70;OR for severe COVID-19 = 2 06, 95% CI, 1 47-2 87) Elderly men were prone to have a higher risk of COVID-19 than women Our findings showed that MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency are associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 severity, especially for adults 65 years and older Susceptible individuals should be aware of their conditions and avoid contact with new coronavirus","output":"Metabolic Healthy Obesity, Vitamin D Status, and Risk of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The whole world is facing an ongoing global health emergency of COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, the optimal choices for both the type of initial fracture stabilisation (external fixation/EF, early total care/ETC, conservative treatment/TC) and the best time point for conversion from temporary to definitive fixation are challenging factors. PATIENTS: Patients aged  16 years with moderate and severe trauma documented in the TraumaRegister DGU(?) between 2002 and 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Demographics, ISS, surgical treatment strategy (ETC vs. EF vs. TC), time for conversion to definitive care, complication (MOF, sepsis) and survival rates were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 13,091 trauma patients were included. EF patients more often sustained high-energy trauma (car: 43.1 vs. 29.5%, p < 0.001), were younger (40.6 vs. 48.1 years, p < 0.001), were more severely injured (ISS 25.4 vs. 19.1 pts., p < 0.001), and had higher sepsis (11.8 vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) and MOF rates (33.1 vs. 16.0%, p < 0.001) compared to ETC patients. A shift from ETC to EF was observed. The time until conversion decreased for femoral fractures from 9 to 8 days within the observation period.

We further investigated specific predictors of parental distress, including burnout, anger aimed at children, worry, lack of social support, lower perceived self-efficacy, and difficulty to work from home. Method: In this cross-sectional, epidemiological study, we disseminate an online survey that was administered two weeks after the government-initiated physical distancing protocols were established. Data were collected from March 31 to April 7. Results: Female parents compared to male parents and parents living with more than one child per parent or child(ren) with special needs compared to those living with one or fewer children per parent reported higher levels of parental stress. Burnout and social support were further associated with parental stress. Specifically, nearly one-fourth of the parents reported that they have felt burned out or in the proximity of feeling burned out more than half the days during the social distancing interventions. Also, 29% of the parents reported that they were angrier at their child(ren) than usual during the physical distancing period.Parents with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis had significantly higher parental stress compared to individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms above standardized cutoff levels among the 2868 parents was 25.4% for depression and 24.1% for anxiety, with the highest prevalence score on both symptoms of anxiety (37.6%) and depression (38.5%) for the youngest parents (age group 21C30 years). Furthermore, the parents who were home with their children and predominantly followed distancing protocol by socially distancing from public activity and peers (i.e., at least 10 out of 14 days) had significantly higher symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (27%), compared to parents who did not isolate in the same manner (i.e., depression 13% and anxiety 15%). Conclusions: The present study reveals that home confinement during the restricted lockdown period is related to markedly high levels of parental stress, in addition to symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents. Given the detrimental effects of depression, anxiety, and parental stress on the quality of life, morbidity rates, as well as adverse child outcomes and the potential risk of child abuse and neglect, these results suggest that appropriate action should be taken to impede further development of these symptoms, as well as developing interventions aimed at vulnerable subgroups and other relevant factors associated with increased parental stress.

Various variants were developed, tested and then rejected and then finally reach the material and variant composition. The use of disposable medical devices in healthcare is now a common practice, but also an environmental problem on a global scale. Despite the widespread adoption of this best practice, many healthcare facilities and patients still register resistance and scepticism against this form, actually also in connection with protection against COVID-19.

Methods: In an acute care hospital (ACH) and a long-term care facility (LTCF), 417 surfaces were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and adenosine triphosphate before and after various cleaning strategies, including ultraviolet light (UV-C), electrostatic spraying, and room fogging. Results: ACH surface contamination differed among outbreak and non-outbreak wards (p = 0.001). RNA was detected on 66% of surfaces before cleaning and on 23% of those surfaces immediately after terminal cleaning, for a 65% post-cleaning reduction (p = 0.001). UV-C resulted in an 87% reduction (p = 0.023), while spraying with electrostatic bleach resulted in a 47% reduction (p = 0.010). LTCF contamination rates differed between the dementia, rehabilitation, and the residential units (p = 0.005). 67% of surfaces had RNA after room fogging without terminal-style wiping. Fogging with wiping led to an 11% reduction in the proportion of positive surfaces. Discussion: Baseline contamination varied by type of unit and outbreak conditions, but not facility type. Removal of viral RNA varied according to strategy.

We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time), and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this LLN, the infectivity process and the susceptible process are determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then derive the exposed, infectious and recovered processes, again using integral equations. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non--Markovian) branching process, and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of non-extinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use these equations to derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ during the early stage of an epidemic, in terms of the average individual infectivity function and the exponential rate of growth of the epidemic.","output":"Epidemic models with varying infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores how much the Vietnamese public trust their government during the COVID-19 pandemic and how public trust in government translates into support and compliance with governments policy and regulation.

The recognition of the key role for increased inflammation in COVID-19 has led to a proliferation of clinical trials targeting inflammation. The purpose of this review is to characterize the current state of immunotherapy trials in COVID-19, and focuses on associated cardiotoxicities, given the importance of pharmacovigilance. The search terms related to COVID-19 were queried in ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 1621 trials were identified and screened for interventional trials directed at inflammation. Trials (n = 226) were fully assessed for the use of a repurposed drug, identifying a total of 141 therapeutic trials using a repurposed drug to target inflammation in COVID-19 infection. Building on the results of the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial demonstrating the benefit of low dose dexamethasone in COVID-19, repurposed drugs targeting inflammation are promising. Repurposed drugs directed at inflammation in COVID-19 primarily have been drawn from cancer therapies and immunomodulatory therapies, specifically targeted anti-inflammatory, anti-complement, and anti-rejection agents. The proposed mechanisms for many cytokine-directed and anti-rejection drugs are focused on evidence of efficacy in cytokine release syndromes in humans or animal models. Anti-complement-based therapies have the potential to decrease both inflammation and microvascular thrombosis. Cancer therapies are hypothesized to decrease vascular permeability and inflammation. Few publications to date describe using these drugs in COVID-19. Early COVID-19 intervention trials have re-emphasized the subtle, but important cardiotoxic sequelae of potential therapies on outcomes. The volume of trials targeting the COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory phase continues to grow rapidly with the evaluation of repurposed drugs and late-stage investigational agents. Leveraging known clinical safety profiles and pharmacodynamics allows swift investigation in clinical trials for a novel indication.

ECMO patients that develop acute brain injuries (ABIs) are observed to have worse outcomes. We evaluated the association between rScO2 and ABI in venoarterial (VA) ECMO patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively-collected NIRS data from patients undergoing VA ECMO from April 2016 to October 2016. Baseline demographics, ECMO and clinical characteristics, cerebral oximetry data, neuroradiographic images, and functional outcomes were reviewed for each patient. rScO2 desaturations were defined as a >25% decline from baseline or an absolute value < 40% and quantified by frequency, duration, and area under the curve per hour of NIRS monitoring (AUC rate, rScO2*min/h). The primary outcome was ABI, defined as abnormalities noted on brain computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained during or after ECMO therapy. Results: Eighteen of Twenty patients who underwent NIRS monitoring while on VA ECMO were included in analysis. Eleven patients (61%) experienced rScO2 desaturations. Patients with desaturations were more frequently female (73 vs. 14%, p = 0.05), had acute liver dysfunction (64 vs. 14%, p = 0.05), and higher peak total bilirubin (5.2 mg/dL vs. 1.4 mg/dL, p = 0.02). Six (33%) patients exhibited ABI, and had lower pre-ECMO Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (5 vs. 10, p = 0.03) and higher peak total bilirubin levels (7.3 vs. 1.4, p = 0.009). All ABI patients experienced rScO2 desaturation while 42% of patients without ABI experienced desaturation (p = 0.04). ABI patients had higher AUC rates than non-ABI patients (right hemisphere: 5.7 vs. 0, p = 0.01, left hemisphere: 119 vs. 0, p = 0.06), more desaturation events (13 vs. 0, p = 0.05), longer desaturation duration (2:33 vs. 0, p = 0.002), and more severe desaturation events with rScO2 < 40 (9 vs. 0, p = 0.05). Patients with ABI had lower GCS scores (post-ECMO initiation) before care withdrawal or discharge than those without ABI (10 vs. 15, p = 0.02).

Within this context of uncertainty (?viral modernity?), flexible education is an option to promote a more just, equitable, accessible and creative educational system. In order to properly interpret the effects of this unique educational circumstance, it is essential to study the previous situation in terms of the use of digital technologies in teaching practices. The objective of the study is to describe the educational integration of ICT and the teacher education model to obtain evidence that contributes to understanding the phenomenon. To this end, a questionnaire consisting of two self-reporting tools and a scale on the description of teaching practice with ICT was applied. The sample is made up of teachers from public primary and secondary schools (N = 251). Data collection was carried out in the months prior to the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A univariate analysis of the variables and contrast tests of non-parametric hypotheses was carried out, along with calculation of the reliability and construction validity of the measuring instruments. The results reveal the most frequent types of teaching practice with ICT and the spaces where digital technologies are commonly used.

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","output":"The immediate impact of lockdown measures on mental health and couples' relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic - results of a representative population survey in Germany."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide resulting in the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity Together, our transcriptomic studies have delineated disease pathways to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to facilitate the design of new therapeutics for COVID-19","output":"IFN signaling and neutrophil degranulation transcriptional signatures are induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to alter cortical excitability of the lower extremity (LE) and to influence performance on LE tasks like ankle tracking accuracy; but no study, to our knowledge, ever reported a significant change in cortical excitability relative to sham-tDCS. Additionally, because several different electrode montages were used in previous studies, it is difficult to know how stimulation should be applied to achieve this effect. Our objective was to determine whether active-tDCS alters cortical excitability of the LE and ankle tracking accuracy relative to sham-tDCS in healthy participants. The efficacy of two electrode montages and two conductance mediums were compared. Methods A triple-blind, fully randomized, within-subjects study was conducted with healthy participants (N=18, 24.2 (6.6) years). Cortical recruitment curves and measures of ankle tracking accuracy for the dominant lower extremity were obtained before and after participants received active-tDCS at 2 milliamps for 20 minutes using montage-medium combinations of M1-SO:Saline, M1-SO:Gel, C1-C2:Saline, and C1-C2:Gel and a sham-tDCS condition (M1-SO: Saline). Results The motor evoked potential maximum of the recruitment curve was significantly lower for active than sham-tDCS, but only for the M1-SO:Saline combination. No other significant differences in the recruitment curve parameters or in ankle tracking were found.

If part or all if the HVAD 10 mm-diameter outflow graft is retained during replacement, the HeartMate 3 will have to run at a higher speed than it would with its 14 mm-diameter graft. METHODS: A steady-state, in vitro study was run with 250 mm-long samples of HVAD, HeartMate 3, and half-HVAD/half-HeartMate 3 grafts and, additionally, 125 and 375 mm-long samples of HVAD graft. Flows of 3.0, 3.9, 4.3, 4.7, and 6.0 L/min were applied to encompass expected clinical conditions. RESULTS: At typical and high flow rates of 4.3 and 6.0 L/min, HeartMate 3 rotor speeds with the full HVAD graft had to be increased relative to those with the HeartMate 3 graft from 5350 to 5700 and 6350 to 6900 rpm, respectively, with power consumption increases from 3.7 to 4.3 (16%) and 5.5 to 6.8 W (24%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study did not elucidate a severe consequence of utilizing remnant HVAD graft during pump exchange, but the incremental risks of a higher rotor speed, disadvantage to the patient in battery runtime, and the general benefit of complete conversion to the HeartMate 3 graft should be balanced against other procedural considerations.

Gradually, there have been an increased number of COVID-19-associated intrinsic kidney pathologies in children and adolescents reported as well. The pathophysiological mechanisms between COVID-19 and the onset of kidney pathology are not fully known in children; it remains a challenge to distinguish between intrinsic kidney pathologies that were caused directly by COVID-19 viral invasion, and cases which occurred as a result of multisystem inflammatory syndrome due to the infection. This challenge is made more difficult in children, due to the ethical limitations of performing kidney biopsies to reach a biopsy-proven diagnosis. Although previous systematic reviews have summarized the various pathological kidney manifestations that have occurred in adults following acute COVID-19 infection, such reviews have not yet been published for children and adolescents. We describe the results of a systematic review for intrinsic kidney pathology following COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents. Methods: A systematic literature search of published data up until 31 October was completed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Research articles reporting new-onset or relapsed intrinsic kidney pathology in children or adolescents (18 years) following acute COVID-19 infection were included for qualitative review. COVID-19 infection status was defined by a positive result from a RT-PCR, or nuclear antibody testing. Only full-text articles published in the English language were selected for review. Results: Twenty-nine cases from fifteen articles were included in the qualitative synthesis of this systematic review. Nephrotic syndrome, as an umbrella condition, appeared as the most frequently observed presentation (20 cases) with disease remission noted in all cases with steroid treatment. Other cases included numerous glomerulonephritides, such as acute necrotizing glomerulonephritis, MPO vasculitis and collapsing glomerulopathy, and thrombotic microangiopathies, such as aHUS. For patients with transplanted kidneys, T-cell-mediated rejection and mild tubular interstitial infiltration were noted following testing positive for COVID-19. There were no mortalities reported in any of the included cases, although two patients remained dialysis dependent at hospital discharge. Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the various intrinsic pathological kidney manifestations in children and adolescents as a result of acute COVID-19 infection. The clinical timeline and presentation of these cases support the mechanistic hypothesis between COVID-19 infection and the onset of intrinsic kidney pathologies within this context. The progressive introduction of vaccination programs for children and adolescents may hopefully reduce the severity of COVID-19-associated illnesses, and pathological kidney manifestations in this population.","output":"Intrinsic Kidney Pathology Following COVID-19 Infection in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To reflect on the role of Brazilian nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering as a historical landmark the bicentenary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, a precursor of modern nursing, celebrated in 2020.

A critical challenge is to ensure that patients adhere to the full course of treatment to prevent the continued spread of the disease and development of drug-resistant disease. Mobile health interventions hold promise to provide the required adherence support to improve TB treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB treatment support tools (TB-TSTs) intervention on treatment outcomes (success and default) and to assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to TB-TSTs implementation. METHODS: The TB-TSTs study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups in which 400 adult patients newly diagnosed with TB will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus TB-TSTs. Participants will be recruited on a rolling basis from 4 clinical sites in Argentina. The intervention consists of a smartphone progressive web app, a treatment supporter (eg, TB nurse, physician, or social worker), and a direct adherence test strip engineered for home use. Intervention group participants will report treatment progress and interact with a treatment supporter using the app and metabolite urine test strip. The primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use, and usability. We will assess patients' and providers' perceptions of barriers to implementation and synthesize lessons learned. We hypothesize that the TB-TSTs intervention will be more effective because it allows patients and TB supporters to monitor and address issues in real time and provide tailored support. We will share the results with stakeholders and policy makers. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2020, with a delayed start due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and complete enrollment is expected by approximately July 2022. Data collection and follow-up are expected to be completed 6 months after the last patient is enrolled. Results from the analyses based on the primary end points are expected to be submitted for publication within a year of data collection completion. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be the first study to evaluate a patient-centered remote treatment support strategy using a mobile tool and a home-based direct drug metabolite test. The results will provide robust scientific evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and adoption of mobile health tools. The findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but also more generally for chronic disease management and will improve our understanding of how to support patients facing challenging treatment regimens.

This fusion core contains a parallel trimeric coiled-coil of three HR1 helices, around which three HR2 helices are entwined in an antiparallel manner. Various hydrophobic and charged interactions form between HR1 and HR2 domains to stabilize the overall conformation of GP2 fusion core. Based on the structure, we designed several peptides spanning the HR2 domain and tested their antiviral activities. We found that the longer HR2 peptides were effective in inhibiting LASV GPC protein-mediated cellCcell fusion under low pH condition.

Main outcome measures: Confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, and adherence to protective behaviours. Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes/no). Results: Compared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% [10.6-11.9%], OR 1.11 [1.03-1.20]) and ex-smokers (10.9% [10.4-11.5%], OR 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) than never smokers (10.2% [9.9-10.6%]), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR 1.21 [1.13-1.29]). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about catching (current: OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; ex-smokers: OR 1.15 [1.09-1.22]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR 1.34 [1.27-1.43]; ex-smokers: OR 1.22 [1.16-1.28]).

Activation of PRRs triggers a series of signaling cascades, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobials, thereby contributing to the early host defense against microbes and regulating adaptive immunity. Additionally, PRRs can detect perturbation of cellular homeostasis caused by pathogens and fine-tune the immune responses. Among PRRs, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) have attracted particular interest in the context of cellular stress-induced inflammation during infection.

Reliable estimates of mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential for understanding clinical prognosis, planning healthcare capacity, and epidemic forecasting. The case-fatality ratio (CFR), calculated from total numbers of reported cases and reported deaths, is the most commonly reported metric, but it can be a misleading measure of overall mortality. The objectives of this study were to (1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data and (2) infer estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for biases and examine the CFR, the symptomatic case-fatality ratio (sCFR), and the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) in different geographic locations. METHOD AND FINDINGS: We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases: preferential ascertainment of severe cases and right-censoring of mortality. We fitted the transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei Province, China, and applied the same model to six regions in Europe: Austria, Bavaria (Germany), Baden-Wrttemberg (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), Spain, and Switzerland. In Hubei, the baseline estimates were as follows: CFR 2.4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.1%-2.8%), sCFR 3.7% (3.2%-4.2%), and IFR 2.9% (2.4%-3.5%). Estimated measures of mortality changed over time. Across the six locations in Europe, estimates of CFR varied widely. Estimates of sCFR and IFR, adjusted for bias, were more similar to each other but still showed some degree of heterogeneity. Estimates of IFR ranged from 0.5% (95% CrI 0.4%-0.6%) in Switzerland to 1.4% (1.1%-1.6%) in Lombardy, Italy. In all locations, mortality increased with age. Among individuals 80 years or older, estimates of the IFR suggest that the proportion of all those infected with SARS-CoV-2 who will die ranges from 20% (95% CrI 16%-26%) in Switzerland to 34% (95% CrI 28%-40%) in Spain. A limitation of the model is that count data by date of onset are required, and these are not available in all countries. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of SARS-Cov-2 mortality from surveillance data during outbreaks. The CFR is not a good predictor of overall mortality from SARS-CoV-2 and should not be used for evaluation of policy or comparison across settings. Geographic differences in IFR suggest that a single IFR should not be applied to all settings to estimate the total size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in different countries. The sCFR and IFR, adjusted for right-censoring and preferential ascertainment of severe cases, are measures that can be used to improve and monitor clinical and public health strategies to reduce the deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 mortality during the early stages of an epidemic: A modeling study in Hubei, China, and six regions in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To control epidemics, sites more affected by mortality should be identified. METHODS: Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed. RESULTS: Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity - network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes, while the data from rank I-III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I-III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The geo-temporal progression of epidemics seems to be highly structured. Epidemic network properties can distinguish regions that differ in mortality. This real-time geo-referenced analysis can inform both decision-makers and clinicians.","output":"Early network properties of the COVID-19 pandemic - The Chinese scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge of research activity to find methods/drugs to treat it. There has been drug-repurposing research focusing on traditional medicines. Concomitantly, many researchers tried to find in silico evidence for traditional medicines. There is a great increase in article publication to commensurate the new-found research interests. This situation inspired the authors to have a comprehensive understanding of the multitude of publications related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a wish to get promising drug leads. MAIN BODY: This review article has been conceived and made as a hybrid of the review of the selected papers advertised recently and produced in the interest of the COVID-19 situation, and in silico work done by the authors. The outcome of the present review underscores a recommendation for thorough MDS analyses of the promising drug leads. The inclusion of in silico work as an addition to the review was motivated by a recently published article of Toelzer and colleagues. The in silico investigation of free fatty acids is novel to the field and it buttresses the further MDS analysis of drug leads for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The review performed threw light on the need for MDS analyses to be considered together with the application of other in silico methods of prediction of pharmacologic properties directing towards the sites of drug-receptor regulation. Also, the present analysis would help formulate new recipes for complementary medicines.","output":"Potent phytochemicals against COVID-19 infection from phyto-materials used as antivirals in complementary medicines: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Aminopeptidases are a group of enzymes found on the cell surface and in the cytoplasmic compartments of many peripheral blood cell types and their progenitors. Their functional roles include the hydrolysis of several biologically active peptides and growth factors and some have proved to be of diagnostic and prognostic value in leukaemia. These enzymes may also be found in serum as a consequence of non-haematopoietic related diseases and so have been used as indicators of liver damage. Haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow go through a process of growth and differentiation before being released into the peripheral circulation where they fulfill many functional roles. The enzyme activities of some aminopeptidases have been shown to modulate the growth of these cells. In addition, the activities of these enzymes themselves can be regulated by haematopoietic growth factors. However, the mechanisms that regulate their expression and activity are not fully understood. In this report the current literature has been reviewed for evidence of expression, regulation and clinical significance.","output":"The significance of aminopeptidases and haematopoietic cell differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An interview with 2021 TMS President Ellen Cerreta is presented.

METHODS The extent of PAS involvement in the eyes of patients with angle closure was assessed by indentation gonioscopy, and the part of non-PAS and PAS were assigned into two groups (NPAS and PAS). Anterior chamber angles were then imaged by AS-OCT with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation directly into the pupils, leading to pupillary constriction and increasing anterior chamber angle width. Parameters including the angle opening distance at 750 m anterior to the scleral spur (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area at 750 m anterior to the scleral spur (TISA750) were then obtained. The differences before and after LED irradiation of AOD750 and TISA750 were calculated and used to generate a PAS model based on binary logistic regression. Validation data were then tested. RESULTS A total of 258 AS-OCT images in 14 eyes were assigned to the modeling data, and 120 were assigned to the validation data. There were no differences in AOD750 and TISA750 in the dark between NPAS and PAS (PAOD750 = 0.258, PTISA750 = 0.486), whereas after LED light exposure, TISA750light was larger in NPAS than in PAS (P = 0.047). The light-dark differences of both parameters showed significant differences between the two groups (PAOD750dif = 0.019, PTISA750dif < 0.001). The area under the curve of the model performance was 0.841, and the overall correct rate was 80.8% based on the validation data.

While B2R is constitutively expressed and regulates a plethora of physiological processes, B1R is almost undetectable under physiological conditions and contributes to pathological inflammation. Several KKS components (kininogens, tissue and plasma kallikreins, and kinin receptors) are overexpressed in human and animal models of retinal diseases, and their inhibition, particularly B1R, reduces inflammation and pathological neovascularization. In this review, we provide an overview of the KKS with emphasis on kinin receptors in the healthy retina and their detrimental roles in DR and AMD. We highlight the crosstalk between the KKS and the reninCangiotensin system (RAS), which is known to be detrimental in ocular pathologies.

Organisational objectives can be efficiently achieved when employees are willing to do work that is beyond their job description. Organisations with employees with high organisational citizenship behaviour have a competitive advantage and are highly productive Research purpose: The study investigated the influence of compensation and training and development on organisational citizenship behaviour amongst academic staff at a rural-based South African institution of higher learning. Motivation for the study: Research on the influence of compensation and training and development on organisational citizenship behaviour is not new. However, the studies were carried out in different sectors outside South Africa. There is still scant information known about citizenship behaviour in the higher education sector in general and in South African rural-based institutions of higher learning in particular. Research approach/design and method: The study was based on a quantitative approach, which used a cross-sectional research design. A sample of 152 academic staff participated in this study. Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression analysis technique were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Main findings: The findings revealed a significant relationship between compensation and organisational citizenship behaviour. A significant correlation was also found between training and development and organisational citizenship behaviour. However, in multiple regression analysis, compensation was found to be the only predictor of organisational citizenship behaviour. Moreover, no significant difference in levels of organisational citizenship behaviour between men and women was found. Practical/managerial implications: The management of the institution should continuously review its compensation or rewards policies to enhance organisational citizenship behaviour amongst the academic staff. Institutions of higher learning should also compensate their employees and develop them fairly regardless of gender in order to promote organisational citizenship behaviour.

Reducing unnecessary antibiotic usage in this population is important to prevent adverse effects and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients admitted to our health system between March and May 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR. We reviewed patients with positive cultures from urine, blood, sputum, and sterile sites. Positive cultures were reviewed to determine if they represented a true infection versus a contaminant or colonization. Patients with true infections were categorized as having a co-infection (CI) if the positive culture was collected within 48 hours of initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Additional data was collected on patient demographics, types of infections, organisms grown, and antibiotic usage. RESULTS: 902 patients were admitted with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests during the study period. Of these, 47 patients (5.2%) had a bacterial CI. Some patients had more than one CI, with 53 total CIs identified. The median age of patients with CI was 66 years old (39 C 90). Tables 1 and 2 describe patient characteristics and infections. A subgroup analysis on types of bacteria was done on the 20 patients with a respiratory CI, who accounted for 2.2% of all COVID-positive patients admitted during the study period. In these infections, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common organisms, accounting for 60%, 15%, and 10% infections, respectively. Table 1.

To illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each donor source, we performed a nationwide retrospective study of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) of patients with allo-HSCT-treated ATL. One-year GRFS did not significantly differ between patients who received related bone marrow transplantation (R-BMT; 26%, n = 117), related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (R-PBSCT; 22%, n = 225), unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT; 26%, n = 619), and cord blood transplantation (CBT; 21%, n = 359; p = 0.09).

However, little is known about pediatricians' experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative survey of American Academy of Pediatrics postresidency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n = 744; response rate = 48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which nonusers would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among nonusers, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth.

However, the condition of some of these patients becomes severe or critical as the disease progresses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a telemedicine model that was developed to address the challenges of treating patients with progressive COVID-19 who are home-quarantined and shortages in the medical workforce. METHODS: A telemedicine system was developed to continuously monitor the progression of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19. The system was built based on a popular social media smartphone app called WeChat; the app was used to establish two-way communication between a multidisciplinary team consisting of 7 medical workers and 188 home-quarantined individuals (including 74 confirmed patients with COVID-19). The system helped patients self-assess their conditions and update the multidisciplinary team through a telemedicine form stored on a cloud service, based on which the multidisciplinary team made treatment decisions. We evaluated this telemedicine system via a single-center retrospective study conducted at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, in January 2020. RESULTS: Among 188 individuals using the telemedicine system, 114 (60.6%) were not infected with COVID-19 and were dismissed. Of the 74 confirmed patients with COVID-19, 26 (35%) recovered during the study period and voluntarily stopped using the system. The remaining 48/76 confirmed patients with COVID-19 (63%) used the system until the end of the study, including 6 patients whose conditions progressed to severe or critical. These 6 patients were admitted to hospital and were stabilized (one received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for 17 days). All 74 patients with COVID-19 eventually recovered. Through a comparison of the monitored symptoms between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients, we found prolonged persistence and deterioration of fever, dyspnea, lack of strength, and muscle soreness to be diagnostic of need for hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: By continuously monitoring the changes in several key symptoms, the telemedicine system reduces the risks of delayed hospitalization due to disease progression for patients with COVID-19 quarantined at home. The system uses a set of scales for quarantine management assessment that enables patients to self-assess their conditions. The results are useful for medical staff to identify disease progression and, hence, make appropriate and timely treatment decisions. The system requires few staff to manage a large cohort of patients. In addition, the system can solicit help from recovered but self-quarantined medical workers to alleviate shortages in the medical workforce and free healthy medical workers to fight COVID-19 on the front line. Thus, it optimizes the usage of local medical resources and prevents cross-infections among medical workers and patients.","output":"Monitoring and Management of Home-Quarantined Patients With COVID-19 Using a WeChat-Based Telemedicine System: Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to explore measures taken into consideration by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in response to COVID-19.

Fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane is required for release of viral genomic material, so the virus can ultimately reproduce and spread. To drive fusion, the F protein undergoes an irreversible conformational change, transitioning from a metastable pre-fusion conformation to a more thermodynamically stable post-fusion structure. Understanding the elements that control stability of the pre-fusion state and triggering to the post-fusion conformation is important for understanding F protein function. Mutations in F protein transmembrane (TM) domains implicated the TM domain in the fusion process, but the structural and molecular details in fusion remain unclear. Previously, analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to demonstrate that isolated TM domains of Hendra virus F protein associate in a monomer-trimer equilibrium (Smith, E. C., Smith, S. E., Carter, J. R., Webb, S. R., Gibson, K. M., Hellman, L. M., Fried, M. G., and Dutch, R. E. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 35726-35735). To determine factors driving this association, 140 paramyxovirus F protein TM domain sequences were analyzed. A heptad repeat of -branched residues was found, and analysis of the Hendra virus F TM domain revealed a heptad repeat leucine-isoleucine zipper motif (LIZ). Replacement of the LIZ with alanine resulted in dramatically reduced TM-TM association. Mutation of the LIZ in the whole protein resulted in decreased protein stability, including pre-fusion conformation stability. Together, our data suggest that the heptad repeat LIZ contributed to TM-TM association and is important for F protein function and pre-fusion stability.","output":"Hendra virus fusion protein transmembrane domain contributes to pre-fusion protein stability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The global effort to vaccinate people against SARS-CoV-2 during an ongoing pandemic has raised questions about how vaccine breakthrough infections compare with infections in immunologically naive individuals, and the potential for vaccinated individuals to transmit the virus.

In a urogynecologic population, increased patient preparedness has been associated with improved symptoms and quality of life. Conversely, women who felt unprepared for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery were more likely to report postoperative dissatisfaction and perceived complications. Health care providers and patients differ in their perception of complications and their severity.

Telehealth counseling is convenient for both patient and health care provider and is efficient. In addition, the limited travel and decreased resource consumption lower costs.

The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to determine if a preoperative counseling phone call is equivalent to a preoperative counseling office visit among women undergoing POP surgery. A second aim was to compare postoperative patient satisfaction with the decision to have surgery in women who received a preoperative counseling phone call and those with a preoperative counseling office visit. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a preoperative counseling phone call or office visit. The primary outcome, patient preparedness, was measured at the postoperative visit on a 5-point Likert scale using the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was chosen based on clinical judgment. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary and secondary outcomes. A total of 120 women were randomized. The study was ended early because of COVID-19 and subsequent cancellations of surgery. Of the randomized patients, 85 had primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age of patients was 62.0 (SD, 1.0) years;64 (75.3%) had stage III or IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness at the postoperative visit, was equivalent in the 2 groups (office, n = 42 [97.7%];phone, n = 42 [97.6%];P < 0.001;95% confidence interval, -0.10 to 0.10). Most women expressed preference for a phone call (n = 66 [65.5%]). More women in the phone group preferred a phone call (phone: 90.5% vs office: 40.5%;P < 0.001). Overall, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their choice of counseling method. This study demonstrates that a phone call is equivalent to an office visit for patient preparedness before POP surgery, suggesting that telehealth modalities should be considered an option for preoperative patient counseling. The results are consistent with the growing body of literature in support of telehealth from both a feasibility and patient preference standpoint. Future studies should investigate patient attitude toward and acceptance of preoperative video visits.","output":"Patient Preparedness for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Surgery: A Randomized Equivalence Trial of Preoperative Counseling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last decade, the control of avian influenza virus has experienced many difficulties, which have caused major global agricultural problems that have also led to public health consequences. Conventional biochemical methods are not sufficient to detect and control agricultural pathogens in the field due to the growing demand for food and subsidiary products; thus, studies aiming to develop potent alternatives to conventional biochemical methods are urgently needed. In this review, emerging detection systems, their applicability to diagnostics, and their therapeutic possibilities in view of nanotechnology are discussed. Nanotechnology-based sensors are used for rapid, sensitive and cost-effective diagnostics of agricultural pathogens. The application of different nanomaterials promotes interactions between these materials and the virus, which enables researchers to construct portable electroanalytical biosensing analyser that should effectively detect the influenza virus.

Systemic involvement in COVID-19 is due to the ubiquitous expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, responsible for the entry in the cells of SARS-CoV-2, Several reports in humans and animal models showed a significant ACE2 mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary cells. Moreover, higher mortality and poorer outcomes have been widely described in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetes and vertebral fractures, which are all highly prevalent in subjects with pituitary dysfunctions. AIM: To review the main endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 with their possible implications for pituitary diseases, the possible direct and indirect involvement of the pituitary gland in COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of established pituitary diseases which can be already at increased risk for worse outcomes and on neurosurgical activities as well as vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underlines that there could be a specific involvement of the pituitary gland which fits into a progressively shaping endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. Moreover, the care for pituitary diseases need to continue despite the restrictions due to the emergency. Several pituitary diseases, such as hypopituitarism and Cushing disease, or due to frequent comorbidities such as diabetes may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in affected patients. There is the urgent need to collect in international multicentric efforts data on all these aspects of the pituitary involvement in the pandemic in order to issue evidence driven recommendations for the management of pituitary patients in the persistent COVID-19 emergency.","output":"COVID-19 and the pituitary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The overuse of antibiotics and the scarcity of new drugs have led to a serious antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially for multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of a marine antibiotic equisetin in combination with colistin against Gram-negative bacteria and explored the mechanisms of synergistic activity. We tested the synergistic effect of equisetin in combination with colistin on 23 clinical mcr-1 positive isolates and found that 4 g/mL equisetin combined with 1 g/mL colistin showed 100% inhibition. Consistently, equisetin restored the sensitivity of 10 species of mcr-1 positive Gram-negative bacteria to colistin. The combination of equisetin and colistin quickly killed 99.9% bacteria in one hour in time-kill assays. We found that colistin promoted intracellular accumulation of equisetin in colistin-resistant E. coli based on LC-MS/MS analysis. Interestingly, equisetin boosted ROS accumulation in E. coli in the presence of colistin. Moreover, we found that equisetin and colistin lost the synergistic effect in two LPS-deficient A. baumannii strains. These findings suggest that colistin destroys the hydrophobic barrier of Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating equisetin to enter the cell and exert its antibacterial effect. Lastly, equisetin restored the activity of colistin in a G. mellonella larvae infection model. Collectively, these results reveal that equisetin can potentiate colistin activity against MDR Gram-negative bacteria including colistin-resistant strains, providing an alternative approach to address Gram-negative pathogens associated with infections in clinics.","output":"Equisetin Restores Colistin Sensitivity against Multi-Drug Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization established that the risk of suffering severe symptoms from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is higher for some groups, but this does not mean their chances of infection are higher.

Stressing the risk for vulnerable groups may also prompt inferences that individuals not highlighted in the message have lower risk than previously believed. In five studies, we investigated how U.K. residents interpreted such risk messages about COVID-19 (n = 396, n = 399, n = 432, n = 474) and a hypothetical new virus (n = 454). Participants recognized that the risk was about experiencing severe symptoms, but over half also believed that the risk was about infection, and had a corresponding heightened perception that vulnerable people were more likely to be infected. Risk messages that clarified the risk event reduced misinterpretations for a hypothetical new virus, but existing misinterpretations of coronavirus risks were resistant to correction.

Objective: To systematically review evidence for the risk factors of COVID-19 patients progressing to critical illness. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic databases. The American agency for health research and quality tool was used for quality assessment. A meta-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: Twenty articles (4062 patients) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First and foremost, we observed that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infections. Second, compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more serious symptoms such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, abnormal laboratory tests were more prevalent in severe patients than in mild cases, such as elevated levels of white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review exploring the risk factors for severe illness in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined risk factors and biomarkers for ARDS development and mortality in two prospective cohort studies. METHODS: We examined clinical risk factors for ARDS in a cohort of 178 patients in Beijing, China who were admitted to the ICU and were at high risk for ARDS. Identified biomarkers were then replicated in a second cohort of1,878 patients in Boston, USA. RESULTS: Of 178 patients recruited from participating hospitals in Beijing, 75 developed ARDS. After multivariate adjustment, sepsis (odds ratio [OR]:5.58, 95% CI: 1.70C18.3), pulmonary injury (OR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.60C6.47), and thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count <8010(3)/L, (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.27C5.62)were significantly associated with increased risk of developing ARDS. Thrombocytopenia was also associated with increased mortality in patients who developed ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.07C1.57) but not in those who did not develop ARDS(AHR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96C1.62).

We aim to describe self-managed abortion (SMA) experiences of people recruited outside of clinics, including their motivations for SMA, pregnancy confirmation and decision-making processes, method choices, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 2017, we conducted 14 in-depth interviews with self-identified females of reproductive age who recently reported in an online survey administered to Ipsos KnowledgePanel that, since 2000, they had attempted SMA while living in the United States. We asked participants about their reproductive histories, experiences seeking reproductive health care, and SMA experiences. We used an iterative process to develop codes and analyzed transcripts using thematic content analysis methods. RESULTS: Motivations and perceptions of effectiveness varied by whether participants had confirmed the pregnancy prior to SMA. Participants who confirmed their pregnancies chose SMA because it was convenient, accessible, and private. Those who did not test for pregnancy were motivated by a preference for autonomy and felt empowered by the ability to try something on their own before seeking facility-based care. Participants prioritized methods that were safe and available, though not always effective. Most used herbs or over-the-counter medications; none used self-sourced abortion medications, mifepristone and/or misoprostol. Five participants obtained facility-based abortions and one participant decided to continue the pregnancy after attempting SMA. The remaining eight reported being no longer pregnant after SMA. None of the participants sought care for SMA complications; one participant saw a provider to confirm abortion completion. CONCLUSIONS: There are many types of SMA experiences. In addition to those who pursue SMA as a last resort (after facing barriers to facility-based care) or as a first resort (because they prefer homeopathic remedies), our findings show that some individuals view SMA as a potential interim step worth trying after suspecting pregnancy and before accessing facility-based care.

Exacerbations of asthma are an important component of risk but have not received as much attention as the day-to-day symptoms that make up impairment. The purpose of this review is to report what has recently been learned about exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS Exacerbations occur in the context of both controlled and uncontrolled asthma. Exacerbations are a strong independent risk factor of further exacerbations. This suggests that unrecognized factors may be involved in susceptibility to exacerbations in addition to more commonly recognized triggers such as viruses, allergens, and poorly controlled asthma. Such factors may be the result of genetic variation. Recent evidence now shows a residual effect on lung function from an exacerbation event. There are no current specific intervention measures to prevent exacerbations but attention to management practices continues to look at the role of the emergency department in improving care. SUMMARY The presence of exacerbations is considered a risk factor of the likelihood of further exacerbations and requires assessment of the triggers identified with history of exacerbations, host factors, atopic disposition, exposure to allergens, adherence to prescribed medications, and preventive measures to reduce future risk of such an event.","output":"The exacerbation component of impairment and risk in pediatric asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The safe, highly effective measles vaccine has been recommended globally since 1974, yet in 2017 there were more than 17 million cases of measles and 83,400 deaths in children under 5 years old, and more than 99% of both occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)1-4.

To date, no research has exclusively investigated the implications of adopting additive manufacturing technology for supply chain resilience, and this study aims to overcome this knowledge gap by using the existing literature and drawing on the dynamic capabilities view. Hence, a systematic search of the literature followed by a critical review of the gathered evidence from 87 peer-reviewed journal papers is performed, leading to the generation of propositions on how additive manufacturing adoption impacts the state of the supply chain, thus influencing certain supply chain capabilities and vulnerabilities that affect supply chain resilience. These propositions provide a research agenda to empirically examine how adopting different processes and applications of additive manufacturing technology can affect supply chain resilience in different industries. Additionally, this study puts forward a detailed framework that indicates how and to what extent adopting additive manufacturing can influence the supply chain capabilities and vulnerabilities that underlie supply chain resilience. While the results suggest that adopting additive manufacturing is expected to improve supply chain resilience by mainly enhancing the state of the supply chain and positively influencing certain supply chain capabilities, it can also cause certain supply chain vulnerabilities to arise, which seem to be interrelated with some of the present additive manufacturing adoption barriers. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.","output":"The implications of additive manufacturing technology adoption for supply chain resilience: A systematic search and review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recently enacted Dutch law enables businesses and organizations to avoid bankruptcy through a court-approved restructuring plan.

There is evidence of GI pathogen transmission when people are in close contact. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the sudden implementation of wide spread social distancing measures in the United States. There is strong evidence that social distancing measures impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and a growing body of research indicates that these measures also decrease the transmission of other respiratory pathogens. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 social distancing mandates on the GI pathogen positivity rates. METHODS: De-identified gastrointestinal panel PCR test results from a routinely collected diagnostic database from January 1, 2019 through August 31, 2020 were analyzed for positivity percentage. An interrupted time series was performed, using social distancing mandate issuance dates as the intervention date. Three target organisms were chosen for the final analysis to represent different primary transmission routes: adenovirus F40/41, norovirus GI/GII, and Escherichia coli O157. RESULTS: In total, 84,223 total test results from nine states were included in the final dataset. With the exception of E. coli O157 in Kansas, Michigan and Nebraska, we observed an immediate decrease in positivity percentage during the week of social distancing mandates for all other targets and states. Norovirus GI/GII showed the most notable drop in positivity, while E. coli O157 appeared to be least impacted by social distancing mandates. While we acknowledge the analysis has a multiple testing problem, the majority of our significant results showed significance even at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of social distancing mandates meant for COVID-19 on GI pathogen positivity, and we discovered that social distancing measures did in fact decrease positivity initially.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 volumes of intravenous convalescent plasma (CP) with high antibody titers for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a Bayesian, randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled clinical trial in 7 Brazilian hospitals. Adults admitted to hospital with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2, within 10 days of the symptom onset, were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive standard of care (SoC) alone, or in combination with 200 mL (150C300 mL) of CP (Low-volume), or 400 mL (300C600 mL) of CP (High-volume); infusion had to be performed within 24 h of randomization. Randomization was centralized, stratified by center. The primary outcome was the time until clinical improvement up to day 28, measured by the WHO ten-point scale, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Interim and terminal analyses were performed in a Bayesian framework. Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04415086. FINDINGS: Between June 2, 2020, and November 18, 2020, 129 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to SoC (n = 42), Low-volume (n = 43) or High-volume (n = 44) CP.

Automatic algorithms for image analysis have thus become an invaluable tool in medicine. Examples of this are two- and three-dimensional visualizations, image segmentation, and the registration of all anatomical structure and pathology types. In this context, we introduce Studierfenster (www.studierfenster.at): a free, non-commercial open science client-server framework for (bio-)medical image analysis. Studierfenster offers a wide range of capabilities, including the visualization of medical data (CT, MRI, etc.) in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space in common web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Other functionalities are the calculation of medical metrics (dice score and Hausdorff distance), manual slice-by-slice outlining of structures in medical images, manual placing of (anatomical) landmarks in medical imaging data, visualization of medical data in virtual reality (VR), and a facial reconstruction and registration of medical data for augmented reality (AR). More sophisticated features include the automatic cranial implant design with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the inpainting of aortic dissections with a generative adversarial network, and a CNN for automatic aortic landmark detection in CT angiography images. A user study with medical and non-medical experts in medical image analysis was performed, to evaluate the usability and the manual functionalities of Studierfenster. When participants were asked about their overall impression of Studierfenster in an ISO standard (ISO-Norm) questionnaire, a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points were achieved. The evaluation also provided insights into the results achievable with Studierfenster in practice, by comparing these with two ground truth segmentations performed by a physician of the Medical University of Graz in Austria. In this contribution, we presented an online environment for (bio-)medical image analysis. In doing so, we established a client-server-based architecture, which is able to process medical data, especially 3D volumes. Our online environment is not limited to medical applications for humans. Rather, its underlying concept could be interesting for researchers from other fields, in applying the already existing functionalities or future additional implementations of further image processing applications. An example could be the processing of medical acquisitions like CT or MRI from animals [Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 84(4):448C456, 68], which get more and more common, as veterinary clinics and centers get more and more equipped with such imaging devices. Furthermore, applications in entirely non-medical research in which images/volumes need to be processed are also thinkable, such as those in optical measuring techniques, astronomy, or archaeology.","output":"Studierfenster: an Open Science Cloud-Based Medical Imaging Analysis Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on the economies of the EU member states.

Debt sustainability has been severely affected by decreasing fiscal space, and there are significant concerns that a debt crisis is looming on the horizon for the EU. The current study aims to analyze environmental taxes as a potential solution for rebuilding fiscal space and thus improving debt sustainability in the EU. The research method used to study the impact that the four types of environmental taxes may have on fiscal space is the dynamic panel regression model, estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The conclusions show that all four categories of environmental taxes can help the EU member states regain fiscal space and improve their debt sustainability.

The aim of the present study was to assess whether a high BMI affects the risk of death or prolonged length of stay (LOS) in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care in Sweden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this observational, register-based study, we included patients with COVID-19 from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Sweden. Outcomes assessed were death during intensive care and ICU LOS 14 days. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the association (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) between BMI and the outcomes. Valid weight and height information could be retrieved in 1,649 patients (1,227 (74.4%) males) with COVID-19. We found a significant association between BMI and the risk of the composite outcome death or LOS 14 days in survivors (OR per standard deviation [SD] increase 1.30, 95%CI 1.16C1.44, adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities), and this association remained after further adjustment for severity of illness (simplified acute physiology score; SAPS3) at ICU admission (OR 1.30 per SD, 95%CI 1.17C1.45). Individuals with a BMI  35 kg/m(2) had a doubled risk of the composite outcome. A high BMI was also associated with death during intensive care and a prolonged LOS in survivors assessed as separate outcomes. The main limitations were the restriction to the first wave of the pandemic, and the lack of information on socioeconomic status as well as smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of Swedish ICU patients with COVID-19, a high BMI was associated with increasing risk of death and prolonged length of stay in the ICU.

Many hospitals cancelled elective surgeries to brace for the pandemic thus impacting many neurosurgical patients that had their surgeries postponed. METHODS: We implemented several measures for staff and patients to minimize the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For surgical clearance, all patients needed to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 within 48h prior to the non-elective surgery. A triage protocol was implemented to manage patients in need of non-elective surgeries. A drive-through testing center was developed for preoperative surgical clearance to triage cases in need of non-elective surgery. Similarly, all patients admitted to the hospital were tested. Telemedicine played a big role in evaluating the need of surgery. We reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data for all patients that underwent surgery within the neurosurgery department from March 26th to April 22nd 2020. RESULTS: Using a combination of preoperative outpatient COVID-19 drive-through and inpatient testing to help obtain surgical clearance with selected telemedicine evaluations, 103 non-elective neurosurgical procedures were performed on 102 patients. No patients tested positive for the COVID-19 testing prior to surgery. None of the operated patients developed any COVID-19 symptoms during their hospitalization or were re-admitted to our ED postoperatively for COVID-19 symptoms. A subset of patients developed symptoms suspect for COVID-19 post-operatively but were retested and all tested negative. CONCLUSION: We describe a multi-faceted preoperative triage protocol for safely performing non-elective neurosurgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could help other neurosurgical departments and hospitals minimize coronavirus exposure for patients and healthcare workers. We believe this triage strategy helps safely identify selected patients in need of neurosurgical care amidst hospital capacity concerns, COVID-19 testing limitations, limited personal protective equipment, and this approach could be implemented at other centers to gradually restart a process towards elective surgeries in a safe way.","output":"Path to Reopening Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Neurosurgery Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has negative consequences for many parts of life.

The causative agent is an Arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV). The pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS are poorly understood, but are believed to correlate with the ability of PRRSV to inhibit immune responses of the host. However, precisely how the virus is capable of doing so remains obscure. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection led to reduced ubiquitination of cellular proteins. Screening all of the 12 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) encoded by PRRSV revealed that, apart from the Nsp2 which contains the deubiqintinating (DUB) ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, Nsp11, which encodes a unique and conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) throughout the Nidovirus order, also possesses DUB activity. In vivo assay demonstrated that Nsp11 specifically removed lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains and the conserved sites C112, H144, D173, K180, and Y219 were critical for its DUB activity. Remarkably, DUB activity was responsible for the capacity of Nsp11 to inhibit nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation. Mutations abrogating the DUB activity of Nsp11 toward K48-linked polyubiquitin chains of IB nullified the suppressive effect on NF-B. Our data add Nsp11 to the list of DUBs encoded by PRRSV and uncover a novel mechanism by which PRRSV cripples host innate immune responses.","output":"The nonstructural protein 11 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus inhibits NF-B signaling by means of its deubiquitinating activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a great deal of pressure for medical students, who typically show elevated anxiety rates.

Two researchers independently searched PubMed on 26 August 2020 for cross-sectional studies on medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, with no language restrictions applied. We then performed a manual search to detect other potentially eligible investigations. To the 1361 records retrieved in the initial search, 4 more were added by manual search on medRxiv.

The prevalence of anxiety in medical students is similar to that prior to the pandemic but correlates with several specific COVID-related stressors. While some preventive and risk factors have been previously identified in a non-pandemic context, knowledge and cognitions on COVID-19 transmission, treatment, prognosis and prevention negatively correlate with anxiety, emerging as a key preventive factor that may provide a rationale for why the levels of anxiety have remained stable in medical students during the pandemic while increasing in their non-medical peers and the general population.

This study examined adolescents' postquarantine depressive symptoms associated with pandemic stressors. The primary aim was to identify potential protective factors that may buffer the association between the presence of COVID-19 cases in adolescents' communities and their postquarantine depressive symptoms. METHODS: Adolescents from public schools were recruited from Zhengzhou city, Henan, China (N = 1,487, Mage=13.14 years, 50% girls). Adolescents reported the presence of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases in their communities, their daily activities and routines during the 2-month quarantine period, and depressive symptoms after the quarantine period. RESULTS: The presence of cases in adolescents' communities during the quarantine contributed to more depressive symptoms in adolescents after the quarantine. This association was buffered by adolescents' spending more time on physical activities and better maintenance of daily living routines during the quarantine period. The presence of community infection was also more strongly associated with depressive symptoms in older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of COVID-19 cases in communities contributed to adolescents' poorer mental health, and the association was stronger for older adolescents.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the association of social disconnectedness and perceived social isolation (PSI) on health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and life satisfaction in adults with dysvascular lower extremity amputation (LEA). STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. METHODS Data were collected from community-dwelling adults with dysvascular major LEA (N = 231). The main outcome measures were the Short-Form 36 and the Life Satisfaction-11. Other measures were used to quantify comorbidities/secondary health conditions, PSI, social disconnectedness, self-efficacy, social support, and social engagement. Three hierarchical regression models were conducted to predict (1) physical HrQoL, (2) mental HrQoL, and (3) life satisfaction. RESULTS Approximately one-third of the sample had high levels of social disconnectedness and PSI. The regression model predicting physical HrQoL accounted for 47% of the variance and only found that higher levels of mobility, lower perceived impact of comorbidities/conditions, and higher levels of social engagement and self-efficacy were associated with better physical HrQoL. A model predicting mental HrQoL accounted for 36% of the variance, with older age, lower PSI, and higher levels of self-efficacy being significant predictors. Finally, the model predicting life satisfaction accounted for 56% of the variance, with older age, lower perceived impact of comorbidities/conditions, and higher self-efficacy remaining as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS These findings highlight that one-third of our sample were at risk for being socially isolated and that PSI was influential on mental HrQoL and life satisfaction.

Whether targeting dysbiosis will improve outcomes of COVID\\\\19 is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effects of a novel gut microbiota\\\\derived synbiotic formula (SIM01) as an adjuvant therapy on immunological responses and changes in gut microbiota of hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients. METHODS: This was an open\\\\label, proof\\\\of\\\\concept study. Consecutive COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to an infectious disease referral center in Hong Kong were given a novel formula of Bifidobacteria strains, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharide, and resistant dextrin (SIM01). The latter was derived from metagenomic databases of COVID\\\\19 patients and healthy population. COVID\\\\19 patients who were admitted under another independent infectious disease team during the same period without receiving SIM01 acted as controls. All patients received standard treatments for COVID\\\\19 according to the hospital protocol. We assessed antibody response, plasma proinflammatory markers, nasopharyngeal SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral load, and fecal microbiota profile from admission up to week 5. RESULTS: Twenty\\\\five consecutive COVID\\\\19 patients received SIM01 for 28 days; 30 patients who did not receive the formula acted as controls. Significantly more patients receiving SIM01 than controls developed SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgG antibody (88% vs 63.3%; P = 0.037) by Day 16. One (4%) and 8 patients (26.7%) in the SIM01 and control group, respectively, failed to develop positive IgG antibody upon discharge. At week 5, plasma levels of interleukin (IL)\\\\6, monocyte chemoattractant protein\\\\1 (MCP\\\\1), macrophage colony\\\\stimulating factor (M\\\\CSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\\\\), and IL\\\\1RA reduced significantly in the SIM01 but not in the control group.

Chest imaging is used for the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients and can address problems concerning Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) shortcomings. Chest X-ray images can act as an appropriate alternative to Computed Tomography (CT) for diagnosing Covid-19. The purpose of this study is to use a Deep Learning method for diagnosing Covid-19 cases using chest X-ray images. Thus, we propose Covidense based on the pre-trained Densenet-201 model and is trained on a dataset comprising chest X-ray images of Covid-19, normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia cases. Materials and Methods: In this study, a total number of 1280 chest X-ray images of Covid-19, normal, bacterial and viral pneumonia cases were collected from open access repositories. Covidense, a convolutional neural network model, is based on the pre-trained DenseNet-201 architecture, and after pre-processing the images, it has been trained and tested on the images using the 5-fold cross-validation method. Results: The accuracy of different classifications including classification of two classes (Covid-19, normal), three classes 1 (Covid-19, normal and bacterial pneumonia), three classes 2 (Covid-19, normal and viral pneumonia), and four classes (Covid-19, normal, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia) are 99.46%, 92.86%, 93.91 %, and 91.01% respectively. Conclusion: This model can differentiate pneumonia caused by Covid-19 from other types of pneumonia, including bacterial and viral.

COVID-19 is highly contagious so that it has infected more than 1,848,439 people until 14 April 2020 and killed more than 117,217 people. The main aim of this study is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates the spatio-temporal outbreak of COVID-19. The main innovation of this research is investigating the impacts of various strategies of school and educational center closures, heeding social distancing, and office closures on controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in Urmia city, Iran. In this research, the outbreak of COVID-19 disease was simulated with the help of ABM so that all agents considered in the ABM along with their attributes and behaviors as well as the environment of the ABM were described. Besides, the transmission of COVID-19 between human agents was simulated based on the SEIRD model, and finally, all control strategies applied in Urmia city along with corresponding actions of each control strategy were implemented in the ABM. The results of the ABM indicated that school and educational center closures in Urmia city, reduced the number of infected people by 4.96% each week on average and 49.61% in total from February 21 until May 10. Heeding social distancing by 30% and 70% of people of Urmia city from March 27, led to decrease the number of infected people by 5.24% and 10.07% each week, on average and 31.46% and 60.44% in total, respectively, and if 30% and 70% of civil servants of Urmia city did not go to work, the number of infected people would be decreased by 3.30% and 5.25% each week, on average and 32.98% and 52.48% in total from February 21 until May 10, respectively. As a result of this research, heeding social distancing by the majority of people is recommended for Urmia city in the current situation.

The sections evaluated HCWs emotions, perceived stressors, factors that reduced their stress, coping strategies, and motivators for future outbreaks. Responses were scored on a scale from 0-3 and reported as mean and standard deviation. Student t-test was used to compare the difference in responses between the two outbreaks. Results Completed questionnaires were returned by 62 (78%) participants. In the assessment of HCWs EMOTIONS, the strongest feelings were similar in both outbreaks and included the ethical obligation of HCWs to keep working amidst tiring long hours and fear of personal safety (score&gt;2/3;p&gt;0.3).

Patients in RS group had more other neurological disease history except for epilepsy than those in NS group and EH group(7/10[70%] VS 1/13 [7.7%]VS1/7[14.3%]), and the difference between RS group and NS group is significant (P < 0.05). Patients in NE group and RS group suffered more severe/critical COVID-19 infection than patients in EH group (10/13[76.9%] VS 6/10[60%] VS 1/7[14.3%]),and the difference between NS group and EH group is significant (P < 0.05). 36.7% of patients had 1 to 5 complications,and 46.4% of patients had 6-10 complications.The complications in patients with seizure(in RS group and NS group) seem to be more than those without seizure(in EH group), but it doesnt have statistic difference. The proportion of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) treatment before admission was higher in EH group than in RE group(7/7 [100%] VS 2/10 [20%], P < 0.05). The mortality of 30 patients with epilepsy and COVID-19 was 36.67%. The mortality of NS group(38.5%) and RS group(50%) were a little higher than in EH group(14.3%). None of convalescent patients had recurrent seizure, and there was no more death in the 3 month follow-up after discharge. Conclusions COVID-19 Patients with recurrent epileptic seizure had more underlying neurological diseases than patients who had epilepsy history but without seizure.Patients with new-onset and recurrent epileptic seizure suffered more sever/critical COVID-19, which may lead to a worse prognosis.If patients with epilepsy history continue using AEDs during COVID-19 pandemics, the risk of recurrent seizure may reduce, and a good prognosis for patients with epilepsy history could be expected.","output":"Clinical characteristics of 30 COVID-19 patients with epilepsy: a retrospective study in Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are often treated with disease modifying therapies (DMT) with immunomodulatory effects. This is of particular concern following the development of several vaccines to combat coronavirus disease 19 (COVD-19), a potentially fatal illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. Objectives To determine the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pwMS and the impact of disease modifying therapies (DMT) on vaccine response. Methods This is a prospective longitudinal study in pwMS. Longitudinal serum samples were obtained prior to, and after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. A novel neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay was used to determine nAbs titres against SARS-CoV-2 spike. Results We observed that (1) pwMS on B-cell depleting therapies exhibited reduced response to vaccination compared to other pwMS, correlating with time from last anti-CD20 infusion, (2) prior COVID-19 illness, DMT category, and pyramidal function were significant predictors of vaccine responsiveness, and (3) circulating absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and IgG levels correlated with nAb levels. Conclusions We demonstrate that pwMS exhibit reduced nAb response to mRNA vaccination dependent on DMT status and identify predictive biomarkers for vaccine efficacy. We conclude that additional vaccination strategies may be necessary to achieve protective immunity in pwMS.","output":"Neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated people with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19 that can result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can cause significant mortality, leading to concern that immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis and other disorders have significant risks for both infection and ARDS. OBJECTIVE: : To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis. OBSERVATIONS: : Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection. However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS. IMPLICATIONS: : In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19. In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection. However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The underpinning biology relating to multiple sclerosis disease modifying treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City hospitals expanded resources to an unprecedented extent in response to the COVID pandemic.

Often guidelines recommend analysis based on the payer perspective, but suggest that a supplemental analysis based on the societal perspective may be submitted that includes productivity losses/gains. However, there is no universally recognized framework for the approach to including productivity losses and gains in pharmacoeconomic analyses. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to systematically review literature on cost-effectiveness analyses of drug interventions that included costs associated with productivity losses/gains and to summarize the types cost elements included and cost calculation methods employed. Moreover, this study examines variations in the calculation of productivity losses/gains by target disease type, geographic region, income group, period of analysis, and analysis time horizon-as well as the impact of their inclusion on the study outcomes. METHODS A search of three databases was performed, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, to identify cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses that included indirect costs such as productivity losses/gains. Publications from January 2010 to October 2019 were examined and selected for inclusion by two independent reviewers. In addition to the citation details, data on the country of analysis, country income group, target disease area, study sponsorship, type of analysis, study design, time horizon, analysis perspective, productivity loss/gain elements included, the approach used to estimate productivity losses/gains, and the impact of their inclusion on the study outcome-namely the incremental cost effectiveness ratio-were extracted and summarized. RESULTS The search strategy identified 5038 unique studies, and 208 were included in the final analysis. Among the studies reviewed, 165 (79%) were conducted in high-income countries and 160 (77%) were conducted for North American and European/Central Asian countries. The productivity loss/gain elements included in the analysis were reported for 169 studies (81%). Absenteeism only was included for 98 studies (47%), and absenteeism plus presenteeism was included for 29 studies (14%). Absenteeism plus some other element such as costs associated with unemployment and/or early retirement was included for 32 studies (15%) examined. Only one out of four of the studies reviewed included information on the approach used to estimate productivity losses/gains, which was predominantly the human capital approach. One-hundred forty-four studies (69%) reported the impact of including productivity losses/gains on the ICER, with 110 studies (53%) reporting that their inclusion contributed to more favorable cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Although inclusion of productivity losses/gains was shown to have a favorable impact on evaluations for many studies, their impact and method of calculation was often not reported or was unclear. Further examination and discussion is needed to consider the optimal framework for considering productivity losses/gains in cost-effectiveness analyses, including the appropriate cost elements to include (e.g., patient absenteeism, caregiver absenteeism, presenteeism, unemployment, etc.) and how those costs should be estimated.","output":"Use of Productivity Loss/Gain in Cost-Effectiveness Analyses for Drugs: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurately modelling user behaviour has the potential to significantly improve the quality of human-computer interaction.

Propofol is known to inhibit airway reflexes. We evaluated the incidence and severity of coughing in adults who received a subhypnotic dose of propofol at the end of sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia. METHODS Sixty patients, aged 18-65 years, undergoing elective nasal surgery under general anesthesia using sevoflurane and remifentanil were randomly allocated to the propofol group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 30). At the end of surgery, sevoflurane and remifentanil infusion was stopped. After 3 min, the propofol group received propofol 0.3 mg/kg and the control group received normal saline 0.03 ml/kg. The incidence and severity of cough, recovery time and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated during the emergence period. RESULTS During emergence, the propofol group had the significantly lower incidence (60 vs. 87%) and severity of coughing compared with the control group (P = 0.04, P = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and recovery time during emergence between the two groups.

As there is no randomized data, the purpose of this study was to systematically review the available literature on proton therapy in this setting, focusing on the toxicity endpoints. Materials and Methods A systematic search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was conducted in 5 databases: PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A total of 491 studies were found on the topic of NPC and proton therapy. Following independent study selection by 2 investigators, 9 studies were found to have sufficient focus and relevance to be incorporated into the systematic review. Results All 9 studies were retrospective and examined only NPC patients except for one that also included paranasal sinus cancer. One study was a reirradiation study. Four studies used 3D or double scatter technique, while all others used intensity-modulated proton therapy. Oncologic outcomes were similar to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) rates, with 2-year local and regional progression-free survival (LRFS) ranging from 84% to 100%, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 75% to 88.9%, and 2-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 88% to 95% in the up-front setting. Four comparison studies with IMRT found significantly lower feeding tube rates (20% versus 65%, P = .015; and 14% versus 85%, P < .001) with proton therapy as well as lower mucositis (G2 46% versus 70%, P = .019; and G3 11% versus 76%, P = .0002). All other acute and late effects were largely improved with proton therapy but not statistically significant. Conclusions NPC patients receiving proton therapy maintain good outcomes with improved toxicity profile, likely due to sparing of dose to normal structures.

Previous studies reported conflicting results-impaired and intact verbal fluency-in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies concentrate on overall word productivity, errors, perseverations, clustering, or switching. We used a comprehensive approach to evaluate the reported discrepancy in the literature and introduced a new angle using the concept of word abstraction and imageability. Moreover, we analyzed the performance in two-time intervals (0-30 s and 31-60 s) to assess the temporal dynamics of verbal fluency and a possible activation or initiation deficit in autism. Sixteen adults with ASD and 16 neurotypical control participants, matched by gender, age, and education level, participated in our study. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a significant difference between groups in word productivity, the number of errors, clustering, or temporal dynamics, neither in semantic nor in phonemic fluency tasks. Surprisingly, the two study groups' performance did not differ in terms of imageability or concreteness characteristics either. Our results raise the possibility that verbal fluency performance is intact in autism. We also suggest using a comprehensive approach when measuring fluency in autism. LAY SUMMARY: People with autism tend to think and communicate differently. In our study, we tested whether people with autism come up with more concrete or imageable words and whether their performance is better compared with neurotypicals in the beginning or in the later phase of a task measuring how many words they can produce in a minute.

After the epidemic, the Government of Sierra Leone prioritized community engagement to increase vaccination confidence and uptake. To support these efforts, we examined potential drivers of vaccination confidence and uptake in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We conducted a population-based household survey with primary caregivers of children in a birth cohort of 12 to 23 months in four districts with low vaccination coverage in Sierra Leone in 2019. Modified Poisson regression modeling with robust variance estimation was used to examine if perceived community engagement in planning the immunization program in the community was associated with vaccination confidence and having a fully vaccinated child. RESULTS: The sample comprised 621 age-eligible children and their caregivers (91% response rate). Half of the caregivers (52%) reported that it usually takes too long to get to the vaccination site, and 36% perceived that health workers expect money for vaccination services that are supposed to be given at no charge. When mothers were the decision-makers of the childrens vaccination, 80% of the children were fully vaccinated versus 69% when fathers were the decision-makers and 56% when other relatives were the decision-makers. Caregivers with high confidence in vaccination were more likely to have fully vaccinated children compared to caregivers with low confidence (78% versus 53%). For example, caregivers who thought vaccines are very much safe were more likely to have fully vaccinated children than those who thought vaccines are somewhat safe (76% versus 48%). Overall, 53% of caregivers perceived high level of community engagement, 41% perceived medium level of engagement, and 6% perceived low level of engagement. Perceiving high community engagement was associated with expressing high vaccination confidence (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 2.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.67-4.04) and having a fully vaccinated child (aPR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.18-2.38). CONCLUSIONS: In these four low coverage districts in Sierra Leone, the perceived level of community engagement was strongly associated with vaccination confidence among caregivers and vaccination uptake among children.

Considering the importance of orthopedic knowledge for general practitioners and the inadequacy of the orthopedics internship duration in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), we have developed and investigated a smartphone orthopedic educational application named Orthobox. Methods: In a quasi-clinical before-after trial study, we investigated the benefits of Orthobox application for medical interns attending MUMS orthopedic departments. A total of 120 students (64 and 56 students in control and case groups respectively) were recruited. The application consists of five main parts of medication, common order samples, common prescriptions, cast and splint types, and educational movies. Students who passed the course without getting access to the application (control group) and students who were also using application during the course (case group) were defined, and comparison was done between them objectively through final exam score comparison and subjectively through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaire score comparison. Besides, using case group students activity report provided by the application panel, correlational analysis was done on their amount of activity on each of the main parts of the application and the corresponding question exam and VAS score separately. Results: The case group of the study generally achieved higher final exam scores, mainly on Order question score (P value<0.001). Total VAS scores were also greater in case group (P value =0.001). It has also been identified that there is a notable positive trend between students amount of usage of the application and their final exam scores through correlational analysis.

This virus, termed SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2), contains Papain-like protease (PLpro) involved in viral replication and immune response evasion. Drugs targeting this protease therefore have great potential for inhibiting the virus, and have proven successful in older coronaviruses. Here, we introduce two effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 (CoV1) and MERS-CoV to assess their potential for inhibiting CoV2 PLpro. We ran 1 s molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CoV2, CoV1, and MERS-CoV ligand-free PLpro to characterize the dynamics of CoV2 PLpro, and made comparisons between the three to elucidate important similarities and differences relevant to drug design and ubiquitin-like protein binding for deubiquitinating and deISGylating activity of CoV2. Next, we simulated the inhibitors bound to CoV1 and CoV2 PLpro in various poses and at different known binding sites to analyze their binding modes. We found that the naphthalene-based ligand shows strong potential as an inhibitor of CoV2 PLpro by binding at the putative naphthalene inhibitor binding site in both computational predictions and experimental assays. Our modeling work suggested strategies to improve naphthalene-based compounds, and our results from molecular docking showed that the newly designed compounds exhibited improved binding affinity. The other ligand, chemotherapy drug 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), showed little to no stable intermolecular interaction with PLpro and quickly dissociated or remained highly mobile. We demonstrate multiple ways to improve the binding affinity of the naphthalene-based inhibitor scaffold by engaging new residues in the unused space of the binding site.

The highest values for FRAP method were represented by grape seed flour (4716.75 mg Trolox/g), followed by sunflower meals (1350.86 mg Trolox/g) and rapeseed flour (1034.92 mg Trolox/g). For CUPRAC assay, grape seed flour (5936.76 mg Trolox/g) and walnut flour (1202.75 mg Trolox/g) showed the highest antioxidant activity. To assess which method of determining antioxidant activity is most appropriate for the byproducts analyzed, relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) was calculated. Depending on the RACI value of the analyzed byproducts, the rank of antioxidant capacity ranged from -209.46 (walnut flour) to 184.20 (grape seed flour). The most sensitive methods in developing RACI were FRAP (r = 0.5795) and DPPH (r = 0.5766), followed by CUPRAC (r = 0.5578) and ABTS (r = 0.4449), respectively. Strong positive correlations between the antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble compounds measured by PCL and other methods used for determining antioxidant activity were found (r > 0.9). Analyses have shown that the different types of byproducts obtained from the vegetable oil industry have a high antioxidant activity rich in phenolic compounds, and thus their use in bakery products can improve their nutritional quality.","output":"Byproducts (Flour, Meals, and Groats) from the Vegetable Oil Industry as a Potential Source of Antioxidants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread into a pandemic since its emergence in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. This has been facilitated by its high transmissibility within the human population and its ability to remain viable on inanimate surfaces for an extended period. To address the latter, we examined the effect of simulated sunlight on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 spiked into tissue culture medium or mucus. The study revealed that inactivation took 37 minutes in medium and 107 minutes in mucus. These times-to-inactivation were unexpected since they are longer than have been observed in other studies. From this work, we demonstrate that sunlight represents an effective decontamination method but the speed of decontamination is variable based on the underlying matrix.

Although TCE exposure is prevalent, epidemiological studies of TCE exposure associations with adverse birth outcomes are inconclusive. Prior studies show that the TCE metabolite S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) exhibits toxicity in a placental cell line. In the current study, genome-wide gene expression and gene set enrichment analyses were used to identify novel genes and pathway alterations in the HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblast cell line and human placental villous explants treated with DCVC at concentrations relevant to human exposures. In the cells, concentration- and time-dependent effects were observed, as evidenced by the magnitude of altered gene expression after treatment with 20 M DCVC versus 10 M, and 12-h versus 6-h of treatment. Comparing the two models for the transcriptional response to 12-h 20 M DCVC treatment, no differentially expressed genes reached significance in villous explants, whereas 301 differentially expressed genes were detected in HTR-8/SVneo cells compared with non-treated controls (FDR < 0.05 + LogFC > 0.35 [FC > 1.3]). GSEA revealed five upregulated enriched pathways in common between explants and cells (FDR < 0.05). Moreover, all 12-h DCVC treatment groups from both models contained upregulated pathways enriched for genes regulated by the ATF4 transcription factor. The overrepresentation of ATF4 regulation of differentially expressed genes indicated activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a condition triggered by multiple stress stimuli, including the unfolded protein response. DCVC-induced ISR activation was confirmed by elevated eIF2 phosphorylation, ATF4 protein concentrations, and decreased global protein synthesis in HTR-8/SVneo cells. This study identifies a mechanism of DCVC-induced cytotoxicity by revealing the involvement of a specific stress signaling pathway.

However, it remains largely unknown whether infected children develop cellular immune memory. MethodsTo determine whether a memory T cell response is being developed as an indicator for long-term immune protection, we performed a longitudinal assessment of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response by IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT and activation marker expression analyses of peripheral blood samples from children and adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. ResultsUpon stimulation of PBMCs with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or overlapping peptides of spike (S-SARS-CoV-2) and nucleocapsid proteins, we found S-SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-{gamma} T cell responses in most infected children (83%) and all adults (100%) that were absent in unexposed controls. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in infected adults, especially in those with moderate symptoms, compared to infected children. The S-SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} T cell response correlated with S1-SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody concentrations. Predominantly, effector memory CD4+ T cells of a Th1 phenotype were activated upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which persisted for 4-8 weeks after symptom onset. We detected very low frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells in these individuals. ConclusionsOur data indicate that an antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cell response is induced in children and adults with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

When activated, Arfs associate with membranes where they regulate numerous steps of membrane homeostasis. The requirement for GBF1 implies that Arfs are important for replication, but which of the different Arfs function(s) during replication remains poorly understood. Here, we established cell lines expressing each of the human Arfs fused to a fluorescent tag and investigated their behavior during enterovirus infection. Arf1 was the first to be recruited to the replication organelles where it strongly co-localized with the viral antigen 2B and mature virions, but not dsRNA. By the end of the infectious cycle, Arf3, 4, 5 and 6 were also concentrated on the replication organelles. Once on the replication membranes, all Arfs except Arf3 were no longer sensitive to inhibition of GBF1, suggesting that in infected cells they do not actively cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. Only the depletion of Arf1, but not other class 1 and 2 Arfs significantly increased the sensitivity of replication to GBF1 inhibition. Surprisingly, depletion of Arf6, a class 3 Arf, normally implicated in plasma membrane events, also increased the sensitivity to GBF1 inhibition. Together, our results suggest that GBF1-dependent Arf1 activation directly supports the development and/or functioning of the replication complexes and that Arf6 plays a previously unappreciated role in viral replication. Our data reveal a complex pattern of Arf activation in enterovirus-infected cells, which may contribute to the resilience of viral replication in different cellular environments.IMPORTANCE Enteroviruses include many known and emerging pathogens such as poliovirus, enteroviruses 71 and D68, and others. Yet, licensed vaccines are available only against poliovirus and enterovirus 71, and specific anti-enterovirus therapeutics are lacking. Enterovirus infection induces the massive remodeling of intracellular membranes and the development of specialized domains harboring viral replication complexes, replication organelles. Here we investigated the roles of small Arf GTPases during enterovirus infection. Arfs control distinct steps in intracellular membrane traffic, and one of the Arf-activating proteins, GBF1, is a cellular factor required for enterovirus replication. We found that all Arfs expressed in human cells, including Arf6 normally associated with the plasma membrane, are recruited to the replication organelles and that Arf1 appears to be the most important Arf for enterovirus replication. These results document the rewiring of the cellular membrane pathways in infected cells and may provide new ways of controlling enterovirus infections.","output":"Enterovirus infection induces massive recruitment of all isoforms of small cellular Arf GTPases to the replication organelles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic requires the rapid isolation of infected patients Thus, high-sensitivity radiology images could be a key technique to diagnose patients besides the polymerase chain reaction approach Deep learning algorithms are proposed in several studies to detect COVID-19 symptoms due to the success in chest radiography image classification, cost efficiency, lack of expert radiologists, and the need for faster processing in the pandemic area Most of the promising algorithms proposed in different studies are based on pre-trained deep learning models Such open-source models and lack of variation in the radiology image-capturing environment make the diagnosis system vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as fast gradient sign method (FGSM) attack This study therefore explored the potential vulnerability of pre-trained convolutional neural network algorithms to the FGSM attack in terms of two frequently used models, VGG16 and Inception-v3 Firstly, we developed two transfer learning models for X-ray and CT image-based COVID-19 classification and analyzed the performance extensively in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC Secondly, our study illustrates that misclassification can occur with a very minor perturbation magnitude, such as 0 009 and 0 003 for the FGSM attack in these models for X-ray and CT images, respectively, without any effect on the visual perceptibility of the perturbation In addition, we demonstrated that successful FGSM attack can decrease the classification performance to 16 67% and 55 56% for X-ray images, as well as 36% and 40% in the case of CT images for VGG16 and Inception-v3, respectively, without any human-recognizable perturbation effects in the adversarial images Finally, we analyzed that correct class probability of any test image which is supposed to be 1, can drop for both considered models and with increased perturbation;it can drop to 0 24 and 0 17 for the VGG16 model in cases of X-ray and CT images, respectively Thus, despite the need for data sharing and automated diagnosis, practical deployment of such program requires more robustness","output":"Vulnerability in Deep Transfer Learning Models to Adversarial Fast Gradient Sign Attack for COVID-19 Prediction from Chest Radiography Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Classification of disease severity is crucial for the management of COVID-19. Several studies have shown that individual proteins can be used to classify the severity of COVID-19. Here, we aimed to investigate whether integrating the four types of protein context data, namely, protein complexes, stoichiometric ratios, pathways and network degrees will improve the severity classification of COVID-19. Methods: : A SWATH-based proteomic data set of 54 sera samples from 40 COVID-19 patients was employed as the training cohort. Results: : Machine learning prioritized two complexes, one stoichiometric ratio, five pathways, twelve proteins and five network degrees. A model based on these 25 features led to effective classification of severe cases with an AUC of 0.965, outperforming the models with proteins only.

Clinical signs were limited to the respiratory tract in all challenged groups and varied from mild to moderate mouth breathing to severe respiratory signs with snorting sound and extended head. Mortalities were only recorded in mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge group. AIV-H9N2 challenge caused tracheal petechial hemorrhage that progressed to tracheal congestion and caseation. In mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV vaccine challenge, severe tracheitis with bronchial cast formation was observed. In mixed AIV-H9N2/variant IBV challenge severe congestion of the tracheal mucosa and excessive exudates with a tendency to form tubular casts were observed. Kidney ureate deposition was only observed in variant IBV challenge group. Histopathologically, tracheal congestion, severe degeneration, and deciliation were noticed in all groups of mixed infection. Interestingly, hemorrhage and atrophy were observed in thymus gland of birds challenged with single AIV-H9N2 or mixed AIV-H9N2/IBV. There was no difference in the tracheal shedding level of variant IBV between single and mixed infected groups while classical IBV shedding increased in mixed infection group. Interestingly, the AIV-H9N2 showed constantly high shedding titers till 7DPI with variant or vaccine IBV co-infection.

This study aims to more completely define the childcare needs and perspectives of cancer patients with dependent children. Materials and Methods: Between December 2020 and February 2021, cancer patients at one major Canadian Cancer Centre, who identified as primary caregiver to at least 1 dependent (<18 years of age) were invited to partake in a survey study. The survey was developed through consultation with a multidisciplinary team and best survey practices, and consisted of 34 closed and open-ended questions designed to assess childcare needs and the experiences of cancer patients with dependent children.

Sixty-one percent (17/28) reported that the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted their childcare needs and impacted their stress levels moderately (10/17) or extremely (three of 17). Seventy-eight percent (21/27) reported that a flexible childcare service would allow them to more regularly attend their appointments. The preferred delivery of such a program was onsite (hospital or cancer centre) (13/20, 65%), followed by in-home (seven of 20, 35%). Narrative analysis noted themes of increased stress and childcare responsibilities associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic and reduction of childcare resources and support. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that childcare issues are broadly impactful for parents battling cancer. The lack of supportive childcare negatively impacts the emotional psychological well-being of patients and their children, as well as impacts system efficiency and treatment compliance. Survey accrual is continuing and complete findings will aid in defining the childcare needs and perspectives of parents with cancer, as well as highlight potential solutions to support these individuals.","output":"Illuminating the Gap: Defining Childcare Needs for Cancer Patients and Their Families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation gap between national plans and successful implementation is a central theme in addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

OBJECTIVE - To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. DESIGN - Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. RESULTS - A total of 4,125 qualitative results were received from 1,110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all three samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other two samples.

While preliminary in nature, the results of this data collection campaign show that people actively changing their behaviors (using less public transport or cycling more) assessed the soundscapes as less vibrant/exciting. People who were more concerned about the pandemic tended to notice more natural sounds and noise from traffic on nearby local roads. This same subset also put a bigger importance on the environmental quality of the public space than in the pre-pandemic period. Noise sensitivity also played a role, as an association was found between more-than-average noise sensitive persons and those more worried regarding the pandemic.

How to operationalize resilience and to determine the factors and processes that lead to good long-term mental health outcomes in stressor-exposed individuals is a matter of ongoing debate and of critical importance for the advancement of the field. One of the biggest challenges for implementing an outcome-based definition of resilience in longitudinal observational study designs lies in the fact that real-life adversity is usually unpredictable and that its substantial qualitative as well as temporal variability between subjects often precludes defining circumscribed time windows of inter-individually comparable stressor exposure relative to which the maintenance or recovery of mental health can be determined. To address this pertinent issue, we propose to frequently and regularly monitor stressor exposure (E) and mental health problems (P) throughout a study's observation period [Frequent Stressor and Mental Health Monitoring (FRESHMO)-paradigm]. On this basis, a subject's deviation at any single monitoring time point from the study sample's normative ECP relationship (the regression residual) can be used to calculate that subject's current mental health reactivity to stressor exposure (stressor reactivity, SR). The SR score takes into account the individual extent of experienced adversity and is comparable between and within subjects. Individual SR time courses across monitoring time points reflect intra-individual temporal variability in SR, where periods of under-reactivity (negative SR score) are associated with accumulation of fewer mental health problems than is normal for the sample. If FRESHMO is accompanied by regular measurement of potential resilience factors, temporal changes in resilience factors can be used to predict SR time courses. An increase in a resilience factor measurement explaining a lagged decrease in SR can then be considered to index a process of adaptation to stressor exposure that promotes a resilient outcome (an allostatic resilience process). This design principle allows resilience research to move beyond merely determining baseline predictors of resilience outcomes, which cannot inform about how individuals successfully adjust and adapt when confronted with adversity. Hence, FRESHMO plus regular resilience factor monitoring incorporates a dynamic-systems perspective into resilience research.","output":"The Frequent Stressor and Mental Health Monitoring-Paradigm: A Proposal for the Operationalization and Measurement of Resilience and the Identification of Resilience Processes in Longitudinal Observational Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has affected the utilisation of emergency department (ED) services worldwide.

Methods: In this single center, retrospective case-control study, we included all COVID-19 inpatients transferred or admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January 3 to March 30 2020 who had definite clinical outcomes (cured or deceased) with complete laboratory and radiological results. Clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical records, and compared between the cured and deceased patients. ROC curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the clinical parameters, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for mortality. The correlation between the variables was evaluated by Spearman correlation analysis. Results: 208 patients were included in this study, 182 patients were cured and discharged, 26 patients died from COVID-2019. Most patients had comorbidities, with hypertension as the most common chronic disease (80; 38%). The most common symptoms at onset were fever (149; 72%), cough (137; 66%), and dyspnea (113; 54%). Elevated leucocytes, neutrophils, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, ferritin, IL6, IL8, procalcitonin), PT, D-dimer, myocardial enzymes, BUN, decreased lymphocyte and subsets (T cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, T cells + B cells + NK cells), and immunological factors (C3, C4) indicated poor outcome. PT, C3, and T cells were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for mortality by logistic regression models. IL6 and CPR were positively correlated with neutrophils, but negatively with lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets except B cells. IL8 and ferritin were negatively related to T cells and CD4 T cells. Positive associations existed between C3 and T cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells, whereas there was no significant correlation between C4 and lymphocyte subsets.

Telemedicine has already been used for well-controlled patients with rheumatic diseases with good results in terms of safety and disease activity compared to conventional face-to-face visits. Telemedicine represents an interesting tool for appointment prioritization and triaging, while automated algorithm-based applications are currently too imprecise for routine clinical use. The role of smartphone applications in the care of patients with rheumatic diseases is still unclear. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine represents an interesting option for certain patient populations with rheumatic diseases. Apart from research on the effectiveness and safety of telemedical interventions, decision makers need to set clear rules on how telemedicine should be used to provide the best possible care for the individual patient.","output":"Telemedizinische Betreuung und IT-gesttzte Verfahren in der Rheumatologie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has engendered changes in previously unimaginable timeframes, leading to new ways of working, which can quickly become the ordinary way of working Many traditional workplace and educational practices and environments, however, are disadvantageous to people with disability and consequently are under-represented in the workforce and higher education Design/methodology/approach: Contributing factors include exclusionary societal and employer attitudes and inaccessible built environments including lack of attention to paths of travel, amenities, acoustics, lighting and temperature Social exclusion resulting from lack of access to meaningful work is also problematic COVID-19 has accelerated the incidence of working and studying from home, but the home environment of many people with disability may not be suitable in terms of space, privacy, technology access and connection to the wider community Findings: However, remote and flexible working arrangements may hold opportunities for enhancing work participation of people with disabilities Instigating systemic conditions that will empower people with disability to take full advantage of ordinary working trajectories is key As the current global experiment in modified work and study practices has shown, structural, organisational and design norms need to change The future of work and study is almost certainly more work and study from home An expanded understanding of people with disabilities lived experience of the built environment encompassing opportunities for work, study and socialisation from home and the neighbourhood would more closely align with the UNCRPD's emphasis on full citizenship Originality/value: This paper examines what is currently missing in the development of a distributed work and study place continuum that includes traditional workplaces and campuses, local neighbourhood hubs and homes ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Beyond the pandemic: the role of the built environment in supporting people with disabilities work life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I and III interferons (IFN-I/{lambda}) are key antiviral mediators against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In turn, the pDCs restrict viral spread by a local IFN-I/{lambda} response directed toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This specialized function enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely by a concentrated flux of antiviral effectors at the contact site with infected cells. Therefore, we propose that pDC activation is essential to locally control SARS-CoV-2-infection. By exploring the pDC response in patients, we further demonstrate that pDC responsiveness correlates with the severity of the disease and in particular that it is impaired in severe COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and feasibility of the Nvision VLE system. DESIGN Prospective, multicenter study. SETTING Tertiary-care medical centers. PATIENTS One hundred patients with suspected Barrett's esophagus, including 52 patients with prior endotherapy. INTERVENTIONS The first-generation Nvision VLE Imaging System, a balloon-centered, rotating optical probe provided images of the mucosa and submucosa through a 6-cm segment length and 360 scan of the distal esophagus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Acquisition of a complete, 6-cm scan from the distal esophagus, demographic and procedural data, and final histologic diagnosis. RESULTS VLE imaging was successfully performed in 87 cases. After VLE imaging, biopsy specimens were obtained in 77 patients and mucosal resection was performed in 20 patients. The final pathologic diagnoses of the patients studied were adenocarcinoma (4 patients), high-grade dysplasia (10 patients), low-grade dysplasia (11 patients), indefinite (5 patients), intestinal metaplasia (29 patients), and normal squamous cells (18 patients). VLE was not completed in 13 of 100 (13%) because of optical probe and console issues. There were 2 minor adverse events (mucosal lacerations not requiring therapy). LIMITATIONS This was a feasibility study with a first-generation device. There was no direct histopathologic correlation with the VLE images or any comparative analysis with white-light endoscopy or narrow-band imaging findings.

METHODS We compared the accuracy and precision of a non-invasive cardiac output (NICO) monitor and of thermodilution with those of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to measure CO in 50 patients who underwent elective valvoplasty to treat TR (26 mild and 24 moderate-to-severe) and in 25 normal controls (without TR). We used TEE as a reference method to measure CO and to intraoperatively grade TR. RESULTS The differences between NICO monitor and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.17 +/- 0.88 (n = 150, r (2) = 0.75), -0.16 +/- 0.82 (n = 158, r (2) = 0.78), and 0.17 +/- 0.91 L/min (n = 155, r (2) = 0.78), respectively. The differences between bolus thermodilution cardiac output and TEE measurements in patients without TR and in those with mild and with moderate-to-severe TR were -0.08 +/- 0.55 (r (2) = 0.88), 0.05 +/- 0.61 (r (2) = 0.86), and 0.43 +/- 1.37 L/min (r (2) = 0.58), respectively. CONCLUSION These findings demonstrate that measuring CO using the thermodilution technique is less accurate in patients with moderate-to-severe TR and that the NICO monitor is more accurate for such patients.

PURPOSE This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate TempWatch's impact on weight gain, amount of KMC received, and length of hospital stay for LBW infants as compared to standard care. METHODS Otherwise healthy LBW infants (with birthweights 1500-2300 g) admitted to a KMC ward of a government hospital in New Delhi, India were randomly allocated to a TempWatch group or a control group and wore the device until their time of discharge. 50 infants were enrolled in each group. All participants received standard-of-care temperature monitoring, and those in the control group were monitored using the hand-touch method. Each group also received sixth-hourly temperature monitoring. Infants' daily weight and the number of hypothermia episodes they experienced per day were recorded, and mothers of infants in both groups completed daily KMC diaries. RESULTS The TempWatch group experienced statistically significant weight gain as compared to the control group (0.06 vs. 0.02 kg, p = .024).

U.S. states and territories began implementing various community mitigation policies in March 2020. One widely implemented strategy was the issuance of orders requiring persons to stay home, resulting in decreased population movement in some jurisdictions (3). Each state or territory has authority to enact its own laws and policies to protect the public's health, and jurisdictions varied widely in the type and timing of orders issued related to stay-at-home requirements. To identify the broader impact of these stay-at-home orders, using publicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices, CDC and the Georgia Tech Research Institute analyzed changes in population movement relative to stay-at-home orders issued during March 1-May 31, 2020, by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.* During this period, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders.

Robust humoral anti-viral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also functions as an ectoenzyme that converts AMP into adenosine, which can be immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized Fc{gamma}R binding-deficient IgG1 anti-CD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73+ B cells, inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006 may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose, dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19.

RESULTS: Salivary IgG antibody responses in Cohort 1 (mainly mild COVID-19) were detectable up to nine months post-recovery, with high correlations between spike and nucleocapsid specificity. At nine months, IgG remained in both blood and saliva in majority of patients. Salivary IgA was rarely detected at this timepoint. In Cohort 2, salivary IgG and IgA responses were significantly associated with a recent history of COVID-19 like symptoms. Salivary IgG also tolerated temperature and detergent pre-treatments.

In the current work, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-LAMP assays were performed on extracted RNA of seven wastewater samples from COVID-19 hotspots. RT?LAMP assay was also performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction. Current detection of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly by RT-qPCR of ORF (ORF1ab) and N genes so we targeted both to find the best target gene for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We also performed RT-LAMP with/without RNA extraction inside microfluidic device to target both genes. Positivity rates of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP performed on extracted RNA were 100.0% (7/7) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively. RT-qPCR results revealed that all 7 wastewater samples were positive for N gene (Ct range 37C39), and negative for ORF1ab, suggesting that N gene could be the best target gene for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RT-LAMP of N and ORF (ORF1a) genes performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction indicated that all 7 samples remains pink (negative). The color remains pink in all microchannels except microchannels which subjected to RT-LAMP for targeting N region after RNA extraction (yellow color) in 6 out of 7 samples. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 was successfully detected from wastewater samples using RT-LAMP in microfluidic chips. This study brings the novelty involving the use of wastewater samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 without previous virus concentration and with/without RNA extraction.

Performed ex vivo, cell fusion is a versatile research and therapeutic tool for gene mapping, antibody production, discovering new mechanisms in biological processes, inventing alternative therapies for cell reprogramming, restoring organ function, and creating cellular therapeutics for cancer treatment. Cell fusion can be successfully applied by creating cellular therapeutic of donor C recipient chimeric cell (DRCC) in the field of solid organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). Immunomodulatory DRCC therapy has the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for toxic, life-long immunosuppression and to prevent both acute and chronic rejection. This innovative VCA treatment is a combination of ex vivo created chimeric cell therapy with a short-term selective protocol of monoclonal antibody and Cyclosporine A. The utilization of short-term immunosuppressive protocol will provide the opportunity for chimeric cell engraftment, proliferation, and re-education of recipients immune system resulting in prolongation of allograft survival. The use of chimeric cells, as a supportive treatment for VCA, would improve the conditions of severely disfigured patients by offering safe alternative approach and providing better functional and aesthetic results compared to standard reconstructive procedures. This chapter summarizes the phenomenon, current discoveries, and advancements in the field of cell fusion, as well as introduces ex vivo creation of chimeric cells and presents potential benefits of chimeric cell-based protocols. Successful application of chimeric cell protocol in VCA experimental models will advance the field of reconstructive transplantation towards clinical trials.","output":"Cellular Therapy Models: Ex Vivo Chimera Model by Cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Antecedentes y objetivo: La actual pandemia de Covid-19 ha puesto a los profesionales sanitarios de todo el mundo ante un desafo sin precedentes.

Abstract Background and objectives: The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods: A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results: A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (R2 = 0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the tens of ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be pre-designed for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.","output":"Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Aim was to study the early impact of acuity circle-based allocation implementation system, on liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

RESULTS Total OLTs reduced from 6699 in the pre-acuity circle era to 6660 in the post-acuity circle era (-0.6%); this decrease is mostly driven by a decrease in HCC transplants (1529 to 1351; -11.6%). Six out of 11 regions had a reduction in the absolute number and percentage of HCC transplants with significant reductions in regions 2 (-37.8%, p<0.001) and 4 (-28.3%, p = 0.001). DISCUSSION The introduction of median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) at transplant minus 3 (MMaT-3) exception points, has created differential opportunities for HCC patients, in low-MELD as opposed to high-MELD areas, despite having the same disease.

The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds.

It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.","output":"44 Asthma in the Preschool Age Child"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIGNIFICANCE Quantitative measurement of blood oxygen saturation (sO2) with optoacoustic (OA) imaging is one of the most sought after goals of quantitative OA imaging research due to its wide range of biomedical applications.

However, coronary heart disease remains, by far, the most common disease in developed countries, and the progressive ageing of population leads to a constantly increasing prevalence of chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). The consequence is an unsustainable demand for access to collapsing hospital clinic and doctors office. The dramatic Covid-19 era has become the testing ground for alternative ways to deliver healthcare avoiding in-hospital contacts, thus affirming the validity of telemedicine as a key tool to improve the patient journey. In our centre, video consults have been integrated to CCS patients clinical care pathway, not only preventing the risk of contagion but also laying the groundwork for a paradigm shift in clinical care course. METHODS AND RESULTS: Since pandemic outbreak, Lazio Region offered to its inhabitants free of charge teleconsulting for both primary care and specialist referral. At the cardiovascular department of Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS, this opportunity has been recently applied to optimize the chronic coronary syndrome patient journey. Specifically, videoconsulting has been used in different steps of CCS clinical course, replacing both in-person first visit and follow-up consultation after percutaneous myocardial revascularization. Being CCS a context in which the therapy optimization or the transition to higher level tests are mainly indicated by symptoms, these remote consultations could work as well as in-hospital visits to assess risk stratification and to consequently arrange the best therapeuticCdiagnostic pathway. Besides, as COVID-19 pandemic caused significant delays, further remote visits have addressed the need to keep in contact with patients waiting for coronary angiography and to reassess their urgency criteria. In our department, over last 9 months, 141 patients have been examined and followed-up through teleconsulting, amounting to 34.1% of all supplied visits. Despite a high median age (67  19.7 years), the drop-out rate of the contacted patients due to inability or denial was quite low (7.5%) and this high adherence to videoconsulting suggests time is ripe for a full telemedicine employment in clinical care course. In the cohort of patients waiting for coronary angiography, a telemedical reassessment led to a significant rate of priority class switch (42.7%), probably preventing adverse cardiac events in those individuals with worsening symptoms (systematically evaluated using Seattle Angina Questionnaire). Of note, the implementation of this parallel virtual pathway for these patients allowed us to decrease the waiting times for in-person visits at our CCS clinic, with an estimated time reduction of almost 3 months. This result supports our idea that the adoption of a remote pathway for chronic illness management, like CCS, may provide more opportunities for treatment of severe cases at in-person clinics that are often overcrowded. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, all the potential of telehealth to empower primary and specialty health care is gradually emerging, and CCS seems the perfect setting for an integrated physical and virtual health system.","output":"793 A single-centre experience with telemedicine-integrated chronic coronary syndrome care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Networked music is no longer a future genre: the global quarantine event of 2020 launched the concept of performing together over the Internet into the mainstream.

Methods: In this case-control study, patients with severe COVID-19 in this newly established isolation center on admission between 27 January 2020 to 19 March 2020 were divided to discharge group and death event group. Clinical information was collected and analyzed for the following objectives: 1. Comparisons of basic characteristics between two groups; 2.

Results: 124 patients with severe COVID-19 on admission were included and divided into discharge group (n=35) and death event group (n=89). Sex, SpO2, breath rate, diastolic pressure, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer were significantly correlated with death events identified using bivariate logistic regression.

The global pandemic began in 2019. It has changed the lives of people with learning disabilities. We began our project during the first lockdown in April 2020. We came together to set up a website to collect stories and support and learn from each other about how to survive and keep strong. Storytelling is very important because it helps us understand what is going on. It is also a way to capture the history of people with learning disabilities at a very difficult time. We know that thousands of people with learning disabilities became ill and died in the flu epidemic of 1918. But nobody recorded their stories in their own words. We want to make sure this does not happen again, so we created an archive to help us remember. METHODS: The project was managed with an advisory group of people with and without learning disabilities who met monthly to monitor the collection and analysis of stories on the site. A site audit was performed regularly to determine the themes in the stories and who had submitted. The article describes the progress of the project, the stories we have shared, and the challenges we have faced. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss how people with learning disabilities have been presented in the media and our views about the way we are not heard, or always shown as vulnerable victims. We have found many sad stories, but also positive ones about people being creative and supportive. We look forward to the future and share our ideas about how society could be different and more inclusive.

These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, SARS-CoV-2 and the functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.","output":"Evaluation of diversity levels in HIV-1 virus integrase gene sequences, supporting the lack of target specificity of ivermectin versus the integrase-importin complex in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research is focused on the subject of boredom in the families during the stay-at-home process forced by coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic The literature on boredom was reviewed, and then the qualitative research was designed with the open-ended questions appropriate for the subject and purpose The research was conducted between April 20 and 29, 2020, in Istanbul, Turkey, with the participation of 264 families The most significant findings of the research showed that family members accustomed to active life experienced boredom more during the stay-at-home process, they utilized information technologies very often to overcome boredom, the importance of time spent at home increased, involuntary behaviors such as overeating and snacking became common, the livelihood difficulties and fear of unemployment increased boredom, nevertheless, no conflict occurred between the family members, and the process taught to be patient and strong","output":"COVID-19: Boredom in the Family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proximity-Based Indoor Positioning Systems (PIPSs) are a simple to install alternative in large facilities.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine if physical fitness qualities were associated with performance of sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players. METHODS Five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest, and Scopus) were searched for relevant studies up to April 15, 2019. Full-text articles investigating relationships between physical fitness and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players were included. Methodological quality of included studies was appraised using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Data synthesis was conducted to determine the summary of evidence based on the number of significantly associated relationships divided by the total relationships assessed. An individual relationship was defined as a reported result examining the association between a single physical fitness variable and a single sport-specific technical skill. RESULTS Data synthesis of grouped female ball players from 41 included studies revealed three clear associations: (i) body composition and defensive technical skills (19/29; 66%), (ii) agility and movement with a ball (4/6; 67%), and (iii) coordination and movement with a ball (3/5; 60%). An uncertain association exists between cardiorespiratory fitness and defensive technical skills (2/5; 40%). No association or an unknown conclusion (< 5 relationships reported) exists between all remaining physical fitness attributes and sport-specific technical skills. Sub-analyses revealed clear associations between body composition and throwing/shooting (using hands) in junior ball players (15/15; 100%) and with movement with a ball in elite (6/9; 67%) and senior (6/6; 100%) ball players. Three uncertain associations were found between offensive technical skills and agility in elite ball players (3/8; 38%), and with speed in elite (6/14; 43%) and junior (7/18; 39%) female ball players. CONCLUSION There is limited evidence available to demonstrate relationships between physical fitness qualities and sport-specific technical skills in female, team-based ball players.

Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates and relative survival for years of diagnosis 2000-2007 and with trends during 1995-2007 were calculated overall, by age and by country. RESULTS: The crude annual incidence rate was 0.28 per 100,000 and age-adjusted incidence was 0.23 per 100,000; incidence increased with age, from 0.18/100,000 at age 0-44 to 0.25/100,000 at age 45-64 and 0.69/100,000 at age 65 and over. Age-adjusted incidence in males was more than four times that in females. Portugal, which had the highest incidence of AIDS in Europe, had by far the highest incidence of KS at age 0-44, 1.44/100,000, more than four times the rate in any other country. Incidence among males in Europe aged 0-44 fell significantly between 1995-1998 and 1999-2002, followed by a significant increase in 2003-2007.

Many factors are currently well-known to predispose to PA. However, during the period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, case reports of PA associated with COVID-19 infection have been sequentially published. To the best of our knowledge, four cases have been reported so far in the English literature. We herein report the fifth case of this association and review the pertinent literature. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old male patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection presented by progressive decrease in visual acuity and oculomotor nerve palsy. His medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and pituitary macroadenoma resection 11 years ago. He was on hormonal replacement therapy for panhypopituitarism that complicated the surgery. Previous magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were consistent with enlarging residual pituitary adenoma. During the current hospitalization, computed tomography revealed hyperdensity of the sellar and suprasellar areas. MR imaging revealed PA in a recurrent large adenoma. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection was uneventfully undertaken with near total excision of the adenoma and partial improvement of visual loss and oculomotor palsy. Histopathological examination demonstrated classic features of PA. However, his chest condition progressed and he had to be transferred to COVID-19 intensive care unit in the referring hospital where he was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. One week later, the patient unfortunately passed away due to complications of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: We report the fifth case of PA associated with COVID-19 infection. Based on our patients clinical findings, review of the other reported cases, as well as the available literature, we put forth a multitude of pathophysiological mechanisms induced by COVID-19 that can possibly lead to the development of PA. In our opinion, the association between both conditions is not just a mere coincidence. Although the histopathological features of PA associated with COVID-19 are similar to PA induced by other etiologies, future research may disclose unique pathological fingerprints of COVID-19 virus that explains its capability of inducing PA.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 infection and pituitary apoplexy: A causal relation or just a coincidence?

Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded. RESULTS 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively). Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the incidence of nausea was reduced in group T. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with saline.

Initial manifestations include fever, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms, which may progress to respiratory disease. There may also be neurological and psychiatric manifestations, involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. Methods We performed a literature search of the databases PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science for observational studies reporting neurological, psychiatric, and neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19. This was followed by a narrative synthesis to summarise the data and discuss neuropsychiatric associations, symptom severity, management, and recovery. Findings The most frequently reported neurological symptoms were ageusia, hyposmia/anosmia, dizziness, headache, and loss of consciousness. Statistically significant relationships were noted between Asian ethnicity and peripheral neuropathy (p=0.0001) and neuro-syndromic symptoms (p=0.001). ITU admission was found to have a statistically significant relationship with male sex (p=0.024). Depression and anxiety were also identified both during and after infection. The most frequent treatments used were intravenous immunoglobulins, followed by antibiotics, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine; with mean treatment duration of 6 days.

Although antivenoms are so-far the most effective treatment to reverse the acute systemic effects induced by snakebite envenoming, they have a limited therapeutic potential, being unable to completely neutralize the local venom effects. Local damage, such as dermonecrosis and myonecrosis, can lead to permanent sequelae with physical, social, and psychological implications. The strong inflammatory process induced by snake venoms is associated with poor tissue regeneration, in particular the lack of or reduced skeletal muscle regeneration. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapies have shown both anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative properties. We postulate that using allogeneic MSCs or their cell-free products can induce skeletal muscle regeneration in snakebite victims, improving all the three steps of the skeletal muscle regeneration process, mainly by anti-inflammatory activity, paracrine effects, neovascularization induction, and inhibition of tissue damage, instrumental for microenvironment remodeling and regeneration. Since snakebite envenoming occurs mainly in areas with poor healthcare, we enlist the principles and potential of MSCs-based therapies and discuss regulatory issues, good manufacturing practices, transportation, storage, and related-procedures that could allow the administration of these therapies, looking forward to a safe and cost-effective treatment for a so far unsolved and neglected health problem.","output":"Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Based Therapies as Promising Treatments for Muscle Regeneration After Snakebite Envenoming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute otitis media (AOM) is an inflammatory response to microbes in the middle ear, sometimes associated with rupture of the tympanic membrane.

Furthermore, the in vivo cytokine pattern was compared with that induced in leukocytes stimulated by dead bacteria in vitro. MEFs with culturable pathogenic bacteria contained more interleukin (IL)-1 (median: 110 g/L vs. <7.5 g/L), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (6.3 g/L vs. <2.5 g/L), IL-8 (410 g/L vs. 38 g/L) and IL-10 (0.48 g/L vs. <0.30 g/L) than culture-negative fluids, irrespective of PCR findings. IL-6 and PGE2 were equally abundant (69-110 g/L) in effusions with live, dead or undetectable bacteria. Cytokine levels were unrelated to bacterial species and to the presence or absence of virus. Similar levels of TNF and IL-6 as found in the MEFs were obtained by in vitro stimulation of leukocytes, whereas 11 times more IL-1 and 3.5 times more IL-8 were produced in vivo, and 22 times more IL-10 was produced in vitro.

Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a non-judgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress in regular times, and may be relevant in mitigating harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, restrictions may necessitate this training being delivered online, rather than in in-person group settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to examine the effect of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as evaluate the effectiveness of online interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Participants were recruited (with no exclusion criteria) from enrollees in mindfulness courses at a local charity organization promoting mental wellness. Three groups were created, two that received their training during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person (N = 36) and videoconferencing (N = 38)), and a second control group of participants tested before the pandemic (N = 86). Primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels, and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups using analysis of covariance and two one-sided t-tests. RESULTS: Perceived stress and sleep quality did not differ significantly between groups at baseline. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P < .001), and this effect was statistically equivalent for videoconferencing compared to in-person training (P = .002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the pre-pandemic group (P < .001), but in neither of the groups during the pandemic. Participants reported shorter times to initiate sleep following mindfulness training pre-pandemic (P < .001), but not during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the online and comparison groups (P = .02), and participants engaged in marginally more daily practice in the online condition. CONCLUSIONS: Online mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for stress reduction but not sleep improvement during times when traditional in-person training is not feasible.","output":"The effects of online group mindfulness training on stress and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore: a retrospective equivalence analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To explore Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an expression platform for dengue oral immune complex vaccine development.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of a Stay-At-Home order was associated with lower rates of motor vehicle-related injuries requiring emergency medical treatment among population sub-groups in West Virginia (i.e., males, females, 0-17, 18-25, 26-45, 46-65, 66 years old). METHODS A Stay-At-Home order was in effect in West Virginia from March 23-May 4, 2020. Counts of individuals who incurred motor-vehicle-related injuries that required emergency medical treatment were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program from January 1 thru September 6 of 2019 and 2020. Counts were obtained by week-year and by population sub-group in West Virginia. The presence of the Stay-At-Home order was binary coded by week. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the relationship between the presence of a Stay-At-Home and injury rates. 2019 population sub-group estimates were obtained from the United States Census Bureau and used as offsets in the models. Models were also adjusted for year and vehicle miles traveled by week-year. RESULTS There were 23,418 motor-vehicle related injuries during the study period. The presence of the Stay-At-Home order was associated with 44% less injuries overall [Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=0.56, 95% CI 0.48, 0.64]. Females experienced fewer injuries than males (IRR = 0.49 vs 0.63, respectively) and the number of injuries decreased with age (p-value 0.031) when comparing time periods when the Stay-At-Home was in effect compared to times when it was not. CONCLUSIONS West Virginia's Stay-At-Home order was associated with lower motor-vehicle injury rates requiring medical treatment across all population sub-groups. Most population sub-groups likely altered their travel behaviors which resulted in lower motor-vehicle injury rates. These findings may inform future policies that impose emergency travel restrictions in populations.","output":"The association between a statewide stay-at-home order and motor vehicle injury rates among population sub-groups in West Virginia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Is the coronavirus pandemic just the latest indication that there are too many of us on the planet?

There is limited research evaluating the consequence of diverting resources from patient safety initiatives to COVID-19 crisis efforts. In an attempt to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on quality of patient care, we compared rates of blood culture contamination and central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) during COVID-19 to those before the pandemic. METHODS: A comparative retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze blood culture contamination and CLABSI rate per 1,000 line days in a tertiary care hospital in Detroit within a pre- COVID-19 timeframe, January - May 2019, and COVID-19 timeframe, January - May 2020. The CLABSI rate data was obtained through Infection Control Surveillance System TheraDoc?. Blood culture contamination report was obtained through the Microbiology Department. Chi-square and t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The blood culture contamination rate increased from 3.1% during pre COVID-19 timeframe to 4.0% during COVID-19 (p-value < 0.01) (Figure 1) with the highest rate in March and April 2020 correlating with the peak of COVID-19 (Figure 2). The CLABSI rate per 1,000 line days increased from 0.71 in pre-COVID-19 time frame to 2.70 during COVID-19 (p-value < 0.01) (Figure 1). Of the 33 CLABSIs identified during the COVID-19 time frame, 18 (54%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. When comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients; average length of stay was 28.1 days shorter in the positive group (p-value < 0.01). COVID-19 positive patient had higher mortality (p-value < 0.01) (Table1).

The purpose of this study was to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was associated with laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. Methods. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and children from Canadian Hutterite communities were followed prospectively during the respiratory virus season. Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained if symptoms developed and infections were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction. The association between serum 25(OH)D and time to laboratory-confirmed viral RTI was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results. Seven hundred forty-three children aged 3C15 years were followed between 22 December 2008 and 23 June 2009. The median serum 25(OH)D level was 62.0 nmol/L (interquartile range, 51.0C74.0). A total of 229 participants (31%) developed at least 1 laboratory-confirmed viral RTI. Younger age and lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of viral RTI.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted using a questionnaire comprised of six closed-ended questions to identify potential risk factors for severe COVID-19. Using COVID-19 associated illnesses and complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure, cardiac failure, and thromboembolic events), we derived an index variable to measure the severity of COVID-19 in patients. RESULTS: We included 143 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 of whom 62.2% (n = 89) were male and 37.8% (n = 54) were female. The average age of the cohort was 50.616.5 years. Our study found that being a female, working at the health care facility, being a healthcare worker, attending a mass gathering within the last 14 days, attending a gathering with 10 persons or less, and being admitted to a hospital were associated with increased risk of developing severe COVID-19.

This may lead to differences precluding cost utility analyses comparisons. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of cost utility analyses conducted in critical care. Our objectives were to understand: 1) methodologic characteristics, 2) how health-related quality-of-life was measured/reported, and 3) what costs were reported/measured. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES We systematically searched for cost utility analyses in critical care in MEDLINE, Embase, American College of Physicians Journal Club, CENTRAL, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews' selected subset of archived versions of UK National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and American Economic Association electronic databases from inception to April 30, 2020.

The time horizon most commonly reported was lifetime (59%). For health utility reporting, health-related quality-of-life was infrequently measured (29% reported), with only 5% of studies reporting baseline health-related quality-of-life. Indirect utility measures (generic, preference-based health utility measurement tools) were reported in 85% of studies (majority Euro-quality-of-life-5 Domains, 52%). Methods of estimating health-related quality-of-life were seldom used when the patient was incapacitated: imputation (19%), assigning fixed utilities for incapacitation (19%), and surrogates reporting on behalf of incapacitated patients (5%).

However, difficulty in eliminating the risk of disease transmission, radiation exposure and not being costeffective are some of the challenges for CT and CXR imaging. This fact induces the implementation of lung ultrasound (LUS) for evaluating COVID-19 due to its practical advantages of noninvasiveness, repeatability, and sensitive bedside property.

They are essential for the European Unions (EU) health information system as providers of health information and data. The aim of this mapping exercise was to identify and analyze EU research networks in terms of health data collection methods, quality assessment, availability and accessibility procedures. METHODS: A web-based search was performed to identify EU research networks that are not part of international organizations (e.g., WHO-Europe, OECD) and are involved in collection of data for health monitoring or health system performance assessment. General characteristics of the research networks (e.g., data sources, representativeness), quality assessment procedures, availability and accessibility of health data were collected through an ad hoc extraction form. RESULTS: Fifty-seven research networks, representative at national, international or regional level, were identified. In these networks, data are mainly collected through administrative sources, health surveys and cohort studies. Over 70% of networks provide information on quality assessment of their data collection procedures. Most networks share macrodata through articles and reports, while microdata are available from ten networks. A request for data access is required by 14 networks, of which three apply a financial charge. Few networks share data with other research networks (8/49) or specify the metadata-reporting standards used for data description (9/49). CONCLUSIONS: Improving health information and availability of high quality data is a priority in Europe. Research networks could play a major role in tackling health data and information inequalities by enhancing quality, availability, and accessibility of health data and data sharing across European networks.

We sought to examine cancer care providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the care for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages through social media. RESULTS: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4% had access to written guidelines that specifically address the management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status. Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-, healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3%) that decision making about Do Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays, healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for family and self.

No study has yet examined the presence of psychiatric symptoms in the UK population in similar conditions.AimsWe investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 related anxiety, generalised anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms in a representative sample of the UK population during an early phase of the pandemic, and estimated associations with variables likely to influence these symptoms.MethodBetween March 23rd and March 28th 2020, a quota sample of 2025 UK adults 18 years and older, stratified by age, sex and household income, was recruited by online survey company Qualtrics. Participants completed measures of depression (PHQ9), generalised anxiety (GAD7), and trauma symptoms relating to the pandemic (ITQ). Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for age, gender, rural vs urban environment, presence of children in the household, income, loss of income, pre-existing health conditions in self and someone close, infection in self and someone close, and perceived risk of infection over the next month.ResultsHigher levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms were reported compared to previous population studies, but not dramatically so. Meeting the criteria for either anxiety or depression, and trauma symptoms was predicted by young age, presence of children in the home, and high estimates of personal risk. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also predicted by low income, loss of income, and pre-existing health conditions in self and other. Specific anxiety about COVID-19 was greater in older participants.Conclusions The UK population, especially older citizens, were largely resilient in the early stages of the pandemic. However, several specific COVID-related variables are associated with psychological distress: particularly having children at home, loss of income because of the pandemic, as well as having a pre-existing health condition, exposure to the virus and high estimates of personal risk.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a modified PEI method combined with MWA for the treatment of symptomatic, predominantly cystic and benign thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 201 patients who underwent treatment in our department between April 2015 and August 2018. Predominantly cystic thyroid nodules were treated by the modified PEI procedure, which included short-term boiling ethanol ablation (STBEA) and was combined with MWA. Complications, the volume reduction ratio (VRR), symptoms and cosmetic scores were recorded at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter. RESULTS No major complications were observed during or after the treatment. Ten patients (4.8%) experienced temporary voice change, which resolved within 3 months. Of 200 (97.6%) out of 205 nodules showed significant volume reduction at the final follow-up. Recurrence occurred for only 5 (2.4%) nodules. The mean thyroid nodule volume decreased from 17.40  3.21 mL at baseline to 1.17  0.37 mL at 12 months. The greatest VRR was observed within the first 3 months after treatment.

We hypothesized that the Ichikado CT score, obtained in the first 24 h of hospital admission, is an independent predictor for all-cause mortality during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at our institution between March 20th, 2020 and October 31st, 2020. Patients were enrolled if, within 24 h of admission, a chest CT scan, an arterial blood gas, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel were performed. Two independent radiologists, who were blinded to clinical data, retrospectively evaluated the chest CT scans following a previously described qualitative and quantitative CT scoring system. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality or survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were new requirements for invasive mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay. Cox regression models were used to test the association between potential independent predictors and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients, 197 survivors and 38 nonsurvivors, were studied. The median Ichikado CT score for nonsurvivors was significantly higher than survivors (P < 0.001). An Ichikado CT score of more than 172 enabled prediction of mortality, with a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 79.7%. Multivariate analysis identified Ichikado CT score (HR, 7.772; 95% CI, 3.164C19.095; P < 0.001), together with age (HR, 1.030; 95% CI, 1.030C1.060; P = 0.043), as independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Ichikado CT score is an independent predictor of both requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Further prospective evaluation is necessary to confirm these findings.

We aim to fill this research gap and annotate a corpus of 1200 tweets for implicit and explicit biomedical claims (the latter also with span annotations for the claim phrase). With this corpus, which we sample to be related to COVID-19, measles, cystic fibrosis, and depression, we develop baseline models which detect tweets that contain a claim automatically. Our analyses reveal that biomedical tweets are densely populated with claims (45 % in a corpus sampled to contain 1200 tweets focused on the domains mentioned above).

The present study was conducted in Tehran, the political and economic capital of Iran, to determine the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and identify its associated factors, and explain the most important barriers and acceptance strategies for vaccination. This research was a concurrent quantitative and qualitative mixed-method study. In the quantitative part, 1200 individuals aged more than 18 years were selected from the households in 22 districts of Tehran City, with a multistage stratified cluster sampling method. Two questionnaires were used to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine acceptance determinants. The qualitative content analysis method addressed the influencing factors, as well as challenges and strategies related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine in four groups of Tehran inhabitants: the elderly, people with underlying diseases, healthcare workers, and the general population. The related data were simultaneously collected by applying in-depth semi-structural interviews and a data analysis process. Furthermore, we used the Graneheim and Lundman method for data analysis. We analyzed the data of 1200 people with a mean (SD) age of 46.4 (11.1) years, and approximately 58% of them were men. The vaccine acceptance was 83.6% (95% CI: 81.3C85.9). Among those who welcomed vaccination, 58% preferred the imported vaccines, 25% the Iranian ones, and 17% both. There was a significant association between the variables of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.01C2.93), being single (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41C0.91), moderate pharmacotherapy adherence (AOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.4C0.85), and the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Qualitative study after interviewing 45 people from four study groups showed an insufficient social trust in healthcare system officials, pharmaceutical and vaccine production companies; distrust in the effectiveness of the vaccines, concerns about the vaccine adverse effects, being tracked by microchips after vaccination, traditional anti-vaccination movements, the feeling the inessentiality of vaccination, and uncertainty about the fair distribution of the vaccine. These concerns were the main challenges addressed by the study groups. A good proportion of Tehran residents reported their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, they expressed their critical concerns, such as insufficient trust in the healthcare system, vaccine safeties, and adverse effects that were the significant barriers to vaccine acceptance. It seems that conflicts raised by the shortage of vaccines and their import due to the sanctions have led to intense desire and demand in the general population, and especially the elderly, for vaccination. Besides, vaccination phobia in some individuals requires further investigations.","output":"The Barriers, Challenges, and Strategies of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Vaccine Acceptance: A Concurrent Mixed-Method Study in Tehran City, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is treated with anticoagulation therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), angioplasty, and liver transplantation. TIPS is not always technically feasible, due to the complete hepatic venous thrombosis. Direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) is an alternative method for decompression of portal hypertension. This is a retrospective, single-center study aiming to evaluate the outcome of ultrasound (US)-guided DIPS in patients with BCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2016, six patients with BCS were treated with US-guided DIPS. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents were used in two patients and bare-metal stents in four patients. Mean follow-up time was 71.4 months (range: 21-164). Technical/clinical success, technical difficulties, and complications of DIPS were analyzed. RESULTS Technical success without complications was achieved in all patients (100%). In one patient, DIPS was performed through the right femoral vein, without significant amelioration of portal hypertension (clinical success 83.3%). In four out of five patients, ascites and variceal bleeding resolved completely and in the other one ascites was relieved. Six- and 12-month primary patency rates were 100% in PTFE-covered stent group when compared with bare-metal stent group, the rates were 33% and 0%, respectively.

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death globally and over 8% of global TB cases are estimated to be attributable to AUD. Social determinants of health such as poverty and undernutrition are often shared among those with AUD and TB and could explain the epidemiologic association between them. However, recent studies suggest that these shared risk factors do not fully account for the increased risk of TB in people with AUD. In fact, AUD has been shown to be an independent risk factor for TB, with a linear increase in the risk for TB with increasing alcohol consumption. While few studies have focused on potential biological mechanisms underlying the link between AUD and TB, substantial overlap exists between the effects of alcohol on lung immunity and the mechanisms exploited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to establish infection. Alcohol misuse impairs the immune functions of the alveolar macrophage, the resident innate immune effector in the lung and the first line of defense against Mtb in the lower respiratory tract. Chronic alcohol ingestion also increases oxidative stress in the alveolar space, which could in turn facilitate Mtb growth. In this manuscript, we review the epidemiologic data that links AUD to TB. We discuss the existing literature on the potential mechanisms by which alcohol increases the risk of TB and review the known effects of alcohol ingestion on lung immunity to elucidate other mechanisms that Mtb may exploit.

Our study was conducted prospectively to develop strategies for non-invasive ventilation in combination with timed position change of patients to see its impact on their outcome. OBJECTIVES: Non-invasive ventilation has proven to be of benefit in COVID-19 related acute lung injury. The objective of this prospective, cross sectional study was to develop a protocol for the use of non-invasive ventilation with timed position change to improve COVID-19 patients outcomes in the Emergency Department (ED). METHODS: All patients presenting with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were enrolled in the study from March 2020 to October 2020. Data was collected to see the effect of timed position change and non-invasive ventilation on these patients and its effect on delaying or avoiding invasive ventilation. RESULTS: Of the 207 COVID-19 patients presenting to the IHHN ED, 109(52.7%) had oxygen saturation in the nineties in supine position followed by right lateral in 37(17.9%), sitting up in 30(14.5%), left lateral in 29(14%) and prone position in 2(1%). Maximal oxygenation was achieved with non rebreather mask (NRM) and nasal prongs in 87(42%) of the patients, followed by the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in 29(14%). CONCLUSION: Most of the patients preferred to stay in the supine position and described it as the position of comfort. When used in combination supine position, patients on NRM with nasal prongs and on CPAP, had oxygen saturation in the nineties.

Though one case was admitted prior to initiation of universal testing, routine infection-control protocols limited exposure to personnel and prevented transmission to staff. In May 2020, we implemented the use of N95 mask and eye protection during all aerosolizing procedures, N95 mask use in all ORs, and universal surgical mask use in all rooms regardless of COVID-19 status. An in-house risk-stratification system was used to screen patients based on symptoms and exposure. Burn-center admissions were screened at a lower threshold than throughout the institution given the unique nature of burn injury. Eventually, because of increasing community spread, all admissions to the hospital were universally screened with RT-PCR prior to admission. To minimize exposure to non-COVID patients and Burn Center staff, COVID-19 positive burn admissions were assessed on a case-by-case basis. High acuity patients were admitted to the Burn Center and followed by the COVID consult team. Lower acuity patients were admitted to the Burn Center but were treated on the medical COVID unit and followed by the burn consult service. Conclusions The COVID 19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems worldwide. Development and implementation of universal screening, testing, infection-control precautions, and triage strategies are critical elements of burn care during the COVID-19 pandemic. As we prepare for future surges due to more transmissible variants, implementation of standard protocols enables continued provision of quality care, preservation of the healthcare workforce, and efficient use of resources.","output":"Constant evolution: Early experiences treating COVID-19 in a burn center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is now a serious public health problem. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) recognized as the receptor of SARS-CoV is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2. However, the impact of ACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the situation of malignant tumor patients in this outbreak are unclear. So, it is important to understand the expressions of ACE2 in different normal tissues and cancers. The results showed that the kidneys, duodenum, intestine, gallbladder and testis had the highest ACE2 expressions, followed by the colon, rectum and seminal vesicles. The lungs had a very low expression. ACE2 expressions were upregulated in renal cancer, gastrointestinal tumor and lung cancer. ACE2 expression levels may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity. A total of 3,421 cases with COVID-19 have been collected. Among them, 43 cases (1.26%) had malignant tumor coexisting conditions. The rate of severe events for malignant tumor patients was 39.02% (16/41), while the rate of severe events for all patients was 10.79% (194/1,798). The clinical symptoms and signs were studied for the following three systems: respiratory (31C92%), digestive (10C13%) and urinary systems (3.38%). It seems that symptom severity is not related to protein expression levels. This might be the reason for SARS-CoV-2 showing higher regeneration index and susceptibility.

We included studies conducted during January to October 2020, prior to routine vaccination against COVID-19. Since we expected the relationship between the asymptomatic proportion and age to be non-linear, multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression (QR decomposition) with a restricted cubic spline was used to model asymptomatic proportions as a function of age.

The overall estimate of the proportion of people who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remained asymptomatic throughout infection was 44.1% (6556/14850, 95%CI 43.3%-45.0%). The asymptomatic proportion peaked in adolescents (36.2%, 95%CI 26.0%-46.5%) at 13.5 years, gradually decreased by age and was lowest at 90.5 years of age (8.1%, 95%CI 3.4%-12.7%).

Objective To describe our experience and patient outcomes of almost 3,000 patients who received MAB infusion therapy at Northwell Health, a large integrated health care system in New York. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a descriptive study of adult patients, who received MAB therapy between November 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021, and a retrospective cohort survival analysis comparing patients who received MAB therapy prior to admission versus those who did not. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; additional evaluations included ED utilization and hospitalization within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test for patients who received MAB therapy. Results During the study period, 2818 (1412 [50.1%]) male, (1406 [49.9%] female) adult patients median age 67 years (IQR 58-74) with symptomatic COVID-19 received MAB infusion. Following therapy and within 28 days of COVID-19 test, 145 patients (5.1%) were hospitalized and compared with 200 controls who were eligible for but did not receive MAB therapy, and were hospitalized. In the MAB group, 16 (11%) patients met the primary outcome, versus 21 (10.5%) in the control group (not significant, log rank p-value = 0.41). In an unadjusted proportional hazards model, no significant association was found between pre-hospitalization MAB use and time to the primary end point (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.696-2.719) as well as in models adjusting for demographics (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.53-2.23), demographics and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.573-2.59), and with inverse probability weighting according to propensity scores (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.619-2.29). Reduced hospitalization rate was related to the time between symptom onset and MAB therapy (4.4% within 0-4 days, 5% within 5-7 days, and 6.1% within []8 days) however, this finding did not reach statistical significance (p-value = 0.15).

The cohort included patients aged 18 years who were hospitalized for their first stroke event between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013. Adjuvant TCM therapy was defined as additional treatments with TCM, which included acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and Tuina, during hospitalization for up to six months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The mortality rate was measured through to December 31, 2014. RESULTS: Of 321,157 patients with stroke, 14,579 received adjuvant TCM therapy. Propensity score matching resulted in 13,918 matched pairs of patients who did and did not receive adjuvant TCM care. Both multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.69) and propensity score-matching analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.66) revealed a reduced mortality risk associated with the use of adjuvant TCM therapy, as compared with routine inpatient care only. Acupuncture was the most commonly used TCM therapy. Patients treated with acupuncture only, which accounted for 41.3% of TCM users, had a reduced risk of mortality compared with those treated with routine inpatient care.

The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05).

After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of high-resolution contrast enhanced 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography using new generation 3 T imaging technology to provide detailed visualization of CN VI anatomy, particularly within the cavernous sinus and petroclival regions. METHODS: Two neuroradiologists conducted bilateral evaluation of CN VI visibility in 23 patients for nerve segments located in the petroclival segment (dural cave and Dorello's canal), and three divisions of the cavernous sinus. All images were collected using contrast enhanced TOF MR angiography using a new generation 3 T machine. RESULTS: Of the CN VI segments assessed, average visibility of CN VI was best achieved in Dorello's canal. Overall visibility of CN VI within the regions inspected was best achieved in the axial view, with the exception of the dural cave, which was best assessed using the coronal view. We also identified strong agreement in assessment of nerve visibility between the two reviewers. We also identified a putative CN6 duplication and a small schwannoma, highlighting the fidelity of our approach. CONCLUSION: Contrast enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography can visualize CN VI anatomy, particularly within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus with simultaneous visualization of arterial and venous structures. This cannot be easily achieved using traditional MRI techniques.

Our objective is to report our practice implementation and experience of COVID- 19 recovery during the resumption of routine imaging at a tertiary academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines for this practice implementation. Recover Wisely focused on a data driven, strategic rescheduling and redesigning patient flow process. We used scheduling simulations and meticulous monitoring and control of outpatient medical imaging volumes to achieve a linear restoration to our pre-COVID imaging studies. We had a tiered plan to address the backlog of rescheduled patients with gradual opening of our imaging facilities, while maintaining broad communication with our patients and referring clinicians. RESULTS: Recover Wisely followed our anticipated linear modelling. Considering the last 10 weeks in the recovery, outpatient growth was linear with an increase of approximately 172 cases per week, (R 2 =0.97). We achieved an overall recovery of 102% in week 10, as compared to average weekly pre-COVID outpatient volumes. The modalities recovered as follows in outpatient volumes: CT (113%), MRI (101%), nuclear medicine including PET (138%), mammograms (97%), ultrasound (99%) and interventional radiology (106%). When compared to identical 2019 calendar weeks (5/4/20-7/10/20), the total 2020 radiology volume was 11% reduced from the 2019 volume. The reduction in total weighted relative value units was 8% in this time period, as compared to 2019. CONCLUSION: Our department utilized a data-driven, team approach based on our guiding principles to Recover Wisely.

Current guidelines recommend suboccipital decompressive craniectomy (SDC) with dural expansion when medical therapy is not sufficient. However, there is no good-quality evidence to support this surgical practice, and both surgical timing and technique remain controverted. In this study, we describe an alternative to SDC, namely surgical evacuation of infarcted tissue (necrosectomy) and its clinical outcomes. METHODS: - In this retrospective, single-center study, 34 consecutive patients with SOCS undergoing necrosectomy via osteoplastic craniotomy were included. Patient characteristics and radiological findings were evaluated. In order to differentiate the effects of age on the functional outcome, patients were divided into two groups (group I: age &#8804;60; group II: age >60). Functional outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel index (BI) at the time of discharge and 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: - In our cohort, we observed a 21% overall mortality, while 76% of patients reached good functional outcome (GOS&#8805;4). No statistically significant differences in mortality or functional outcome were observed between both patient groups. Comparing our data to a recent meta-analysis on SDC, the number of adverse events and unfavorable outcome showed equipoise between both treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: - Necrosectomy appears to be a suitable alternative to SDC in SOCS, achieving comparable mortality and functional outcomes. Further trials are necessary to evaluate which surgical technique is more beneficial in the setting of SOCS.","output":"Cerebellar necrosectomy instead of suboccipital decompression: a suitable alternative in patients with space-occupying cerebellar infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates factors influencing the customers decision to use self-service kiosks in quick service restaurants A model incorporating Technology Acceptance Model and Satisfaction Model was developed to examine the relationships among trust, self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, perceived value, satisfaction and behavioural intention toward using these kiosks The moderating impact of age, gender and past self-service kiosks experience was also examined An online survey that measured customer perceptions and evaluations of self-service kiosks in McDonalds garnered 415 responses Data were analysed using structural equation modelling and multiple regression analyses Recommendations address the importance of clear, accessible information about kiosk operation;visible security measures;and enhanced features such as menu item nutrient profiles and promotions These findings and recommendations can be used to promote self-service kiosk usage, thereby addressing the COVID-19 induced prohibitions against direct service in restaurants ? 2021 The Author(s)","output":"The adoption of self-service kiosks in quick-service restaurants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine as an effective public health measure has been widely used in China and elsewhere to slow down the spread, while high-risk psychological response populations remain under-reported Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate the depressive and anxiety symptoms among the high-risk individuals quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","output":"Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms Among People Under Quarantine During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Abnormal liver function was found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

METHODS The serial laboratory data of liver function test and hepatic histological examination from 168 patients with SARS were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The abnormalities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were 52.5%, 71.8%, 85.7% and 85.2%. The average levels of ALT of the patients were 56.07+/-51.57 U/L, 86.46+/-69.93 U/L, 106.69+/-102.50 U/L and 111.32+/-160.24 U/L, and the average levels of serum albumin were 37.25+/-5.37 g/L, 35.82+/-4.74 g/L, 34.49+/-5.04 g/L, and 34.26+/-4.70 g/L, at the day of admission, the first week, second week, and third week after hospitalization, respectively. Significant correlation was not shown among liver damage, blood oxygen saturation (SaO2), degree of fever, and immune functional disorder in this study. Hepatic histological examination of 4 patients demonstrated that non-specific inflammation existed in the liver. CONCLUSIONS Liver damage of patients with SARS usually occurs in the early stage of the disease with a high occurrence rate and a prolonged profile, which can be characterized by early, obvious decrease of albumin levels and slightly abnormal levels of ALT. The liver damage induced by SARS seems to be caused by SARS virus directly rather than by low SaO2 or high fever.

At UCSF, we performed a prospective pilot study of the home-based, mail-in urine CxBladder Monitor (CxM) test to inform the urgency of surveillance cystoscopy in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: From March-June 2020, patients with NMIBC due for surveillance cystoscopy were offered CxM prior to scheduling a clinic visit. Based on prior studies, a CxM score 3.5 was used to proceed with cystoscopy while a score below that threshold led to deferring (negative predictive value 97%) cystoscopy. Outcomes of interest included whether in-office cystoscopy was deferred or performed based on CxM and detection of urothelial cancer at immediate or next surveillance cystoscopy. RESULTS: 52 patients (73% men) were included in this study. Median age was 71 (IQR 65-78) years with a median of 4.0 (IQR 2.5- 6.1) years since initial bladder cancer diagnosis;3 (6%) had a history of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). By AUA risk stratification criteria, 14 (27%), 17 (33%), and 20 (41%) were low, intermediate, and high-risk, respectively. 50% of patients had experienced recurrence since diagnosis (median 2, IQR 1-4). CxM score was 3.5 in 17 (33%) patients. These patients were more likely to have high grade disease at diagnosis (78% vs 64%, p=0.06) but did not differ by age, gender, race, history of UTUC, T stage, or prior recurrences versus patients with CxM results <3.5. 4 patients had tests that could not be resulted and had to be repeated. 14/17 patients (82%) with CxM3.5 underwent immediate cystoscopy. 7 (50%) had findings on cystoscopy necessitating biopsy (2 CIS, 2 HG Ta, 2 T2, and 1 subsequently found to have UTUC). In contrast, 35 patients with CxM scores <3.5 deferred cystoscopy to next surveillance at 3 months (63%), 6 months (34%) or 9 months (3%). Of these patients, 32 (91%) have since undergone surveillance cystoscopy (median 4.0 months after) with no suspicious tumor or cytology detected. One patient passed away from unrelated causes. CONCLUSIONS: CxM was feasible and safe for patients on surveillance for NMIBC and decreased frequency of cystoscopy. CxM may be used to further risk stratify patients to deintensify surveillance for NMIBC during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

As an important production factor, the Internet is also an important channel for farmers to obtain agricultural information, which can effectively reduce the information search cost and information asymmetry. Existing studies have mainly focused on the impact of Internet use on agricultural inputs, agricultural prices, and agricultural efficiency; there are few studies on the impact of Internet use on grain production. To fill this gap, based on the micro survey data of 1242 maize farmers in 13 provinces in China, this paper employs linear regression models and PSM methods to deeply explore the impact of Internet use on farmers grain production. The results show that Internet use has a significant positive impact on the grain production of farmers. Compared with the farmers who do not use the Internet, Internet use increases the maize yield of farmers by 14.25%. The heterogeneity analysis further shows that the impact of Internet use on the grain production of different farmers varies significantly: the maize yield per ha after using the Internet for farmers of younger, low education level, large-scale, and living in well-developed villages had increased by 13.65%, 15.38%, 23.94%, and 10.64%, respectively, compared with the counterfactual scenario of farmers who do not use the Internet.

REVIEW SUMMARY: We conducted a systematic review of published cases for COVID-19Crelated GBS, and provide a summary of clinical management strategies for these cases. Sixty-three studies, including 86 patients, were included. Seventy-six cases with reported outcome data were eligible for the outcome analysis. Ninety-nine percent of patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 before diagnosis of GBS (median: 14 d prior, interquartile range: 7 to 20). Intravenous immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin: 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 d) was the most frequently used treatment approach. The review indicated that the outcome was not favorable in 26% of cases (persistent neurological deficits). A mortality rate of 3.5% was observed in patients with COVID-19Crelated GBS. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence to support specific treatments is lacking, clinicians should consider the benefits of immunotherapy and plasma exchange in addition to the standard antimicrobial and supportive therapies for patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for acute sensory and motor polyradiculoneuritis.

In a study of 551 hematologic malignancy patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers and neutralizing activity were measured at 1 and 3 months from initial vaccination. Compared with healthy controls, patients with hematologic malignancy had attenuated antibody titers at 1 and 3 months. Furthermore, patients with hematologic malignancy had markedly diminished neutralizing capacity of 26.3% at 1 month and 43.6% at 3 months, despite positive seroconversion rates of 51.5% and 68.9% at the respective time points.

This paper empirically evaluates whether a heavy-weighted omnidirectional mobile robot can take advantage of its passive suspension system in order to also use non-optimal or suboptimal omnidirectional wheels with a non-optimized inner gap. The main comparative advantages of the proposed suboptimal omnidirectional wheel are its low manufacturing cost and the possibility of taking advantage of the gap to operate outdoors. The experimental part of this paper compares the vibrations generated by the motion system of a versatile mobile robot using optimal and suboptimal omnidirectional wheels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out in Redhill in January 2005. Citizens or Permanent Residents aged > or =18 years were randomly selected, one per household to avoid cluster bias, and 361 participated (response rate 68.7%). An interview administered questionnaire included 3 questionnaires measuring public trust: \\"Interpersonal Trust in Physicians Scale\\" for primary care doctors; \\"Trust in Physicians Generally Scale\\" for the medical profession; and \\"Trust in Healthcare System Scale\\" for the Healthcare System. Questions were answered on a Likert scale: 1. Strongly Disagree, 2. Disagree, 3. Neutral, 4. Agree, 5. Strongly Agree. Individual transformed scores of trust (range, 0 to 100) were equally divided into 5 categories with their average being the transformed mean. RESULTS Trust in primary care doctors (mean 59.7) had proportions (prevalence rates) of: very low 0.3%, low 2.5%, neutral 40.4%, high 54.0%, and very high 2.8%. Trust in the medical profession (mean 61.8) had proportions of: very low 1.0%, low 7.7%, neutral 33.7%, high 47.0%, and very high 10.5%. Trust in the healthcare system (mean 61.5) had proportions of: very low 0.5%, low 4.1%, neutral 40.0%, high 48.7%, and very high 6.7%. For areas of the healthcare system, proportions of high/very high trust were: \\"Healthcare Providers' Expertise\\" (70.8%), \\"Quality of Care\\" (61.5%), \\"Patient Focus of Providers\\" (58.7%), \\"Information Supply and Communication by Care Providers\\" (52.3%), \\"Quality of Cooperation\\" (43.3%), and Policies of the Healthcare System\\" (24.6%). CONCLUSIONS While low proportions had low/very low trust, the high proportions with neutral trust and the rather low level of trust in \\"Policies of the Healthcare System\\" are causes for concern.","output":"Public trust in primary care doctors, the medical profession and the healthcare system among Redhill residents in Singapore."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though it is widely believed that chronic immunosuppressive medications increase the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) illness, there is little data to support this.

Their name refers to their unique morphological features: an elongated bacilliform core with two rounded ends is surrounded by a membrane that may either tightly adhere to or shrink-wrap it, without respecting the capsid's rod shape; in the first instance, straight or curved rhabdovirus-like particles are formed, whereas in the latter a biconcave disk results. Torovirus history is brief: the first representative, Berne virus (BEV), was isolated in Berne, Switzerland, in 1972 from a rectal swab taken from a horse with diarrhea 1 week before it died. BEV is the only equine torovirus isolate that replicates in cell culture; since most molecular data have been obtained with this isolate, BEV has been acknowledged as the torovirus prototype. Recognition of toroviruses as a new group of potentially pathogenic viruses came seven years after the discovery of BEV, when morphologically similar particles were discovered by electron microscopy (EM) in stool specimens from calves with severe diarrhea in a dairy herd in Breda, Iowa. Despite repeated attempts, BRV has not been adapted to the growth in cell or tissue culture, a problem which has hampered its biochemical, bio-physical, and molecular characterization. However, its pathogenesis and pathology have been studied in the experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves, showing that BRV infections may cause gastroenteritis. Recently, Vanopdenbosch et al. reported the isolation of a torovirus-like virus from the respiratory tract of calves with pneumonia, suggesting that both enterotropic and pneumotropic bovine toroviruses exist. Besides the established toroviruses of horses and cattle, torovirus-like particles (TVLPs) have been found by EM in different animal species; torovirus antibodies appear to be widespread in higher vertebrates, indicating that these viruses infect a broad range of animal hosts. The possibility of a torovirus infecting humans was first reported in 1984 and has become more likely in view of the recent data. This chapter is intended to update the information about toroviruses, and to describe the similarities and differences with the related coronaviruses.","output":"Toroviruses of Animals And Humans: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Homelessness has become a major global and public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This phenomenon predisposes young adults to severe psychosocial and health challenges. AIM: To explore the sexual and reproductive health needs and behaviours of homeless young adults and challenges in accessing these services. METHODS: A semi-structured interview guide was used for data collection from in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Data were collected between 01 June and 31 July 2020 from 30 participants using in-depth interviews, two focus group discussions involving 12 participants, and one key informant interview. Thematic analysis was used to analyse transcripts from the interviews. RESULTS: The findings show that certain behavioural patterns associated with homelessness impact the lives of homeless young adults in their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) choices, beliefs, and perspectives. This group faces several challenges in accessing sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS) such as modern contraceptives and abortion care. The high cost, and undesirable and unfriendly attitude of service providers in health facilities pose as barriers to accessing SRHS by homeless young adults. CONCLUSION: Sustainable and proactive measures must be put in place to address the identified barriers. Timely delivery of accurate information and educative materials, ensuring affordability, and setting up of accessible and friendly facilities could improve SRHS for this group.

Conversely, an exaggerated inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be blunted by certain forms of immunosuppression, which could be protective.

METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7-100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7-97.8) and 100% (96.1-100).

Conservative management was favoured over laparoscopic surgery to reduce the risk from aerosol generation. The aim of this study was to record the incidence and outcomes of patients presenting with gallstone disease during this period. METHODS: A Retrospective study was carried out looking at two patient groups; Group 1 who presented during the laparoscopic ban and Group 2 who presented afterwards. RESULTS: 98 patients presented with gallstone disease during the initial UK lockdown. 25 patients presented acutely in Group 1 and 48 patients presented in Group 2, P < 0.05. 96% of patients in Group 1 were treated conservatively compared to 54% in Group 2, P<0.05. 40% of patients in Group 1 and 7% in Group 2 were readmitted within 60 days of initial presentation, P < 0.05.

However, not seldom, comorbidity precludes these patients from surgery. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the course of follow-up after treatment in submucosal EAC patients undergoing surgery versus conservative therapy and to evaluate the incidence of metastatic disease. METHODS Between 2001 and 2012, all patients undergoing diagnostic endoscopic resection for EAC in two centers were reviewed. Only patients with histopathologically proven submucosal tumor invasion were included. Submucosal EACs were divided into tumors that were removed radically (R0) and irradically (R1). Subsequently, in the R0 group, EACs were classified as either low risk (LR; submucosal invasion <500 nm, G1-G2, no LVI) or high risk (HR; deep submucosal invasion >500 nm, G3-G4 and/or LVI). Metastatic disease was defined as LNM in surgical resection specimen and/or evidence of malignant disease during follow-up (FU). RESULTS Sixty-nine patients with a submucosal EAC were included [23 R1-resections and 46 R0-resection (14 R0-LR and 32 R0-HR)]. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical treatment (1 R0-LR, 12 R0-HR and 13 R1). None of the 14 R0-LR patients developed metastatic disease after a median FU of 60 months. In the R0-HR group and R1 group, metastatic disease was diagnosed in 16 and 30 % of patients, respectively. Surgical patients tended to have a better overall survival than non-surgical patients (p = 0.09). Tumor-related deaths, however, were 12 % in both groups. CONCLUSIONS In LR submucosal EAC, the risk of metastatic disease appears to be very low. In deep submucosal EAC (either R0- or R1-resection), the rate of metastatic disease is lower than reported in earlier surgical series. Given the reasonable disease-free survival and high background mortality, conservative management of these patients seems to be a valid alternative for surgery in selected cases.","output":"Management of patients with T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma: a retrospective cohort study on patient management and risk of metastatic disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To establish a reasonable prediction model of pesticide poisoning and predict the future trend of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu Province, so as to provide the basis for rational allocation of public health resources and formulation of prevention and control strategies, the number of pesticide poisoning in Jiangsu province from 2006 to 2020 was collected.

The fitting effect of GM model is the worst, while the fitting effect of ARIMA(0,1,1) (0,1,0)(12) model and Holt-Winters multiplication model is relatively good, which can be basically used for prediction. Holt-Winters multiplicative model has the best fitting effect and the highest accuracy in predicting the number of pesticide poisoning. The numbers of pesticide poisonings in the next 3 years are 454, 410 and 368, with a total of 1232, according to the Holt-Winters multiplicative model. Through the prediction of the number of pesticide poisoning in the next 3 years, this paper also provides a basis for the formulation of pesticide-related policies in the future.","output":"Application of three prediction models in pesticide poisoning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic many health care systems have attempted to reorganize healthcare workforce. Many doctors and nurses have been redeployed to acute care wards. In order to ensure the best quality of care it is essential for health professionals to stay updated on clinical studies and novel therapeutical approaches. Most patients with COVID-19 who become seriously unwell have an acute respiratory illness and about 14 % will require non-invasive respiratory support. This article aims at presenting some of the approaches in respiratory support and drug therapy. The overview of management is based on current guidelines and conclusions of several studies. The author is aware of the fact that the approach in COVID-19 management may change over time based on the current state of knowledge. It is worth mentioning that regardless its severity clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 pneumonia may only be minor and thus regular monitoring on standard wards is required.

A previous review of definitions of social participation in older adults included articles up to 2009; new publications and changes in the social context (e.g. social media and the COVID-19 pandemic) justify continuing this work. OBJECTIVE this paper provides an updated inventory and synthesis of definitions of social participation in older adults. Based on a critical review by content experts and knowledge users, a consensual definition is proposed. METHODS using a scoping study framework, four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, AgeLine, PsycInfo) were searched with relevant keywords. Fifty-four new definitions were identified. Using content analysis, definitions were deconstructed as a function of who, how, what, where, with whom, when, and why dimensions. RESULTS social participation definitions mostly focused on people's involvement in activities providing interactions with others in society or the community. According to this new synthesis and input from content experts and knowledge users, social participation can be defined as a person's involvement in activities providing interactions with others in community life and in important shared spaces, evolving according to available time and resources, and based on the societal context and what individuals want and is meaningful to them. CONCLUSION a single definition may facilitate the study of active ageing and the contribution of older adults to society, socioeconomic and personal development, benefits for older adults and society, self-actualisation and goal attainment.","output":"Scoping study of definitions of social participation: update and co-construction of an interdisciplinary consensual definition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Few studies have reported minimally invasive total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We herein report a novel hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic technique for patients with FAP and UC. METHODS Between February 2010 and March 2014, six patients underwent hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic total proctocolectomy with IPAA. The abdominal colectomy was performed laparoscopically with hand assistance through a transverse suprapubic incision, also used to fashion the ileal pouch. The proctectomy was carried out with the da Vinci Surgical System. The IPAA was hand-sewn through a trans-anal approach. The procedure was complemented by a temporary diverting loop ileostomy. RESULTS The mean hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) time was 154.6 (12.8) min whereas the mean robotic time was 93.6 (8.1) min. In all cases, a nerve-sparing proctectomy was performed, and no conversion to traditional laparotomy was required. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 13.2 (7.4) days. No anastomotic leakage was observed. To date, no autonomic neurological disorders have been observed with a mean of 5.8 (1.3) bowel movements per day. CONCLUSIONS The hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic approach to total proctocolectomy with IPAA has not been previously described. Our report shows the feasibility of this hybrid approach, which surpasses most of the limitations of pure laparoscopic and robotic techniques. Further experience is necessary to refine the technique and fully assess its potential advantages.","output":"Hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch--anal anastomosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak and there are no evidence-based treatment strategies available for immunocompromised patients.

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel 3-arm (1:1:1 ratio), open-label, Phase IV platform trial of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with late stage 1 or stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical and/or radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a Risk count (as defined below) >3 OR 3 if risk count includes Radiographic severity score >3. A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x10(9)/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory therapies in the opinion of the investigator and be able to be maintained on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the inpatient dosing period, according to local guidelines. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospital of Wales, Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each active comparator arm will be compared against standard of care (SoC). The immunomodulatory drugs were selected from a panel of licenced candidates by a drug evaluation committee, which considered potential efficacy, potential toxicity, scalability and novelty of each strategy. The initial active arms comprise baricitinib and ravulizumab. Baricitinib will be given 4 mg orally (once daily (OD)) on days 1-14 or until day of discharge. The dose will be reduced to 2 mg OD for patients aged > 75 years and those with an estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min. Ravulizumab will be administered intravenously once according to the licensed weight-based dosing regimen (see Additional file 1). Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) of any one of the events (whichever comes first): death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or SoC.

Traditional methods of preventing this unforeseen pandemic are the lengthy process that can take several years. Now, the second wave of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc throughout the world. The survival rate can be significantly increased by predicting the risk of COVID-19 infection based on the patient's early symptoms and health status.

Similar measures during recent pandemics resulted in an increase in post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. The development of novel interventions to mitigate the mental health burden are of utmost importance. OBJECTIVE: In this rapid review, we aimed to provide a systematic overview of the literature with regard to associations between physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCE: We searched major databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SportRxiv, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar), for relevant papers up to 25/07/2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included observational studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To qualify for inclusion in the review, studies must have tested the association of PA with depression or anxiety, using linear or logistic regressions. Depression and anxiety must have been assessed using validated rating scales. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Effect sizes were represented by fully adjusted standardized betas and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% confidence intervals (CI). In case standardized effects could not be obtained, unstandardized effects were presented and indicated. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 observational studies (4 longitudinal, 1 cross-sectional with retrospective analysis, and 16 cross-sectional), including information of 42,293 (age 6-70 years, median female = 68%) participants from five continents. The early evidence suggests that people who performed PA on a regular basis with higher volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable, showed less symptoms of depression and anxiety. For instance, those reporting a higher total time spent in moderate to vigorous PA had 12-32% lower chances of presenting depressive symptoms and 15-34% of presenting anxiety. CONCLUSION: Performing PA during Covid-19 is associated with less depression and anxiety. To maintain PA routines during Covid-19, specific volitional and motivational skills might be paramount to overcome Covid-19 specific barriers. Particularly, web-based technologies could be an accessible way to increase motivation and volition for PA and maintain daily PA routines.","output":"Is Physical Activity Associated with Less Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Mortality from COVID-19 is rapidly increasing globally, with acute respiratory failure as the predominant cause of death. Many patients experience severe hypoxia and life-threatening respiratory failure often requiring mechanical ventilation. To increase safety margins during emergency anaesthesia and rapid sequence intubation (RSI), patients are preoxygenated with a closed facemask with high-flow oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Due to the high shunt fraction of deoxygenated blood through the lungs frequently described in COVID-19 however, these measures may be insufficient to avoid harmful hypoxemia. Preoxygenation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) potentially reduces the shunt fraction and may thus allow for the necessary margins of safety during RSI. METHODS AND DESIGN: The INOCOV protocol describes a phase II pharmacological trial of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as an adjunct to standard of care with medical oxygen in initial airway and ventilation management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 in acute respiratory failure. The trial is parallel two-arm, randomized, controlled, blinded trial. The primary outcome measure is the change in oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change in SpO(2) following initiation of iNO.

Most researchers have divided this structure into six main components: smart people, the smart government, smart environment, smart transportation, smart economy, and smart life. Due to the connection between smart cities and the challenges resulting from their implementation and especially its integration, there exists no perfect solution for the concept of an integrated smart city so far according to our studies. Some more general concepts such as security, ICT infrastructure, and knowledge are not seen integrative in these structures. Therefore, it seems that new sub-components and general extra-components should be added to the existing models to form an integrated structure in such a way that the executive projects are located in their proper place in this structure and create and guarantee the integration of the smart city. Therefore, the requirements engineering of the smart city can also be explained more precisely. This study presents a model of an integrated graph in such a way that besides maintaining and improving the model of the smart city and existing models, it will fully cover the integration and requirements engineering and methodologies of the smart city in the future. The present paper offers an upgraded model of a six-component smart city structure as a flexible integrated dynamic graph so that beside maintaining the features of existing smart city models, it ensures its integrity, dynamism, flexibility and performance and prevents the failure of smart operations.

Since curcumin and saliva are similarly antiviral and curcumin acts as blue light photosensitizer, we used Qubit fluorometry and WarmStart RT-LAMP assays to study the effect of combining 405 nm, 410 nm, 425 nm or 450 nm wavelengths of PBL with curcumin, saliva or a combination of curcumin and saliva against human beta coronavirus HCoV-OC43. The results showed that PBL, curcumin and saliva independently and collectively inactivate HCoV-OC43. Without saliva or curcumin supplementation 21.6 J/cm(2) PBL reduced HCoV-OC43 RNA concentration to a maximum of 32.8% (log(10) = 2.13). Saliva supplementation alone inactivated the virus, reducing its RNA concentration by 61% (log(10) = 2.23); with irradiation the reduction was as much as 79.1%. Curcumin supplementation alone decreased viral RNA 71.1%, and a maximum of 87.8% with irradiation. The combination of saliva and curcumin reduced viral RNA to 83.1% and decreased the RNA up to 90.2% with irradiation. The reduced levels could not be detected with qPCR. These findings show that PBL in the range of 405 nm to 450 nm wavelength is antiviral against human coronavirus HCoV-OC43, a surrogate of the COVID-19 virus.

Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became crucial to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We use daily COVID-19 reports from Chicago and New York City (NYC) from 01-Mar2020 to 28-Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios, where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021. To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset threshold. Results The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality, hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each city.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination Delay: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis for Chicago and New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Those on the health and social care frontline are largely aware of the benefits of vaccination, especially in relation to COVID-19.

In this context, suitable biosynthetically derived, helical regions of proteins, along with synthetic peptides with amphiphilic properties and antibacterial activities, are the most extensively investigated compounds. A strict requirement for a precise distance measurement has been identified in a minimal dynamic flexibility of the two nitroxide-bearing -amino acid side chains. To this end, in this study, we have experimentally compared in detail the side-chain mobility properties of the two currently most widely utilized residues, namely, Cys(MTSL) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC).

The research included 1928 people with an average age of 34.88 years with 1236 (64.1%) being female. A total of 1330 participants desired to have the COVID-19 vaccine (69%). Female gender, lower educational levels, following COVID-19 news through sources other than websites and social media, not following COVID-19 news, and loss of a first-degree relative due to COVID-19 were all associated with a more negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.01). To conclude, the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among Iranians is comparable to the international average; however, it is still unfavorable.

More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. FINDINGS: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.","output":"Exploring the genome and transcriptome of the cave nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea with PacBio long-read sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It seems that the medical personnel in contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at an especially high risk of adverse psychological effects.

The current interest rates decline represents monetary challenges in several areas including:: i) new financial repression;ii) financial wedges contraction at a time in which commercial banks face additional liquidity and solvency requirements due to Basle III regulations;and iii) larger credit right-offs resulting from increasing non-performing-loans.Secondly, we assess recent trends in nominal and real interest rates in Colombia and present projections based on a Taylor-Rule model. After declining 250 bps during 2020, we project the repo rate of Colombia to settle at 1.75% for the next 12-18 months, equivalent to a zero real repo-rate. However, as a result of the real-GDP recovery to 4% in 2021, after a contraction close to 6% in 2020, we forecast inflation increasing from 1.75% up to 3% during 2021-2022. In consequence, Colombias central bank would have to increase the repo-rate up to 3% (+125 bps) by end 2022. In spite of marginal losses in the efficacy of public credit subsidies, as the real repo-rate remains close to zero over 2020-2022, we conclude that Bancoldexs credit programs play a key role in supporting SMEs, while avoiding negative effects on her balance sheet.","output":"Effects on Financial Wedges, Interest Rates, and Credit Subsidies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly around the world, posing a major threat to human health and the economy.

The mechanisms by which KRV induces diabetes and TLR3 ligation facilitates this process are not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of the innate immune system plays a crucial role in diabetes induction. We report that multiple TLR agonists synergize with KRV infection to induce diabetes in BBDR rats, as do heat-killed Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus (natural TLR agonists). KRV infection increases serum IL-12 p40 in a strain-specific manner, and increases IL-12 p40, IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10, and IFN-gamma mRNA transcript levels, particularly in the pancreatic lymph nodes of BBDR rats. Infection with vaccinia virus or H-1 parvovirus induced less stimulation of the innate immune system and failed to induce diabetes in BBDR rats.

METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000).

A sophisticated hyper-inflammatory reaction named cytokine storm is occurred in patients with severe/critical COVID-19, following an imbalance in immune-inflammatory processes and inhibition of antiviral responses by SARS-CoV-2, which leads to pulmonary failure, ARDS, and death. The miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with an average length of 22 nucleotides which play various roles as one of the main modulators of genes expression and maintenance of immune system homeostasis. Recent evidence has shown that Homo sapiens (hsa)-miRNAs have the potential to work in three pivotal areas including targeting the virus genome, regulating the inflammatory signaling pathways, and reinforcing the production/signaling of IFNs-I. However, it seems that several SARS-CoV-2-induced interfering agents such as viral (v)-miRNAs, cytokine content, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), etc. preclude efficient function of hsa-miRNAs in severe/critical COVID-19. This subsequently leads to increased virus replication, intense inflammatory processes, and secondary complications development. In this review article, we provide an overview of hsa-miRNAs roles in viral genome targeting, inflammatory pathways modulation, and IFNs responses amplification in severe/critical COVID-19 accompanied by probable interventional factors and their function.

PD studies have shown larger positive effects on motor outcomes than usual treadmill training. However, effects on cognition, in contrast, are less clear. Existing studies provided intensive training protocols and included only stable medicated patients. Thus, a pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to analyze the feasibility of a shorter training protocol as well as preliminary effects on cognition, motor function, and patient-centered outcomes in a rehabilitation setting where PD patients with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS) undergo adaptation of medication and DBS settings. Here, we present the results from the feasibility analysis of the still ongoing trial. Methods: Non-demented PD patients with and without DBS were recruited during their inpatient rehabilitation and randomized to an experimental group (EG; 20 min MATT) or an active control group (CG; 20 min bike ergometer training). The trainings took place for 8 consecutive days and were added to the usual rehabilitation. Feasibility was assessed with the following parameters: patients' study protocol acceptance, study protocol transferability into clinical routine, training-induced adverse events, and patients' training perception. Results: Thirty-two patients (EG: n = 15; CG: n = 17; 72% DBS) were included. The study protocol was well-accepted (inclusion rate: 84%). It was transferable into clinical routines; dropout rates of 40% (EG) and 18% (CG) were observed. However, an in-depth analysis of the dropout cohort did not reveal intervention-related dropout reasons. The MATT and the standard ergometer training showed no adverse events and were positively perceived by PD patients with and without DBS. Conclusion: MATT was shown to be a feasible, safe, and enjoyable treatment option in PD patients with and without DBS. Furthermore, the dropout cohort analysis revealed some exciting first insights into possible dropout reasons that go beyond the form of intervention. Therefore, research would benefit from a common practice of dropout analyses, as this would enhance our understanding of patients' therapy adherence and expectations.","output":"Feasibility of Music-Assisted Treadmill Training in Parkinson's Disease Patients With and Without Deep Brain Stimulation: Insights From an Ongoing Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the recent study by Kovalic AJ et al.((1)) showing that patients with severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) may suffer elevated liver biochemistries.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of weekly patients of acute URTIs, COVID-19, and the prescribed number of antibiotics in Finland between 6 January 2020 and 21 June 2020. We estimated the respective expected numbers from 1 March 2020 onward using autoregressive integrated moving average model from 1 January 2017 to 1 March 2020. We assessed the public interest in COVID-19 by collecting Google search trend frequencies. RESULTS: There was a rapid increase in COVID-related internet searches between weeks 10 and 12. At the same time, there was a 106% increase in diagnoses of acute URTIs, from 410 per 100 000 inhabitants to 845 per 100 000. The first COVID-19 cases were diagnosed on week 11. Prescriptions for URTI-related antibiotics declined by 71% (403 per 100 000 to 117 per 100 000) between weeks 11 and 15 while no relevant change took place in prescriptions of antibiotics for urinary tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: At the beginning of the epidemic, many people contacted healthcare professionals with relatively mild symptoms, as indicated by the reduced rate of URTI-antibiotics prescriptions. Our findings indicate that health service providers should be prepared for rapid variations in service demand. Securing access of true COVID-19 patients to proper diagnostics, care and isolation measures may help in preventing the spread of the disease.","output":"Time series analysis of the incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections, COVID-19 and the use of antibiotics in Finland during the COVID-19 epidemic: a cohort study of 833 444 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With large waves of infection driven by the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alongside evidence of waning immunity after the booster dose of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, several countries have begun giving at-risk persons a fourth vaccine dose. METHODS: To evaluate the early effectiveness of a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19Crelated outcomes, we analyzed data recorded by the largest health care organization in Israel from January 3 to February 18, 2022. We evaluated the relative effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose as compared with that of a third dose given at least 4 months earlier among persons 60 years of age or older. We compared outcomes in persons who had received a fourth dose with those in persons who had not, individually matching persons from these two groups with respect to multiple sociodemographic and clinical variables. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the use of parametric Poisson regression. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 182,122 matched pairs. Relative vaccine effectiveness in days 7 to 30 after the fourth dose was estimated to be 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 47) against polymerase-chain-reactionCconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55% (95% CI, 53 to 58) against symptomatic Covid-19, 68% (95% CI, 59 to 74) against Covid-19Crelated hospitalization, 62% (95% CI, 50 to 74) against severe Covid-19, and 74% (95% CI, 50 to 90) against Covid-19Crelated death. The corresponding estimates in days 14 to 30 after the fourth dose were 52% (95% CI, 49 to 54), 61% (95% CI, 58 to 64), 72% (95% CI, 63 to 79), 64% (95% CI, 48 to 77), and 76% (95% CI, 48 to 91). In days 7 to 30 after a fourth vaccine dose, the difference in the absolute risk (three doses vs. four doses) was 180.1 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 142.8 to 211.9) for Covid-19Crelated hospitalization and 68.8 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 48.5 to 91.9) for severe Covid-19.

Older adult nutrition programs are based on federal nutrition guidelines that have traditionally focused on healthy populations, yet many older adults have multiple chronic conditions/advanced age. Some guidelines are changing; the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognize older adults risk for malnutrition and also need for adequate protein to prevent lean muscle loss with age. The 2020 Older Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization included reduction of malnutrition in OAAs official purpose and added program participant screening for malnutrition. The OAA requires State Agencies on Aging submit multiyear strategic plans to receive program funding, but it is unknown how the plans address risks for malnutrition, including overweight, underweight, and muscle loss (sarcopenia/frailty). We searched 51 State Agency on Aging strategic plans posted at advancingstates.org to determine their frequency of mentioning nutrition, malnutrition/underweight/undernutrition, obesity/overweight, frail/frailty, sarcopenia, and dietary supplements/oral nutrition supplements (DS/ONS)/meal replacements. Every state plan included nutrition but less than a third included malnutrition. There was wide variability in how nutrition and malnutrition were incorporated into state goals and strategies. Very few plans included obesity, frailty, and DS/ONS terms; none included sarcopenia. Although there has been some movement, there is need for many State Agencies on Aging plans to address all aspects of malnutrition including overweight, underweight/other factors related to muscle loss (sarcopenia/frailty) that adversely impact healthy aging.

The goal of CareMongering is to care for community members, particularly those experiencing social exclusion, by organizing groups at a local level to support access to basic necessities, services, and resources (e.g., providing groceries and childcare to frontline workers). Following from feminist calls to ?trouble? care, we explore the uncomfortable relations that emerged while practicing CareMongering through a case study of a group in Ontario, Canada. Using semi-structured interviews with group members and organizers and ethnographic content analysis of Facebook group activity, we examine (1) difficult interactions on the group's public Facebook page, (2) strategies used to moderate the group, and (3) the affective and embodied experiences involved in virtually organizing CareMongering. We illustrate our findings through vignettes of one of the author's experiences as a CareMongering group member and composite narratives of social media interactions. We argue that by enacting critical community care, CareMongering groups have the potential to practice care that goes beyond simply caring for or about community needs to also care with communities. The hard work of critical community care involves an intersectional, reflexive, and relational approach that addresses underlying inequalities and promotes actions aimed toward making structural and collective change.","output":"From the nice work to the hard work: Troubling community-based CareMongering during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Travel-time prediction constitutes a task of high importance in transportation networks, with web mapping services like Google Maps regularly serving vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike. Further, such a task requires accounting for complex spatiotemporal interactions (modelling both the topological properties of the road network and anticipating events -- such as rush hours -- that may occur in the future). Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps. While our main architecture consists of standard GNN building blocks, we further detail the usage of training schedule methods such as MetaGradients in order to make our model robust and production-ready. We also provide prescriptive studies: ablating on various architectural decisions and training regimes, and qualitative analyses on real-world situations where our model provides a competitive edge.

Objective To determine the association between perioperative hsTnT measurements and 30-day mortality and potential diagnostic criteria for MINS (ie, myocardial injury due to ischemia associated with 30-day mortality). Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study of patients aged 45 years or older who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgery and had a postoperative hsTnT measurement. Starting in October 2008, participants were recruited at 23 centers in 13 countries; follow-up finished in December 2013. Exposures Patients had hsTnT measurements 6 to 12 hours after surgery and daily for 3 days; 40.4% had a preoperative hsTnT measurement. Main Outcomes and Measures A modified Mazumdar approach (an iterative process) was used to determine if there were hsTnT thresholds associated with risk of death and had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.0 or higher and a risk of 30-day mortality of 3% or higher. To determine potential diagnostic criteria for MINS, regression analyses ascertained if postoperative hsTnT elevations required an ischemic feature (eg, ischemic symptom or electrocardiography finding) to be associated with 30-day mortality. Results Among 21 842 participants, the mean age was 63.1 (SD, 10.7) years and 49.1% were female. Death within 30 days after surgery occurred in 266 patients (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that compared with the reference group (peak hsTnT <5 ng/L), peak postoperative hsTnT levels of 20 to less than 65 ng/L, 65 to less than 1000 ng/L, and 1000 ng/L or higher had 30-day mortality rates of 3.0% (123/4049; 95% CI, 2.6%-3.6%), 9.1% (102/1118; 95% CI, 7.6%-11.0%), and 29.6% (16/54; 95% CI, 19.1%-42.8%), with corresponding adjusted HRs of 23.63 (95% CI, 10.32-54.09), 70.34 (95% CI, 30.60-161.71), and 227.01 (95% CI, 87.35-589.92), respectively. An absolute hsTnT change of 5 ng/L or higher was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 3.52-6.25). An elevated postoperative hsTnT (ie, 20 to <65 ng/L with an absolute change 5 ng/L or hsTnT 65 ng/L) without an ischemic feature was associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 2.37-4.32). Among the 3904 patients (17.9%; 95% CI, 17.4%-18.4%) with MINS, 3633 (93.1%; 95% CI, 92.2%-93.8%) did not experience an ischemic symptom. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, peak postoperative hsTnT during the first 3 days after surgery was significantly associated with 30-day mortality.

Long-term care facilities are at particularly high risk of outbreaks, and the burden of morbidity and mortality is very high among residents living in these facilities. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities to prevent or reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents, staff, and visitors. SEARCH METHODS On 22 January 2021, we searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Web of Science, and CINAHL. We also conducted backward citation searches of existing reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effects of the measures implemented in long-term care facilities to protect residents and staff against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary outcomes were infections, hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19, contaminations of and outbreaks in long-term care facilities, and adverse health effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author performed data extractions, risk of bias assessments and quality appraisals, and at least one other author checked their accuracy. Risk of bias and quality assessments were conducted using the ROBINS-I tool for cohort and interrupted-time-series studies, the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for case-control studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively, focusing on the direction of effect. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, with the author team critically discussing the ratings. MAIN RESULTS We included 11 observational studies and 11 modelling studies in the analysis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. Most studies compared outcomes in long-term care facilities that implemented the measures with predicted or observed control scenarios without the measure (but often with baseline infection control measures also in place). Several modelling studies assessed additional comparator scenarios, such as comparing higher with lower rates of testing. There were serious concerns regarding risk of bias in almost all observational studies and major or critical concerns regarding the quality of many modelling studies. Most observational studies did not adequately control for confounding. Many modelling studies used inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of the models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Overall, we identified five intervention domains, each including a number of specific measures. Entry regulation measures (4 observational studies; 4 modelling studies) Self-confinement of staff with residents may reduce the number of infections, probability of facility contamination, and number of deaths. Quarantine for new admissions may reduce the number of infections. Testing of new admissions and intensified testing of residents and of staff after holidays may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain regarding whether restricting admissions of new residents reduces the number of infections, but the measure may reduce the probability of facility contamination. Visiting restrictions may reduce the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, it may increase the probability of facility contamination, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is very uncertain how visiting restrictions may adversely affect the mental health of residents. Contact-regulating and transmission-reducing measures (6 observational studies; 2 modelling studies) Barrier nursing may increase the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent cleaning and environmental hygiene measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. It is unclear how contact reduction measures affect the probability of outbreaks. These measures may reduce the number of infections, but the evidence is very uncertain. Personal hygiene measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Mask and personal protective equipment usage may reduce the number of infections, the probability of outbreaks, and the number of deaths, but the evidence is very uncertain. Cohorting residents and staff may reduce the number of infections, although evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent contact -regulating and transmission -reducing measures may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Surveillance measures (2 observational studies; 6 modelling studies) Routine testing of residents and staff independent of symptoms may reduce the number of infections. It may reduce the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Evidence from one observational study suggests that the measure may reduce, while the evidence from one modelling study suggests that it probably reduces hospitalisations. The measure may reduce the number of deaths among residents, but the evidence on deaths among staff is unclear. Symptom-based surveillance testing may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Outbreak control measures (4 observational studies; 3 modelling studies) Separating infected and non-infected residents or staff caring for them may reduce the number of infections. The measure may reduce the probability of outbreaks and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. Isolation of cases may reduce the number of infections and the probability of outbreaks, but the evidence is very uncertain. Multicomponent measures (2 observational studies; 1 modelling study) A combination of multiple infection-control measures, including various combinations of the above categories, may reduce the number of infections and may reduce the number of deaths, but the evidence for the latter is very uncertain. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review provides a comprehensive framework and synthesis of a range of non-pharmacological measures implemented in long-term care facilities. These may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences. However, the certainty of evidence is predominantly low to very low, due to the limited availability of evidence and the design and quality of available studies. Therefore, true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Overall, more studies producing stronger evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological measures are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries and on possible unintended consequences of these measures. Future research should explore the reasons behind the paucity of evidence to guide pandemic research priority setting in the future.","output":"Non-pharmacological measures implemented in the setting of long-term care facilities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and their consequences: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic, and its management, is markedly impacting the management of osteoporosis as judged by access to online FRAX fracture risk assessments. Globally, access was 58% lower in April than in February 2020. Strategies to improve osteoporosis care, with greater use of fracture risk assessments, offer a partial solution. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant detrimental impact on the management of chronic diseases including osteoporosis. We have quantified the global impact by examining changes in the usage of online FRAX fracture risk assessments before and after the declaration of the pandemic (11 March 2020). METHODS: The study comprised a retrospective analysis using GoogleAnalytics data on daily sessions on the FRAX? website (www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX) from November 2019 to April 2020 (main analysis period FebruaryCApril 2020), and the geographical source of that activity. RESULTS: Over FebruaryCApril 2020, the FRAX website recorded 460,495 sessions from 184 countries, with 210,656 sessions in February alone. In March and April, the number of sessions fell by 23.1% and 58.3% respectively, a pattern not observed over the same period in 2019. There were smaller reductions in Asia than elsewhere, partly related to earlier and less-marked nadirs in some countries (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam). In Europe, the majority of countries (24/31, 77.4%) reduced usage by at least 50% in April. Seven countries showed smaller reductions (range ? 2.85 to ? 44.1%) including Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Finland. There was no significant relationship between the reduction in FRAX usage and measures of disease burden such as COVID-attributed deaths per million of the population. CONCLUSION: This study documents a marked global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of osteoporosis as reflected by FRAX online fracture risk assessments. The analysis suggests that impact may relate to the societal and healthcare measures taken to ameliorate the pandemic.

As the clinical realm has rapidly adjusted to the realities of the pandemic, anesthesiology literature has also changed significantly to reflect this. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has had on anesthesiology literature. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the COVID-19-related literature in the anesthesiology community would gain more interest than non-COVID-19-related articles. A total of 15 anesthesiology-related journals with the highest impact factor in 2019, according to the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), were selected for data collection. An advanced PubMed search identified 5,722 COVID-19-related articles published by these journals in 2020. Next, articles with titles including corona, COVID, COVID-19, pandemic, SARS, or SARS-CoV-2 were selected for inclusion in the study, which resulted in 676 (12%) articles. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the Altmetric score, which is a weighted calculation of the attention an article receives online, for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 articles. Articles were then further characterized across multiple different variables, including country of origin, month published, type of article, and subspecialty of anesthesiology it pertained to. Of the 15 journals investigated, 676 (12%) articles of the 5,722 total articles published were found to be COVID-19-related material. The majority of the articles were found to be published in April (18%), May (19.5%), and June (14%). The majority of these articles were related either to general anesthesia (operating room anesthesiology that is not tied to a particular subspecialty fellowship track) (48%) or critical care (39%). By article type, most were determined to be editorial (71%) in nature, followed by original research articles (21%), of which most were cross-sectional (55%) studies. When compared with non-COVID-19-related articles, COVID-19-related articles had a significantly greater Altmetric score (29.518 versus 8.6333, p < 0.001). Of the COVID-19-related articles, original articles had the greatest Altmetric score, when compared to editorials and guidelines (54.794 versus 20.777 versus 40.643, p < 0.002).

Therefore this paper develops an open experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis. The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development.

METHODS: An HCV progression Markov model was developed considering DAA eligibility and population data during the years 2015-2019. The period of time to recover the investment in DAAs was calculated as the cost saved by avoiding estimated clinical events for 1000 standardized treated patients. A delayed treatment scenario because of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was also developed. RESULTS: The estimated number of avoided hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplantations over a 20-year time horizon was: 1,057 in England; 1,221 in Italy; 1,211 in Romania; and 1,103 in Spain for patients treated during 2015-2016 and 640 in England; 626 in Italy; 739 in Romania; and 643 in Spain for patients treated during 2017-2019. The cost-savings ranged from ? 45 to ? 275 million. The investment needed to expand access to DAAs in 2015-2019 is estimated to be recovered in 6.5 years in England; 5.4 years in Italy; 6.7 years in Romania; and 4.5 years in Spain. A delay in treatment because of COVID-19 will increase liver mortality in all countries. CONCLUSION: Direct-acting antivirals have significant clinical benefits and can bring substantial cost-savings over the next 20 years, reaching a Break-even point in a short period of time.

To better understand the relationship between peripheral blood- and brain-based epigenetic activity, we conducted a pilot study on captive baboons (Papio hamadryas) to investigate correlations between miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 14 different cortical and subcortical brain regions, represented by two study groups comprised of 4 and 6 animals. Using next-generation sequencing, we identified 362 miRNAs expressed at  10 read counts in 80% or more of the brain samples analyzed. Nominally significant pairwise correlations (one-sided P < 0.05) between peripheral blood and mean brain expression levels of individual miRNAs were observed for 39 and 44 miRNAs in each group. When miRNA expression levels were averaged for tissue type across animals within the groups, Spearman's rank correlations between PBMCs and the brain regions are all highly significant (r s = 0.47-0.57; P < 2.2  10-16), although pairwise correlations among the brain regions are markedly stronger (r s = 0.86-0.99). Principal component analysis revealed differentiation in miRNA expression between peripheral blood and the brain regions for the first component (accounting for a??75% of variance). Linear mixed effects modeling attributed most of the variance in expression to differences between miRNAs (>70%), with non-significant 7.5% and 13.1% assigned to differences between blood and brain-based samples in the two study groups. Hierarchical UPGMA clustering revealed a major co-expression branch in both study groups, comprised of miRNAs globally upregulated in blood relative to the brain samples, exhibiting an enrichment of miRNAs expressed in immune cells (CD14+, CD15+, CD19+, CD3+, and CD56 + leukocytes) among the top blood-brain correlates, with the gene MYC, encoding a master transcription factor that regulates angiogenesis and neural stem cell activation, representing the most prevalent miRNA target. Although some differentiation was observed between tissue types, these preliminary findings reveal wider correlated patterns between blood- and brain-expressed miRNAs, suggesting the potential utility of blood-based miRNA profiling for investigating by proxy certain miRNA activity in the brain, with implications for neuroinflammatory and c-Myc-mediated processes.","output":"Blood-Based miRNA Biomarkers as Correlates of Brain-Based miRNA Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An introduction is presented to a series of articles within the issue focused on the importance of good communication skills and compassion to providing nursing care for cancer patients.","output":"Communication and compassion are crucial in cancer care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of medical cannabis consumption on oral flora and saliva. DESIGN: A clinical prospective study, at the rheumatology clinic of the Nazareth Hospital in Nazareth, recruiting consecutively patients approved for medical cannabis, evaluating their saliva flow, pH and microbial load of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus, prior to and under medical cannabis treatment. METHODS: Patients recently licensed for medical cannabis treatment, were recruited just prior to starting medical cannabis consumption (week 0), 1 and 4 weeks later, patients provided 5-minute time saliva samples, which were measured for their volume and pH, and cultured on a special microbial kit, evaluating the growth of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients enrolled, 14 were female and had fibromyalgia. The mean age of the patients was 52.812.9 years. The mean saliva flow at week 0, week 1 and week 4 were 5.383.36 ml/5-minutes, 6 (p = 0.769) and 5.45 (p = 0.391), respectively, and for saliva pH were 6.28, 5.94 (p = 0.51) and 5.5 (p = 0.07) respectively also.

Epidemiological modelling is vital to guiding evidence-informed or data-driven decision making. In forced displacement contexts, and in particular refugee and internally displaced people (IDP) settlements, it meets several challenges including data availability and quality, the applicability of existing models to those contexts, the accurate modelling of cultural differences or specificities of those operational settings, the communication of results and uncertainties, as well as the alignment of strategic goals between diverse partners in complex situations. In this paper, we systematically review the limited epidemiological modelling work applied to refugee and IDP settlements so far, and discuss challenges and identify lessons learnt from the process. With the likelihood of disease outbreaks expected to increase in the future as more people are displaced due to conflict and climate change, we call for the development of more approaches and models specifically designed to include the unique features and populations of refugee and IDP settlements. To strengthen collaboration between the modelling and the humanitarian public health communities, we propose a roadmap to encourage the development of systems and frameworks to share needs, build tools and coordinate responses in an efficient and scalable manner, both for this pandemic and for future outbreaks.","output":"Epidemiological modelling in refugee and internally displaced people settlements: challenges and ways forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: While pulmonary embolism (PE) appears to be a major issue in Covid-19, data remain sparse Purpose: We aimed to describe the risk factors and baseline characteristics of patients with PE in a large cohort of Covid-19 patients Methods: In a retrospective multicentric observational study, we included consecutive hospitalised patients for Covid-19 Patients without computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-proven PE diagnosis, those who were directly admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and those still hospitalised without PE experience were excluded Results: Among 1240 patients (58 1% men, mean age 64  17 years), 103 (8 3%) patients had PE confirmed by CTPA The ICU transfer requirement and mechanical ventilation requirement were significantly higher in the PE group (P 0 05), while patients under therapeutic-dose anticoagulation before hospitalisation or prophylaxis-dose anticoagulation introduced during hospitalisation had lower PE occurrence (OR 0 40, 95%CI(0 14-0 91);P = 0 04 and OR 0 11, 95%CI(0 06-0 18);P &lt; 0 001, respectively) In a multivariable analysis, the following variables (also statistically significant in univariable analysis) were associated with PE: male gender (OR 1 03, 95%CI(1 003-1 069);P = 0 04), anticoagulation with prophylaxis-dose (OR 0 83, 95%CI(0 79-0 85), P &lt; 0 001) or therapeutic-dose (OR 0 87, 95%CI(0 82-0 92), P &lt; 0 001), C-reactive protein (OR 1 03, 95%CI(1 01-1 04), P = 0 001) and time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (OR 1 02, 95%CI(1 006-1 038), P = 0 002) (Table 1) Conclusion: Pulmonary embolism risk factors in Covid-19 context do not include traditional thromboembolic risk factors but rather independent clinical and biological findings at admission, including a major contribution to inflammation","output":"Pulmonary Embolism in Covid-19 patients: A French Multicentre Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, one of the great challenges is to generate effective strategies for the control of nosocomial infections, specifically in psychiatric hospitals with populations considered at risk (older adults or individuals with comorbidities).

A seasonal pattern, particularly if combined with other seasonal outbreaks of respiratory virus infections, may have significant impacts on the healthcare system. We evaluated the seasonal pattern of existing endemic coronaviruses and several other common respiratory viruses to determine the potential impacts of added burden of respiratory disease should SARS-CoV-2 establish seasonality. Methods National surveillance data for laboratory confirmations of endemic coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus for the past 10 years were obtained from the Government of Canada Open Data and FluWatch. Epidemic curves were generated from total case numbers and percent of samples testing positive for each respiratory virus by epidemiological week. Results In Canada, endemic coronaviruses and other common respiratory viruses cause annual seasonal outbreaks in the winter months. Should SARS-CoV-2 develop a seasonal pattern similar to endemic coronaviruses and respiratory viruses, co-circulation would be expected to peak between January and March. Peak endemic coronavirus activity occurs during the nadir of rhinovirus/enterovirus and parainfluenza activity. Conclusion Healthcare settings, assisted-living and long-term care homes, schools and essential services employers should anticipate and have contingencies for seasonal outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and co-circulating respiratory viruses during peak seasons. Given the likelihood of co-circulation, diagnostic multiplex testing targeting co-circulating pathogens may be more efficient than single target assays for symptomatic individuals if a seasonal pattern to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is established.","output":"Seasonality of coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses in Canada: Implications for COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to conduct research involving human-robot interactions (HRIs) As a result, many robot competitions have been canceled in the past year To address this problem, we propose a cloud-based VR platform for the crowdsourcing of embodied cognition with multiple human users and a virtual robot The feasibility of the platform is evaluated from the latency of the interactive events and the motions of avatars, based on the number of users logging in to the VR scene and the distance between the local and server environments We also discuss the feasibility of our system when dealing with large-scale datasets in embodied HRI experiments [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Advanced Robotics is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"VR platform enabling crowdsourcing of embodied HRI experiments C case study of online robot competition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) became the outbreak of infectious diseases emergency worldwide.

The present study aims to describe the prevalence of food insecurity among adults and households with children living in the United States during the pandemic. METHODS: This study utilized social media as a recruitment platform to administer an original online survey on demographics and COVID-related food insecurity. The survey was disseminated through an advertisement campaign on Facebook and affiliated platforms. Food insecurity was assessed with a validated six-item United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module, which was used to create a six-point numerical food security score, where a higher score indicates lower food security. Individual-level participant demographic information was also collected. Logistic regressions (low/very-low compared with high/marginal food security) were performed to generate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95%CIs for food insecurity and select demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Advertisements reached 250,701 individuals and resulted in 5,606 complete surveys. Overall, 14.7% of participants self-identified as having low or very low food security in their households, with higher prevalence (17.5%) among households with children. Unemployment (AOR:1.76, 95%CI:1.09C2.80), high school or lower education (AOR:2.25, 95%CI:1.29C3.90), and low income (AOR[$30,000-$50,000]:5.87, 95%CI:3.35C10.37; AOR[< $30,000]:10.61, 95%CI:5.50C20.80) were associated with higher odds of food insecurity in multivariable models among households with children (and the whole sample).

Incident cases were estimated by multiplying the prevalence and estimated population sizes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. RESULTS It was estimated that 17% of adolescents would try (13%) or use (4%), and 32% of young adults would try (15%) or use (17%) cannabis if it were legal. Among those who reported an intention to try it, 85% of adolescents and 59% of young adults had never used cannabis. These translate to 199 000 and 238 000 potential initiators, respectively. Among those with an intention to use cannabis, 21% of adolescents and 3% of young adults had never used cannabis. These translate to 14 000 adolescents and 12 000 young adults who intended to use cannabis if it were legal.

METHODS Thirty participants were randomised to continue in Sp (n = 15) or wear somofilcon A daily disposable CL (n = 15) ('group'). A surgical face mask (Type II R) was worn for at least one hour per day on four or more days per week. After two weeks, participants completed the Quality of Life Impact of Refractive Correction Questionnaire (QIRC), a two-part face mask usability questionnaire and graded ocular-related symptoms using 0-100 visual analogue scales. RESULTS There was no difference between groups for overall QIRC score but some individual question scores reflected better quality of life in the CL: 'outdoor activities', 'keep fit' and 'able to do things' (all p < 0.05). Differences in favour of the CL were seen for the following in the face mask usability questionnaire: 'breathing', 'heat', 'comfort on ears', 'overall comfort', 'walking', 'driving', 'reading', 'computer use', 'exercising' and 'socialising' (all p < 0.05). Significant differences were also seen for the 0-100 VAS symptoms probing vision quality in favour of the CL: glare, distance and near vision, fogging, restricted field of view and peripheral blur. CONCLUSION This work supports anecdotal reports that CL are a better vision correction option than Sp when used in conjunction with a face mask. Participants reported a range of benefits to the CL/face mask combination for vision-related symptoms, breathing and heat-related symptoms and a number of day-to-day activities including walking, driving and exercising. All of the benefits relating to the CL are likely to result in improved adherence to face mask use. Overall, the findings of this work suggest that where possible, CL should be the preferred vision correction option for people using face masks.","output":"Using face masks with spectacles versus contact lenses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has made funders, researchers and publishers agree to have research publications, as well as other research outputs, such as data, become openly available. In this extraordinary research context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, publishers are announcing that their coronavirus-related articles will be made immediately accessible in appropriate open repositories, like PubMed Central (PMC), agreeing upon funders and researchers instigation. Methods: This work uses Unpaywall, OpenRefine and PubMed to analyse the level of openness of the papers about COVID-19, published during the first quarter of 2020. It also analyses Open Access (OA) articles published about previous coronavirus (SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV) as a means of comparison. Results: A total of 5,611 COVID-19-related articles were analysed from PubMed. This is a much higher amount for a period of 4 months compared to those found for SARS CoV-1 and MERS during the first year of their first outbreaks (337 and 125 articles, respectively). Regarding the levels of openness, 97.4% of the SARS CoV-2 papers are freely available; similar rates were found for the other coronaviruses. Deeper analysis showed that (i) 68.3% of articles belong to an undefined Bronze category; (ii) 72.1% of all OA papers dont carry a specific license and in all cases where there is, half of them do not meet Open Access standards; (iii) there is a large proportion that present a copy in a repository, in most cases in PMC, where this trend is also observed.

Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Management of emergency care BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing worldwide pandemic infection. Healthcare workers must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control prevention techniques given the high risk of transmission and potential morbidity associated with COVID-19. We present a case report highlighting the strengths and potential applications of telemedicine technology in a patients evaluation during an ongoing emerging, novel infectious disease. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of fever. His presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a known exposure. Telemedicine evaluation was performed using InTouch Provider(?) software (InTouch Health, Goleta, CA, USA). The treating clinician was able to interact with the patient entirely through observations via web camera. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction testing was ordered and was performed by a dedicated triage nurse. The patient was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. Approximately 72 hours after discharge from the ED, the patient was contacted with positive COVID-19 swab results. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19 in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place, this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit clinician exposure, decrease risk of transmission to key personnel, and assisted with preserving PPE supplies.

Therefore, the CDC recommends routine immunizations for children and adolescent populations against vaccine-preventable diseases e.g., tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, etc. This current review sought to examine barriers to pediatric vaccine uptake behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the implications for parental vaccine hesitancy/delay during an ongoing health crisis and proposed recommendations for increasing vaccine confidence and compliance. Our review determined that the receipt for vaccinations steadily improved in the last decade for both the United States and Tennessee. However, this incremental progress has been forestalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and other barriers i.e. parental vaccine hesitancy, social determinants of health (SDoH) inequalities, etc. which further exacerbate vaccination disparities. Moreover, non-compliance to routine vaccinations could cause an outbreak of diseases, thereby, worsening the ongoing health crisis and already strained health care system. Healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to offer effective recommendations with presumptive languaging to increase vaccination rates, as well as, address parental vaccine hesitancy. Best practices that incorporate healthcare providers quality improvement coaching, vaccination reminder recall systems, adherence to standardized safety protocols (physical distancing, hand hygiene practices, etc.), as well as, offer telehealth and outdoor/drive-through/curbside vaccination services, etc. are warranted.

While the etiology of most pneumonia and ARI episodes is undiagnosed, a broad range of ARI-causing viruses circulate widely in South East Asia. However, the patterns and drivers of the seasonal transmission dynamics are largely unknown. Here we identify the seasonal patterns of multiple circulating viruses associated with hospitalizations for ARIs in Nha Trang, Vietnam. METHODS: Hospital based enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI is ongoing at Khanh Hoa General Hospital in Nha Trang. RT-PCR was performed to detect 13 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal samples from enrolled patients. Seasonal patterns of childhood ARI hospital admissions of various viruses were assessed, as well as their association with rainfall, temperature, and dew point. RESULTS: Respiratory syncytial virus peaks in the late summer months, and influenza A in April to June. We find significant associations between detection of human parainfluenza 3 and human rhinovirus with the month's mean dew point. Using a cross-wavelet transform we find a significant out-of-phase relationship between human parainfluenza 3 and temperature and dew point.

By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/l), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay).

Here, using a computational framework based on the 2D Zernike formalism we investigate details of the molecular binding and evaluate the changes in ACE2-Spike binding compatibility upon mutations occurring in the ACE2 side of the molecular interface.

With COVID-19, Australia is in relatively better shape than most other countries and is generally regarded as having managed the pandemic well. That said, we believe there is a critical need to start the process of learning from this pandemic to improve the quantitative information and related advice provided to policy makers. A dispassionate assessment of Australia's health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals some important inadequacies in the data, statistical analysis and interpretation used to guide Australia's preparations and actions. For example, one key shortcoming has been the lack of data to obtain an early understanding of the extent of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases or the differences across age groups, occupations or ethnic groups. Minimising the combined health, social and economic impacts of a novel virus depends critically on ongoing acquisition, integration, analysis, interpretation and presentation of a variety of data streams to inform the development, execution and monitoring of appropriate strategies. The article captures the essential quantitative components of such an approach for each of the four basic phases, from initial detection to post-pandemic.

Nevertheless, there are still many divisive changes that need to be made in order to implement UAVs into a countrys humanitarian sector successfully. Hence, this paper aims to analyze the various barriers hindering the implementation of UAVs in humanitarian logistics for both developed and developing nations. To accomplish this, the study is presented in three steps. First, previous literature and opinions from experts are analyzed to illuminate particular factors that hinder UAV implementation. Next, we propose an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) based graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA) to calculate a drone implementation hindrance index (DIHI). The GTMA method used in this paper utilizes the PERMAN algorithm to calculate the permanent function. Finally, the DIHI values are plotted and analyzed to compare the readiness of drone implementation between developed and developing economies. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to provide validity to the results obtained. The study has revealed that both types of countries must first improve their inadequate government regulations regarding humanitarian UAVs. Developing countries must also focus on enhancing the technological awareness of their population. The results of this study can be used by policymakers and practitioners to smoothly implement UAVs in their country's humanitarian sector. The general index defined in this paper can also be calculated for specific countries using the steps mentioned in the manuscript.","output":"Uncovering interrelationships between barriers to unmanned aerial vehicles in humanitarian logistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA1) is a progressive disease and is usually fatal in the first year of life. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of SMA1 patients and their outcomes according to the following choices: letting nature take its course (NT); tracheostomy and invasive mechanical ventilation (TV); continuous noninvasive respiratory muscle aid (NRA), including noninvasive ventilation; and mechanically assisted cough. RESULTS Of 194 consecutively referred patients enrolled in this study (103 males, 91 females), NT, TV, and NRA were chosen for 121 (62.3%), 42 (21.7%), and 31 (16%) patients, respectively. Survival at ages 24 and 48 months was higher in TV than NRA users: 95% (95% confidence interval: 81.8%-98.8%) and 67.7% (95% confidence interval: 46.7%-82%) at age 24 months (P < .001) and 89.43% and 45% at age 48 months in the TV and NRA groups, respectively (P < .001). The choice of TV decreased from 50% (1992-1998) to 12.7% (2005-2010) (P < .005) with a nonstatistically significant increase for NT from 50% to 65%. The choice of NRA increased from 8.1% (1999-2004) to 22.7% (2005-2010) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Long-term survival outcome is determined by the choice of the treatment.

In this article, after an introductory definition of polarisation, two future scenarios are developed. In the scenario Polarised Europe, polarisation is extrapolated into the future and discussed with its serious consequences for the democratic and European consensus. The second scenario Democratised Europe shows how the concept of a relative cosmopolitanism can mitigate polarisation and what steps could possibly be taken to constructively turn it into a more democratic direction.","output":"The future of polarisation in Europe: relative cosmopolitanism and democracy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the general health of consecrated persons (CP) in the Czech Republic (CZ) and in Slovakia (SK) compared to control samples of the Czech population.

The validity of TIES relies on the correctness of matching atoms across compared pairs of ligands, laying the foundation for the transformation along an alchemical pathway. We implement a flexible topology superimposition algorithm which uses an exhaustive joint-traversal for computing the largest common component(s). The algorithm is employed to enable matching and morphing of partial rings in the TIES protocol along with a validation study using 55 transformations and five different proteins from our previous work. We find that TIES 20 with the RESP charge system, using the new superimposition algorithm, reproduces the previous results with mean unsigned error of 0.75 kcal/mol with respect to the experimental data. Enabling the morphing of partial rings decreases the size of the alchemical region in the dual-topology transformations resulting in a significant improvement in the prediction precision. We find that increasing the ensemble size from 5 to 20 replicas per  window only has a minimal impact on the accuracy. However, the non-normal nature of the relative free energy distributions underscores the importance of ensemble simulation. We further compare the results with the AM1-BCC charge system and show that it improves agreement with the experimental data by slightly over 10%. This improvement is partly due to AM1-BCC affecting only the charges of the atoms local to the mutation, which translates to even fewer morphed atoms, consequently reducing issues with sampling and therefore ensemble averaging. TIES 20, in conjunction with the enablement of ring morphing, reduces the size of the alchemical region and significantly improves the precision of the predicted free energies.","output":"TIES 20: Relative Binding Free Energy with a Flexible Superimposition Algorithm and Partial Ring Morphing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to compare the chest computed tomography (CT) findings between survivors and non-survivors with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Chest CT findings were qualitatively compared on admission and serial chest CT scans were semi-quantitively evaluated between two groups using curve estimations. On admission, significantly more bilateral (97.6% vs. 73.5%, p = 0.001) and diffuse lesions (39.0% vs. 8.4%, p < 0.001) with higher total CT score (median 10 vs. 4, p < 0.001) were observed in non-survivor group compared with survivor group. Besides, crazy-paving pattern was more predominant in non-survivor group than survivor group (39.0% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001). From the prediction of curve estimation, in survivor group total CT score increased in the first 20 days reaching a peak of 6 points and then gradually decreased for more than other 40 days (R(2) = 0.545, p < 0.001). In non-survivor group, total CT score rapidly increased over 10 points in the first 10 days and gradually increased afterwards until ARDS occurred with following death events (R(2) = 0.711, p < 0.001).

The cases in the service and the ICU, the cases that died and did not die during the follow-up in the ICU, and the vaccinated and unvaccinated cases were compared among themselves by dividing them into two groups. Results: The mean age, presence of comorbid conditions, length of stay, time elapsed after the last dose of vaccine and some laboratory values were found to be higher in ICU cases than in cases hospitalized in the service. The mean age and intubation rate were higher in the patients who died in the ICU compared to the survivors. The intubation rate was higher and the length of stay in the ICU was longer in unvaccinated cases compared to vaccinated cases. Conclusion: in our study, it was determined that the COVID 19 vaccines reduced the hospitalization of the patients in the early age groups, the length of stay in the ICU, and the admission to intubation.

However, the role of SFCA in RSV infection using strains isolated from patients is unknown. METHODS: We first used RSV clinical strains isolated from infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis to investigate the effects of in vitro SCFA-acetate treatment of human pulmonary epithelial cells. We next examined whether SCFA-acetate treatment is beneficial in a mouse model of RSV infection using clinical isolates. We sought to investigate the relationship of gut microbiota and fecal acetate with disease severity among infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis, and whether treating their respiratory epithelial cells with SCFA-acetate ex-vivo impacts viral load and ISG expression. We further treated epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with SCFA-acetate. FINDINGS: In vitro pre-treatment of A549 cells with SCFA-acetate reduced RSV infection with clinical isolates and increased the expression of RIG-I and ISG15. Animals treated with SCFA-acetate intranasally recovered significantly faster, with reduction in the RSV clinical isolates viral load, and increased lung expression of IFNB1 and the RIG-I. Experiments in RIG-I knockout A549 cells demonstrated that the protection relies on RIG-I presence. Gut microbial profile was associated with bronchiolitis severity and with acetate in stool. Increased SCFA-acetate levels were associated with increasing oxygen saturation at admission, and shorter duration of fever. Ex-vivo treatment of patients respiratory cells with SCFA-acetate reduced RSV load and increased expression of ISGs OAS1 and ISG15, and virus recognition receptors MAVS and RIG-I, but not IFNB1. These SCFA-acetate effects were not found on cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Even patients that survive, CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons C a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as an early form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Starting in January 2018, a 2-week in-person career exploration session elective was offered for third year medical students. In 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, the elective was expanded to fourth year medical students. All students were required to complete a project that addressed diagnostic error. Subjective comments were recorded, and objective measurements obtained from student evaluations. RESULTS A total of 11 sessions were held, consisting of 3 fourth year and 26 third year students. A total of 12 projects (11 groups) were completed, seven of which have been accepted for presentation at national meetings. On a 1 to 5 scale (5 highest), students rated their educational experience at a mean score of 4.61.

Two papers consider the psychosocial impact on staff working in mental health services in the UK. Most papers report cross-sectional analyses of data collected from convenience samples by self-reported surveys conducted at single times. They have limitations of generalisability, do not enable conclusions about diagnosis or causality, and many are likely to have attendant bias and noise. BJPsych Open published these papers to meet requirements for early indications of the mental health impact of COVID-19 on the public and on healthcare staff. They claim high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. We contrast these findings with selected reports of studies with different methodologies published elsewhere. We emphasise the need for longitudinal clinical studies with refined sampling and methodological rigour. We identify several longitudinal research programmes; two in this series. We advocate tuning advice offered about caring for the public and healthcare staff to the realities of their circumstances and their perceptions of need in the context of findings from further longitudinal studies.

The subjective quality of time is the measure of fullness with which one can experience a certain period of time, or the time associated with certain activity. Based on this, we aimed to develop a scale for measuring the subjective quality of time. The original version of the scale included 15 bipolar rating scales. In the process of testing and improving the psychometric characteristics of the inventory, the number of scales was reduced to 5. The one-factor model for 5 statements showed an acceptable fit to the data (multigroup model in Mplus 8.4, MLR statistic: X2(20) = 36.10, p = 0.015, CFI = 0.963, RMSEA = 0.089, 90% CI [0.039;0.134], SRMR = 0.036). The reliability of the scale (Cronbach's alpha) ranged from 0.79 to 0.87 in different samples. Several studies have focused on the construct validity of the new measure. In the study about the characteristics of self-regulation of hatha yoga practitioners, the assessment of the quality of time of yoga practice was significantly higher than the assessment of the quality of time for filling out questionnaires (Student's t-test: p<0.001;d = 1.22). In another study of psychological and behavioral responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, the scale of the subjective quality of time was offered to a sample of students as part of a set of measures. As we expected, against the background of the unfolding pandemic, assessment of the quality of time for the last month was significantly lower than for the previous year.

Since there is no effective vaccine and treatment for this virus, therefore, the only way to mitigate this infection is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing, community lockdown, quarantine, hospitalization or self-isolation and contact-tracing. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the transmission dynamics and possible control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, one of the Asian countries with a high burden of disease with more than 100,000 confirmed infected cases so far. Initially, a mathematical model without optimal control is formulated and some of the basic necessary analysis of the model, including stability results of the disease-free equilibrium is presented. It is found that the model is stable around the disease-free equilibrium both locally and globally when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Despite the basic analysis of the model, we further consider the confirmed infected COVID-19 cases documented in Pakistan from March 1 till May 28, 2020 and estimate the model parameters using the least square fitting tools from statistics and probability theory. The results show that the model output is in good agreement with the reported COVID-19 infected cases. The approximate value of the basic reproductive number based on the estimated parameters is [Formula: see text]. The effect of low (or mild), moderate, and comparatively strict control interventions like social-distancing, quarantine rate, (or contact-tracing of suspected people) and hospitalization (or self-isolation) of testing positive COVID-19 cases are shown graphically. It is observed that the most effective strategy to minimize the disease burden is the implementation of maintaining a strict social-distancing and contact-tracing to quarantine the exposed people. Furthermore, we carried out the global sensitivity analysis of the most crucial parameter known as the basic reproduction number using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques. The proposed model is then reformulated by adding the time-dependent control variables u(1)(t) for quarantine and u(2)(t) for the hospitalization interventions and present the necessary optimality conditions using the optimal control theory and Pontryagins maximum principle.

There may be no overt symptoms of renal dysfunction until about two thirds or more of the nephrons have been destroyed and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls to below 25% of normal (often in mid-late life) (Martinez-Maldonaldo et al., 1992). Once End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) has been reached, survival depends on renal replacement therapy (RRT). CKD causes hypertension and cardiovascular disease; and hypertension causes CKD. Albuminuria is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The age of onset of CKD is partly determined during fetal life. This review describes the mechanisms underlying the development of CKD in adult life that results from abnormal renal development caused by an adverse intrauterine environment. The basis of this form of CKD is thought to be mainly due to a reduction in the number of nephrons formed in utero which impacts on the age dependent decline in glomerular function. Factors that affect the risk of reduced nephron formation during intrauterine life are discussed and include maternal nutrition (malnutrition and obesity, micronutrients), smoking and alcohol, use of drugs that block the maternal renin-angiotensin system, glucocorticoid excess and maternal renal dysfunction and prematurity. Since CKD, hypertension and cardiovascular disease add to the disease burden in the community we recommend that kidney size at birth should be recorded using ultrasound and those individuals who are born premature or who have small kidneys at this time should be monitored regularly by determining GFR and albumin:creatinine clearance ratio. Furthermore, public health measures aimed at limiting the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus as well as providing advice on limiting the amount of protein ingested during a single meal, because they are all associated with increased glomerular hyperfiltration and subsequent glomerulosclerosis would be beneficial.","output":"Programming of Renal Development and Chronic Disease in Adult Life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Isolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission. Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. Purpose: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. Basic Procedures: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. Main Findings: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur.

During motion, the spatial location of these joints changes, but they must maintain their distances to one another, effectively moving semirigidly. This pattern, termed biological motion in the literature, can be used as a visual cue, enabling many animals (including humans) to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Crucially, even artificially created scrambled stimuli, with no recognizable structure but that maintains semirigid movement patterns, are perceived as animated. However, to date, biological motion perception has only been reported in vertebrates. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors, we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from nonbiological motion using point-light display stimuli. These kinds of stimuli maintain motion information while being devoid of structure. By constraining spiders on a spherical treadmill, we simultaneously presented 2 point-light displays with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned toward. Spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between biological motion and random stimuli, but curiously turned preferentially toward the latter. However, they showed no preference between biological and scrambled displays, results that match responses produced by vertebrates. Crucially, spiders turned toward the stimuli when these were only visible by the lateral eyes, evidence that this task may be eye specific. This represents the first demonstration of biological motion recognition in an invertebrate, posing crucial questions about the evolutionary history of this ability and complex visual processing in nonvertebrate systems.","output":"Perception of biological motion by jumping spiders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with a positively oriented single-stranded RNA that first appeared in December 2019.

This ideal is unfortunately quite far from reality: inadequacies in the functioning of RECs have been discussed for decades, along with reform proposals.

Even though these reforms were needed, they nonetheless raise concerns.

We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for the transition towards the centralized model and that an analysis of its impact on the research review process could provide some interesting insights into possible shortcomings of this new model.

The key and vital part of this study are noted as molecular docking against four pathogens proteins, such as Bacillus cereus, E Coli, Lanosterol 14alpha demethylase, SARS-02, and it is obtained the most expected and impactful result as an inhibitor. It is mentioned that the result of molecular docking score is -9.6 for compounds 09 and 11 against Bacillus cereus which is the highest score. But it is slightly different for E Coli -9.5 and -9.3 of compounds 10 and 07. On the other hand, it is precious and lavish work against COVID-19 protein whereas all of the tested compounds can show good and standard inhibitor with value more than -6.0, and the -9.1, 9.0, and 8.5 for compounds 09, 07, and 08, respectively. It may be revealed that methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside and its ten acylated derivatives are also found as a good inhibitor against SARS-02 protein than bacteria and fungi. Moreover, all of these are non-carcinogenic and low toxic in the case of both aquatic and non-aquatic species which says us for safe use in drug discovery.","output":"COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF METHYL alpha-D-GLUCOPYRANOSIDE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITOR AGAINST BACTERIA, FUNGI AND COVID-19 (SARS-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines reminding healthcare workers about the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of Zika virus, how to test and isolate patients suspected of carrying the Zika virus, and how to protect themselves from infection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for healthcare professionals to be fully aware of Zika virus preparedness, and response measures should an outbreak occur in Malaysia in order to quickly and efficiently contain the outbreak, ensure the safety of individual or healthcare personnel safety, as well as to prevent further spreading of the disease. This research aims to show how prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals are against Zika virus and how well can they respond during an outbreak. In total, 504 healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) from private health clinics were the target population of the four states of Malaysia where Zika cases suspected. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimating the population proportion. An additional 10% of the calculated sample size was added to compensate the non-response rate. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation provided a checklist to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for an Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals preparedness and response to the Zika outbreak. Community pharmacists are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak compared to the general practitioners in the private sector. Hence community pharmacists should attend training given by the Ministry of Health Malaysia as a continuing education, which may help them to respond during a Zika outbreak.","output":"Zika Outbreak Emergency Preparedness and Response of Malaysian Private Healthcare Professionals: Are They Ready?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring mechanical ventilation have high mortality and resource utilisation. The ability to predict which patients may require mechanical ventilation allows increased acuity of care and targeted interventions to potentially mitigate deterioration. METHODS: We included hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this single-centre retrospective observational study. Our primary outcome was mechanical ventilation or death within 24 h. As clinical decompensation is more recognisable, but less modifiable, as the prediction window shrinks, we also assessed 4, 8, and 48 h prediction windows. Model features included demographic information, laboratory results, comorbidities, medication administration, and vital signs. We created a Random Forest model, and assessed performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The model was compared with models derived from generalised estimating equations using discrimination. RESULTS: Ninety-three (23%) of 398 patients required mechanical ventilation or died within 14 days of admission. The Random Forest model predicted pending mechanical ventilation with good discrimination (C-statistic=0.858; 95% confidence interval, 0.841C0.874), which is comparable with the discrimination of the generalised estimating equation regression. Vitals sign data including SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (Random Forest Feature Importance Z-score=8.56), ventilatory frequency (5.97), and heart rate (5.87) had the highest predictive utility. In our highest-risk cohort, the number of patients needed to identify a single new case was 3.2, and for our second quintile it was 5.0. CONCLUSION: Machine learning techniques can be leveraged to improve the ability to predict which patients with COVID-19 are likely to require mechanical ventilation, identifying unrecognised bellwethers and providing insight into the constellation of accompanying signs of respiratory failure in COVID-19.","output":"Clinically applicable approach for predicting mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the education sector, including kindergartens.

General control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) are four kinases that regulate eIF2&#945; phosphorylation. MAIN BODY: In the viral infection process, dsRNA or viral proteins produced by viral proliferation activate different eIF2&#945; kinases, resulting in eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, which hinders ternary tRNAMet-GTP-eIF2 complex formation and inhibits host or viral protein synthesis. The stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex aggregates under viral infection stress to form stress granules (SGs), which encapsulate viral RNA and transcription- and translation-related proteins, thereby limiting virus proliferation. However, many viruses have evolved a corresponding escape mechanism to synthesize their own proteins in the event of host protein synthesis shutdown and SG formation caused by eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, and viruses can block the cell replication cycle through the PERK-eIF2&#945; pathway, providing a favorable environment for their own replication. Subsequently, viruses can induce host cell autophagy or apoptosis through the eIF2&#945;-ATF4-CHOP pathway.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in cartilage of osteoarthritis patients and normal human cartilage were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Osteoarthritis cell model was induced by IL-1? and TNF-&#945;, and the expression changes of circTMBIM6, miR-27a and MMP13 in the in vitro model were detected. In addition, the in vitro regulation of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a in osteoarthritis was verified by transfection of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a plasmids, and the regulation of miR-27a on MMP13 was also verified. The dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) method was used to analyze the secretion and formation of soluble glycosaminoglycan sulfate (sGAG), and the effects of circTMBIM6 and miR-27a chondrocytes were evaluated. RESULTS: The expression levels of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis were higher than that of normal group, while the expression level of miR-195 in cartilage tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was lower. After IL-1? and TNF-&#945; treatment, the expression of circTMBIM6 and MMP13 in chondrocytes increased, while the expression of miR-27a decreased.

The patient had a favourable evolution and was discharged 48 h after admission. DISCUSSION: Flecainide toxicity is uncommon and needs timely recognition and treatment; it is usually secondary to overdose and renal or hepatic failure. In our case, toxicity was associated with GB use, probably by inhibition of CYP2D6 which is the main enzyme associated with the metabolism of flecainide.

However, the impact on traumatic injury is relatively unknown. This study aims to characterize patterns of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic at a Level I Trauma Center. MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of adult trauma patients from March through June, in the years 2018 through 2020. Primary outcome was the number of trauma activations (volume). Secondary outcomes included activation level, mechanism of injury, mortality rate, and length of stay, and other demographic background. Trauma patterns of the 2018 and 2019 periods were combined as historical control, and compared to patterns of the biweekly-matched period of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,187 patients were included in analysis (Pre-COVID n = 1,572; COVID n = 615). Results were significant for decreased trauma volume but longer length of stay during COVID cohort, and for an increased proportion of males. No significant difference was found for other demographic variables, trauma mechanisms, or severity. Trauma volume patterns mirrored COVID rates in the state. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in trauma volume, other trauma patterns including severity and mechanism remained unchanged during the COVID-19 period. The decreased volume was not associated with a markedly lower clinical workload, change in team structure, or provider coverage re-distribution.

The main purpose of this two-year follow-up case study was, therefore, to examine whether syllable complexity may be considered as a robust indicator in CAS and whether it can explain the persistence of errors and, if so, at what age. This was tested in a boy followed up annually from age 5 to 7 who was administered a narrative task. Data analyses used the Phon program to estimate accuracies of different syllabic structures, phones, singleton and cluster consonants. Overall, the findings suggest that this child experienced difficulty producing syllabic structure commensurately with the level of complexity of the target structures. Notably, the presence of syllable planning/sequencing deficit found in French data clearly supports the hypotheses according to which (a) there is a relationship between the level of complexity of syllabic structures and their simplification and (b) the persistence of errors on the most complex syllables remains, becoming a robust indicator for identifying CAS from other speech disorders. Further cross-language investigations on syllable complexity in CAS are needed to design better assessments and to plan efficient intervention.","output":"Simplification of syllable structure in childhood apraxia of speech: a 2-year follow-up French case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are mesenchymal precursors of various origins, with well-known immunomodulatory effects. Natural killer (NK) cells, the major cells of the innate immune system, are critical for the antitumor and antiviral defenses; however, in certain cases, they may be the main culprits in the pathogenesis of some NK-related conditions such as autoimmunities and hematological malignancies. On the other hand, these cells seem to be the major responders in beneficial phenomena like graft versus leukemia. Substantial data suggest that MSCs can variably affect NK cells and can be affected by these cells. Accordingly, acquiring a profound understanding of the crosstalk between MSCs and NK cells and the involved mechanisms seems to be a necessity to develop therapeutic approaches based on such interactions. Therefore, in this study, we made a thorough review of the existing literature on the interactions between MSCs and NK cells with a focus on the underlying mechanisms. The current knowledge herein suggests that MSCs possess a great potential to be used as tools for therapeutic targeting of NK cells in disease context and that preconditioning of MSCs, as well as their genetic manipulation before administration, may provide a wider variety of options in terms of eliciting more specific and desirable therapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the effects of MSCs on NK cells is still in its infancy, and further studies with well-defined conditions are warranted herein.","output":"The mechanisms of cellular crosstalk between mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells: Therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown enforced by several countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic induced severe changes in light exposure and the social factors related to daily routine","output":"Effects of Social Isolation on Human Sleeand Chronotype During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objective There has been a documented rise of racism and hostility towards Asian Pacific Islanders (API) groups across the nation. With the anticipated population-level increase in mental health issues as a result of COVID-19, API college students are an especially high risk group to consider as API young and emerging adults tend to report similar levels of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with their peers, but underutilize service relative to their level of need. The objective of this presentation is to understand the impact of the pandemic on API mental health using large-scale data, by evaluating pre-pandemic (Fall 2019), initial months of the pandemic (March-May 2020) and recent pandemic (Fall 2020) trends in API mental health and treatment utilization, as well as discussing the public health implications in higher education settings for API student populations. Study Design Data comes from 3 administrations of the Healthy Minds Study: Sept-Dec 2019 (n=33,372 students across 32 campuses), March-May 2020 (n=12,039 students across 7 campuses) and Sept-Dec 2020 (n=15,949 students across 28 campuses). This data represents the largest and most comprehensive nationally recognized assessment of API student mental health symptoms, help-seeking behavior and experiences of discrimination directly related to COVID-19. We used bi-variate analyses to compare mental health symptoms and treatment utilization across API students who identified as international students and those who reported US citizenship or permanent residency in the US. We used cross-sectional logistic regression models to assess the association between discrimination and mental health symptoms and help-seeking behavior. Population Studied Young and emerging adults who identify as Asian or Pacific Islander and are enrolled at a college or university in the United States. Principal Findings Comparing Fall 2019 to Fall 2020, we found that API non-international students reported a 23% increase in severe anxiety, a 10% increase in moderate or severe anxiety, and a 9% increase in severe depression;API international students reported a 16% increase in severe depression and a 12% increase in severe anxiety. In Spring 2020, 22% of API students experienced COVID-related discrimination or hostility (25% in Fall 2020). COVID-related discrimination or hostility was associated with greater odds of meeting the criteria for one or more clinically significant mental health conditions [aOR: 1.83;95% CI: 1.35-2.49;p=0.000]. Treatment utilization among Asian students with at least one clinically significant mental health condition decreased by 26% between Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. Conclusions Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, both API international and non-international students reported increases in mental health symptoms and decreases in treatment utilization. Our analyses also suggest that COVID-related discrimination is correlated with greater odds of clinically significant mental health symptoms as well decreased help-seeking. Implications for Policy or Practice The racialization of COVID-19 has the potential to produce long-lasting effects on attitudes towards API populations. Culturally tailored psychoeducation, collaborative care models and active recruitment of diverse and culturally-competent mental health providers are potential avenues to facilitate help-seeking. Given the mental health challenges that API populations are facing, it will be crucial to make an active effort towards resolving mental health treatment disparities already looming in API communities.","output":"Stop Asian Hate: The Mental Health Impact of Racial Discrimination Among Asian Pacific Islander Young and Emerging Adults during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 outbreak negatively impacted the mental health and emotions of many individuals.

However, empirical evidence of the extent of this impact in ONDO is lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID_19 epidemic on the utilization of hospital services & determine the existence of community transmission of COVID_19 in ONDO state using a proxy Respiratory Tract Infections, RTIs. Methods The study used resident clinicians to conduct peer review of hospital utilization records. The review was retrospectively for the months of January to May for four consecutive years (2018 to 2021). The team reviewed outpatient records from 11 health facilities before the advent of COVID_19 (2018) to date (2021). Thousands of such records were scrutinized to reveal six parameters: number of antenatal visits;number of live births and total number of infants served BCG;number RDTs conducted for Malaria, number of RTIs seen and total number of patients for all other illnesses. Results Results showed a decline in all parameters investigated except RTIs. Indeed, the proportion of RTIs - related hospital visits increased by about 22.8%. Discussion The decline in the utilization of hospital services is expected given the lock down measures implemented to halt transmission of COVID_19 that makes it difficult to access health facilities. The rise in the incidence of RTIs may probably be that, they were COVID cases that were undetected due to limited COVID_19 testing capacity. Conclusion The study concludes that COVID_19 epidemic impacted negatively on all aspect of hospital services except RTIs. The increment is statistically significant. As the most prominent of all symptoms of COVID_19 presents as respiratory tract disorder, a continued rise in RTIs despite declining rates of confirmed COVID19 cases in the state at the moment suggests that, theres an ongoing community transmission.","output":"A rapid assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of hospital services in Ondo State of South Western Nigeria (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Although the gut microbiota (GM) are associated with various diseases, their role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains uncharacterized. Further study is urgently needed to expose the real relationship between GM and GDM. METHODS: We performed a prospective study in 33 pregnant Chinese individuals [15, GDM; 18, normal glucose tolerance (NGT)] to observe the fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at 24C28 weeks of gestational age after a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the relationships between the GM and GDM clinical parameters. RESULTS: Sequencing showed no difference in the microbiota alpha diversity but a significant difference in the beta diversity between the GDM and NGT groups, with the relative abundances of Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium colinum, and Streptococcus infantis being higher in the GDM group (P < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results validated the putative bacterial markers of R. bromii and S. infantis. Moreover, a strong positive correlation was found between S. infantis and blood glucose levels after adjusting for body mass index (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Three abnormally expressed intestinal bacteria (R. bromii, C. colinum, and S. infantis) were identified in GDM patients. S. infantis may confer an increased risk of GDM.

However, no pharmacodynamic data are available to guide dosing or justify this breakpoint. METHODS: The murine neutropenic thigh infection model was utilized to determine minocycline pharmacodynamics against four S. maltophilia through dose ranging and fractionation studies. The efficacy of a human simulated regimen (HSR) of 100a? mg IV q12h was tested against 17 isolates with a range of minocycline MICs. Monte Carlo simulation was employed to assess the PTA for achieving defined pharmacodynamic thresholds in critically ill patients. RESULTS: The pharmacodynamic index best correlated with reductions in cfu was fAUC/MIC (R2a??=a??0.376). The composite fAUC/MIC required for stasis and 1 log10 reduction was 9.6 and 23.6, respectively. The minocycline 100a? mg q12h HSR yielded no bacterial reduction at MICs 1a? mg/L and mixed efficacy at 0.5a? mg/L. Monte Carlo simulation of minocycline 200a? mg IV q12h achieved the 1 log10 kill threshold with PTAs of 93% and 51.7% at MICs of 0.5 and 1a? mg/L, respectively, but 0.1% at the current breakpoint of 4a? mg/L.

Current standard of care includes debridement, topical antibiotics, and weight off-loading-still resulting in low rates of healing. Previous small-scale research has indicated that repeated remote ischemic conditioning (rRIC) is a novel modality that delivers significantly higher DFU healing rates. This proof-of-concept study was performed to expand the research on the utility of rRIC as an adjunctive treatment in the healing of chronic DFUs. Forty subjects (41 wounds) received rRIC treatment three times weekly in addition to standard of care for 12 weeks. Subjects that did not heal in this time frame but had a significant reduction in wound size were eligible to continue for an 8-week extension period. By the end of the extension period, 31 of the 41 DFU wounds (75.6%) in this study were determined to be healed. This compares favourably to the 25-30% standard of care average healing rate. For additional comparison, another group of patients receiving standard of care alone, by the same investigator, was selected and matched by wound size at baseline and wound location. For this matching cohort, after 20 weeks of treatment, only 15 of the 41 DFU comparison wounds (36.6%) were determined to be healed, in line with other standard of care results. In the rRIC treatment group, the 10 wounds that did not heal, experienced an average reduction in wound area of 54.3%.

We share our institute's policy and our department's attempt to resume non-emergent surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected details of all patients operated under department of neurosurgery since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in India and categorized them into lockdown and unlock groups for comparison. COVID-19 tests done in these patients were also analyzed. We also compared our surgical volume with the number of COVID-19 cases in the state. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients (97 males, 51 females) with mean age of 37.8 years (range-2 months-82 years) underwent surgery in our department during the study period. The operative volume per week increased by 37% during the unlock period as compared to lockdown period. The proportion of elective/non-emergent surgeries increased from 11.3% during lockdown to 34.7% during the unlock period (P = 0.0037). During lockdown period, number of surgeries declined steadily as the number of COVID-19 cases rose in the state (rs(8) = ?0.914, P = 0.000). Whereas there was a trend toward increased number of cases done per week despite increase in the number of cases in the state during the unlock period. During the unlocking process, in-patient department admissions and surgeries performed per month increased (P = 0.0000) and this increase was uniform across all specialties. COVID-19 test was done (preoperatively or postoperatively) for all surgeries during unlock period compared to 12 (22.6%) surgeries during lockdown period.

An alternative is to supply plain alcohols (EtOH and IPA) or sodium hypochlorite (SH). AIM: There are few data showing the efficacy of multiple concentrations of EtOH, IPA, and SH on a human coronavirus (HCoV) dried on surfaces using short contact times. METHODS: Multiple concentrations of EtOH, IPA, and SH to inactivate high numbers of HCoV under real-life conditions were tested. High concentrations of infectious HCoV were dried on porcelain and ceramic tiles, then treated with multiple concentrations of the alcohols for contact times of 15 sec, 30 sec, and 1 min. Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended three concentrations of SH were also tested. Reductions in titres were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID(50)) assay. FINDINGS: Concentrations of EtOH and IPA from 62% to 80% were very efficient at inactivating high numbers of HCoV dried on tile surfaces even with a 15 sec contact time. Concentrations of 95% dehydrated the virus, allowing infectious virus to survive. The CDC recommended 1/10 and 1/50 dilutions of SH were efficient at inactivating high numbers of HCoV dried on tile surfaces, whereas, a 1/100 dilution had substantially lower activity.

However, there are still difficulties concerning effective triangulation and countertraction. The study's purpose was to clarify the usefulness of the colon-lifting technique (CLT) in SILS for colorectal cancer. METHODS SILS was performed for cancer (cT2N0 or less) of the right-sided colon (near the ileocecum), sigmoid, or rectosigmoid. The SILS? Port was used for transumbilical access. A suture string was inserted through the abdominal wall and passed through the mesocolon. The colon was retracted anteriorly and fixed to the abdominal wall. The main mesenteric vessels were placed under tension. Lymph node dissection was performed by medial approach. Short-term surgical outcomes and access port costs were compared between SILS (using CLT) and the standard multiport technique (MPT). The two groups were case-matched by propensity scoring. Analyzed variables included preoperative Dukes stage and tumor location. RESULTS From June 2009 to April 2011, 27 patients underwent SILS, and from April 2005 to April 2011, 85 patients underwent MPT. Propensity scoring generated 23 matched patients per group for SILS versus MPT comparisons. There were no significant differences in operating time, blood loss, early complications, postoperative analgesic frequency, or length of hospital stay. One MPT patient was converted to open surgery (4.5%); no SILS patients were converted. There were no significant differences in the length of distal cut margin and the number of harvested lymph nodes, except incision length (SILS vs. MPT: 33 vs. 55 mm, P < 0.001). Significant differences favored SILS in access instrument cost (SILS vs. MPT: 62,761 vs. 77,130 Japanese yen, P < 0.001).

However, despite an urgent need for current methods to monitor Abs grafting process and orientation, existing methods are still either cumbersome and/or limited. In this work, we propose a new simple and rapid analytical approach to evaluate antibody orientation and density on magnetic beads. This approach relies on the cleavage by IdeS, a highly specific protease for human immunoglobulin G (hIgG), of immobilized antibodies. The F(ab)(2) and Fc fragments could be then accurately quantified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-coupled to fluorescent detection (FLD), and the ratio of these fragments was used to give insight on the IgG orientation at the bead surface. Four different commercially available magnetic beads, bearing carboxyl groups, tosyl groups, streptavidin, or protein G on their surface have been used in this study. Results obtained showed that this approach ensures reliable information on hIgG orientation and bead surface coverage. Protein G magnetic beads demonstrated an optimal orientation of antibodies for antigen capture (75% of accessible F(ab)(2) fragment) compared to tosylactivated, carboxylated, and streptavidin ones. Capture efficiency of the different functionalized beads towards human TNF- immunocapture, a biomarker of inflammation, has been also compared. Protein G beads provided a more efficient capture compared to other beads. In the future, this approach could be applied to any type of surface and beads to assess hIgG coverage and orientation after any type of immobilization.

To guide prior preparations for future application of pandemic management strategies, the paper consolidates lessons learned in implementation of situated strategies and proposes preparations at the national level for elimination, at the local/community level for suppression, and at the regional level for mitigation. Highlights: Lessons of COVID-19 (coronavirus) chart sustainable management of future pandemics Epidemiological determinants and their mechanisms of impact are listed Knowledge about elimination, suppression and mitigation strategies is consolidated A quantified SWOT and Cartesian plane enable selecting context-specific strategies Preparations for future elimination, suppression and mitigation are listed. ? 2021 The Institute of Urban Sciences.","output":"Meta-synthesis of COVID-19 lessons: charting sustainable management of future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic is causing important loss of life, knowledge of the effects of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus on human cells is currently limited. Investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between viral and host proteins can provide a better understanding of the mechanisms exploited by the virus and enable the identification of potential drug targets. We therefore performed an in-depth computational analysis of the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins in infected HEK293 cells published by Gordon et al. to reveal processes that are potentially affected by the virus and putative protein binding sites. Specifically, we performed a set of network-based functional and sequence motif enrichment analyses on SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins and on a PPI network generated by supplementing viral-host PPIs with known interactions. Using a novel implementation of our GoNet algorithm, we identified 329 Gene Ontology terms for which the SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins are significantly clustered in the network. Furthermore, we present a novel protein sequence motif discovery approach, LESMoN-Pro, that identified 9 amino acid motifs for which the associated proteins are clustered in the network. Together, these results provide insights into the processes and sequence motifs that are putatively implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and could lead to potential therapeutic targets.","output":"Computational identification of human biological processes and protein sequence motifs putatively targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins using protein-protein interaction networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The urgency to develop vaccines against Covid-19 is putting pressure on the long and expensive development timelines that are normally required for development of lifesaving vaccines.

Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor -like (GFRAL) is an endogenous receptor for GDF15 detected selectively in the brain. GDF15 is not normally expressed in the tissue but is prominently induced by injury. Serum levels of GDF15 are also increased by aging and in response to cellular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. It acts as an inflammatory marker and plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative processes. Identified as a new heart-derived endocrine hormone that regulates body growth, GDF15 has a local cardioprotective role, presumably due to its autocrine/paracrine properties: antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic. GDF15 expression is highly induced in cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion and in the heart within hours after myocardial infarction (MI). Recent studies show associations between GDF15, inflammation, and cardiac fibrosis during heart failure and MI. However, the reason for this increase in GDF15 production has not been clearly identified. Experimental and clinical studies support the potential use of GDF15 as a novel therapeutic target (1) by modulating metabolic activity and (2) promoting an adaptive angiogenesis and cardiac regenerative process during cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we comment on new aspects of the biology of GDF15 as a cardiac hormone and show that GDF15 may be a predictive biomarker of adverse cardiac events.","output":"GDF15 and Cardiac Cells: Current Concepts and New Insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Globally, reducing job burnout among healthcare workers is considered a basic healthcare policy goal. Emotional intelligence, as an essential protective factor against psychosocial risks and a measurable positive psychological resource, still receives less attention in the process of reducing job burnout among healthcare workers. This study aims to explore the level of job burnout among healthcare workers who are victims of workplace violence in China, to examine the influence of emotional intelligence on job burnout among healthcare workers, and to verify the mediating role of workplace violence; furthermore, providing a new perspective for health organizations and hospital administrators in order to relieve the level of job burnout and workplace violence among healthcare workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was used to collect data from six tertiary public hospitals in three provinces (cities) in Eastern (Shandong and Tianjin) and Western (Gansu) China in 2018, which are large healthcare sites providing care to patients upon referral from primary and secondary hospitals. A total of 2,450 questionnaires were distributed, with 2,061 valid questionnaires and a valid return rate of 88.95%. Of these, 825 healthcare workers had experienced workplace violence, accounting for 40.03% of the sample. A descriptive analysis, univariate analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and mediated regression analysis were used to assess the level of job burnout among healthcare workers who are victims of violence, the effect of emotional intelligence on job burnout, and the mediating role of workplace violence. RESULTS: The mean job burnout score of the healthcare personnel who were victims of violence was 35.56, with 70% suffering from moderate and high burnout. The emotional intelligence of healthcare workers is significantly negatively correlated with the degree of job burnout (Emotional exhaustion: r = 0.18, p < 0.01, Depersonalization: r = 0.24, p < 0.01, Reduced personal achievement: r = 0.24, p < 0.01) and workplace violence frequency (r = ?0.22, p < 0.01). Further, workplace violence has a partial mediating effect on emotional intelligence and the two dimensions of job burnout (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to combine emotional intelligence level, experiences of workplace violence, and job burnout levels of healthcare workers. We suggest that improving the emotional intelligence of healthcare staff has practical significance in reducing the level of job burnout directly and will reduce the incidence of burnout by reducing the frequency of violence (especially for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). We provide specific and effective strategies for developing and guiding healthcare workers in the healthcare sector based on emotional intelligence.","output":"The Influence of Emotional Intelligence on Job Burnout of Healthcare Workers and Mediating Role of Workplace Violence: A Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to analyze the requirements for stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships in times of sustainability crisis. Referring to the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis that has sensitized consumers and other stakeholders to corporate responsibility for social and sustainability issues, a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration is developed from which implications for designing the potential, process and result quality are derived.Design/methodology/approachIn this conceptual paper, design options for stakeholder integration are derived from open innovation and service management research. Specific crisis-related determinants of stakeholder integration are derived from current corporate social responsibility (CSR) and crisis research taking into account the opportunities and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design options and crisis-related determinants are then combined to a conceptual framework for stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Based on this framework, research propositions are derived that provide insights into the design of the potential, process and result quality of stakeholder integration.FindingsThis paper shows that the COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as a sustainability crisis, which places special entrepreneurial demands on stakeholder integration in sustainability project partnerships. The pandemic offers potential for integrating a large number of stakeholders and has emphasized the need for integrating a broad range of stakeholders. Higher skepticism of stakeholders toward companies' CSR engagement in the pandemic has raised stakeholder demands for early integration. Higher skepticism and CSR involvement have rendered active forms of integration even more relevant, which, however, should still be adapted to the respective stakeholder prerequisites. The pandemic has increased the need for constant and comprehensive exchange of data on project results between stakeholders and the project leading organization. Measurement of target achievement can be promoted by establishing stakeholder commitment with regard to the target measures on the collective and relationship levels of the partnership. Finally, the pandemic has reinforced the need for more dialogical forms of communicating sustainability project results.Originality/valueSolving problems and exploiting opportunities in times of crisis require a high degree of entrepreneurship and creative leadership in order to gain new ideas and overcome resource deficits. Sustainability project partnerships in which various stakeholders contribute resources and knowledge to collaborate on idea development and finding solutions to sustainability issues are suitable for this. However, previous approaches to stakeholder integration in open innovation and service management research largely neglect the crisis context and only a few are related to sustainability. In CSR and crisis research, stakeholder-related approaches to coping with crises tend to be underrepresented, and the comprehensive concept of stakeholder integration has so far hardly been considered as an approach to crisis management. By taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic as a sustainability crisis, this paper provides new impulses for the integration of stakeholders in sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis. Recommendations for the design of the potential, process and result quality are derived, which provide insights for project leaders and stakeholders alike. In addition, implications for public policymakers are derived, who are assigned an increasingly active role in the pandemic and who can contribute to the success of sustainability project partnerships by setting suitable framework conditions. The developed concept can be expanded to include further company-related determinants and offers a starting point for empirical analysis in the still underexplored research fields of sustainability-oriented relationship marketing and sustainability crises.","output":"Sustainability project partnerships in times of crisis: conceptual framework and implications for stakeholder integration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper stresses its base contribution on a new SIR-type model including direct and fomite transmission as well as the effect of distinct household structures The model derivation is modulated by several mechanistic processes inherent from typical airborne diseases The notion of minimum contact radius is included in the direct transmission, facilitating the arguments on physical distancing As fomite transmission heavily relates to former-trace of sneezes, the vector field of the system naturally contains an integral kernel with time delay indicating the contribution of undetected and non-quarantined asymptomatic cases in accumulating the historical contamination of surfaces We then increase the complexity by including the different transmission routines within and between households For airborne diseases, within-household interactions play a significant role in the propagation of the disease rendering countrywide effect Two steps were taken to include the effect of household structure The first step subdivides the entire compartments (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, recovered, death) into the household level and different infection rates for the direct transmission within and between households were distinguished Under predefined conditions and assumptions, the governing system on household level can be raised to the community level The second step then raises the governing system to the country level, where the final state variables estimate the total individuals from all compartments in the country Two key attributes related to the household structure (number of local households and number of household members) effectively classify countries to be of low or high risk in terms of effective disease propagation The basic reproductive number is calculated and its biological meaning is invoked properly The numerical methods for solving the DIDE-system and the parameter estimation problem were mentioned Our optimal model solutions are in quite good agreement with datasets of COVID-19 active cases and related deaths from Germany and Sri Lanka in early infection, allowing us to hypothesize several unobservable situations in the two countries Focusing on extending minimum contact radius and reducing the intensity of individual activities, we were able to synthesize the key parameters telling what to practice","output":"An epidemic model integrating direct and fomite transmission as well as household structure applied to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected every aspect of medical practice and has all but ceased clinical, translational and basic science research.

We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life, physical and psychosocial wellbeing of patients (being) treated for breast cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted within a prospective, multicentre cohort of breast cancer patients and survivors (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, an extra survey was sent to 1,595 participants, including validated EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 and HADS questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA pre-COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was assessed using mixed model analysis, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1,051 patients and survivors (65.9%) completed the survey; 31.1% (n = 327) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistically significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 [SD = 18.7] to 77.9 [SD = 17.3], p < .001), and 505 (48.0%, 95%CI = 45.0 to 51.1%) reported moderate to severe loneliness. Small improvements were observed in QoL, physical-, social- and role functioning.

CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer patients and survivors were less likely to contact physicians and experienced a deterioration in their emotional functioning. Patients undergoing active treatment reported a substantial drop in social functioning. One in two reported loneliness that was moderate or severe.

Entrepreneurs experience an intensive emotional crisis when their ventures fail, and this deleterious impact, including stress and emotional pain, may prevent failed entrepreneurs (FEs) from restarting; hence, how they cope with failure has received increased attention in recent years. However, most of the extant literature focuses on success rather than failure, and there is very limited literature on how FEs cope with the psychological and emotional crisis caused by failure. This study focuses on FEs use of optimism and defensive pessimism as coping strategies within the mental simulation theory with respect to their re-entry intentions. It examines the impact of career ambition and public self-awareness on optimism, of the fear of failure (FoF) and self-doubt, on defensive pessimism, and of coping humor as a moderator. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the data of 277 Korean FEs who have actual entrepreneurial failure experiences and actively prepared for their re-entry. The results show that career ambitions and public self-awareness have an impact on optimism, and FoF and self-doubt lead to defensive pessimism. Coping humor also has a moderating effect on the path from defensive pessimism to the intention to re-enter. This study advances the literature on coping mechanisms that FEs employ to manage the negative impact of failure and prepare for their subsequent re-entry. Its theoretical model, based on the mental simulation theory combined with social comparison theory, provides a possible integrative framework that includes both the pervasively held view of entrepreneurs optimism related to overconfidence and their defensive pessimism related to their vulnerability due to their ventures failure.

By coupling a light absorbing particle to a fluid droplet we produce a colloidal chimera that transforms optical power into propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to operate for a long duration (days) and remain active when crowded, forming a high density fluid phase. We find that above a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense swimmer phase can re-arrange to spontaneously corral the passive particles. We derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration of the micro-swimmers.","output":"Cooperation in a fluid swarm of fuel-free micro-swimmers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a modelling approach for simulating mechanical ventilators for intensive care units (ICUs) The shortage of ventilators during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has focused attention on their design and performance The proposed modelling approach consists in using the Mathworks?

METHODS: Compartmental models were used to estimate deaths under different combinations of ICU and ward care required and received in England up to late April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information and organisations collating COVID-19 data. A sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent increased mortality due to insufficient ICU or general ward bed capacity. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, 'Optimistic', 'Middling' and 'Pessimistic', were modelled and compared with the subsequent observations to the 3rd February. RESULTS: The key output was the demand and capacity model described. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in the 'Optimistic' scenario. Several of the 'Middling' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths-up to 597 deaths (0.6% increase) with a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. All the 'Pessimistic' scenario applications resulted in excess deaths, ranging from 49,178 (17.0% increase) for a 20% increase in ward bed availability, to 103,735 (35.8% increase) for a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability. These scenarios took no account of the emergence of the new, more transmissible, variant of concern (b.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is increased when hospital demand exceeds available capacity. No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the 'Optimistic' scenario. The 'Middling' scenario could result in some excess deaths-up to a 0.7% increase relative to the total number of deaths. The 'Pessimistic' scenario would have resulted in significant excess deaths. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,178 (17% increase) and 103,735 (35.8% increase). Given the new variant, the pessimistic scenario appeared increasingly likely and could have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths. In the event, it would appear that capacity was not breached at any stage at a national level with no excess deaths. it will remain unclear if minor local capacity breaches resulted in any small number of excess deaths.","output":"Construction of a demand and capacity model for intensive care and hospital ward beds, and mortality from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Portuguese Navy gave financial support to THEMIS project under the aim of the development of a decision support system to get optimal decisions in short time in a disaster context, optimizing the decision chain, allowing to get a better performance of tasks execution allowing a reduction of costs.

They proposed a system that prioritize certain teams for specific incidents taking into account the importance of each team that acts in case of emergency.

To justify this suggestion we have used hierarchical classification, allowing to identify different padrons for experts with the same experience. Also discriminant analysis and multidimensional scaling revealed to be adequate techniques for this issue. We can classify the experience of each expert evaluating the similarity/distance between the individuals in the group of proposed experts and compare with the number of consensus presented.

CHIKV uses Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as insect vectors. Human infections can develop arthralgia and myalgia, which results in debilitating pain for weeks, months, and even years after acute infection. No therapeutic treatments or vaccines currently exist for many alphaviruses, including CHIKV. Targeting the phagocytosis of CHIKV by macrophages after mosquito transmission plays an important role in early productive viral infection in humans, and could reduce viral replication and/or symptoms. METHODS: To better characterize the transcriptional response of macrophages during early infection, we generated RNA-sequencing data from a CHIKV-infected human macrophage cell line at eight or 24 hours post-infection (hpi), together with mock-infected controls. We then calculated differential gene expression, enriched functional annotations, modulated intracellular signaling pathways, and predicted therapeutic drugs from these sequencing data. RESULTS: We observed 234 pathways were significantly affected 24 hpi, resulting in six potential pharmaceutical treatments to modulate the affected pathways. A subset of significant pathways at 24 hpi includes AGE-RAGE, Fc epsilon RI, Chronic myeloid leukemia, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and Ras signaling. We found that the MAPK1 and MAPK3 proteins are shared among this subset of pathways and that Telmisartan and Dasatinib are strong candidates for repurposed small molecule therapeutics that target human processes. The results of our analysis can be further characterized in the wet lab to contribute to the development of host-based prophylactics and therapeutics.","output":"Chikungunya virus time course infection of human macrophages reveals intracellular signaling pathways relevant to repurposed therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) bore the greatest burden of COVID-19 in the United States early in the pandemic.

METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of all patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 test between March 5 and April 9, 2020, with follow up through April 16, 2020. The primary outcomes were a positive test, hospitalization, and death. Demographics and comorbidities were also assessed. RESULTS: 22254 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2. 13442 (61%) were positive; among those, the median age was 52.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 39.5-64.5), 7481 (56%) were male, 3518 (26%) were Black, and 4593 (34%) were Hispanic. Nearly half (4669, 46%) had at least one chronic disease (27% diabetes, 30% hypertension, and 21% cardiovascular disease). Of those testing positive, 6248 (46%) were hospitalized.

There is growing optimism that social distancing restrictions and face mask requirements could be eased with widespread vaccine adoption soon. Methods: We developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission for the four most severely affected states (New York, Texas, Florida, and California). We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness and coverage required to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic in scenarios when social contact was to return to pre-pandemic levels and face mask use was reduced. Daily and cumulative COVID-19 infection and death cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center and used for model calibration. Results: Without a vaccine, the spread of COVID-19 could be suppressed in these states by maintaining strict social distancing measures and face mask use levels. But relaxing social distancing restrictions to the pre-pandemic level without changing the current face mask use would lead to a new COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in 0.8-4 million infections and 15,000-240,000 deaths across these four states over the next 12 months. In this scenario, introducing a vaccine would partially offset this negative impact even if the vaccine effectiveness and coverage are relatively low. However, if face mask use is reduced by 50%, a vaccine that is only 50% effective (weak vaccine) would require coverage of 55-94% to suppress the epidemic in these states. A vaccine that is 80% effective (moderate vaccine) would only require 32-57% coverage to suppress the epidemic. In contrast, if face mask usage stops completely, a weak vaccine would not suppress the epidemic, and further major outbreaks would occur. A moderate vaccine with coverage of 48-78% or a strong vaccine (100% effective) with coverage of 33-58% would be required to suppress the epidemic. Delaying vaccination rollout for 1-2 months would not substantially alter the epidemic trend if the current interventions are maintained. Conclusions: The degree to which the US population can relax social distancing restrictions and face mask use will depend greatly on the effectiveness and coverage of a potential COVID-19 vaccine if future epidemics are to be prevented. Only a highly effective vaccine will enable the US population to return to life as it was before the pandemic.","output":"Projected COVID-19 epidemic in the United States in the context of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine and implications for social distancing and face mask use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this case report, we present the case of a 17-year-old stroke patient suffering from coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.

In Peru, MI is the second leading cause of death at the national level, with a mortality rate that exceeds 10% in the hospital setting. The study aims to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in tertiary care facilities belonging to the Peruvian public health system. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a prospective, observational, multicenter study, with baseline and two follow-up assessments: at admission to the health service, and 30 days and 12 months after admission. This multicenter study will be conducted in 27 hospitals located in the main cities of Peru. The patients included in the study will be over 18 years of age, of either sex, and will have been admitted to the health facility with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the cumulative in-hospital mortality of patients at 30 days and 12 months of follow-up, and the log-rank test will be used to evaluate the differences between the survival curves between reperfused and non-reperfused patients. Subsequently, to evaluate the risk factors for successful reperfusion and cardiovascular adverse events, generalized linear models of the binomial family with log link function will be used to estimate the bivariate and multivariate relative risk (RR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals. This project was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the National Cardiovascular Institute (Instituto Nacional Cardiovascular Carlos Alberto Peschiera CarrilloINCOR [in Spanish]; Approval report 21/2019-CEI). DISCUSSION: Among the strengths, the observational design will allow the inclusion of a large sample of patients, which will significantly contribute to the knowledge base on STEMI in Peru. It should be noted that this study is the first to examine the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of STEMI in high-resolution hospital centers in Peru with follow-up one year after the event, providing knowledge of these observable characteristics in daily clinical routine. Likewise, the multicenter nature of the study will increase the external validity of the findings. In terms of limitations, the observational design of the study can only describe associations and not causality.

To date, no reports compare the efficacy of spinal anesthesia (SA) with that of GA for laparoscopic hernia repairs. The purpose of this study was to compare the surgical outcome of TEP inguinal hernia repair performed when the patient was treated under SA with that performed under GA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2015 and July 2016, 50 patients were prospectively randomized to either the GA TEP group (Group I) or the SA TEP group (Group II). Propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium, sevoflurane, and tracheal intubation were used for GA. Hyperbaric bupivacaine (15 mg) and fentanyl (10 g) were used for SA to achieve a sensorial level of T3. Intraoperative events related to SA, operative and anesthesia times, postoperative complications, and pain scores were recorded. Each patient was asked to evaluate the anesthetic technique by using a direct questionnaire filled in 3 months after the operation. RESULTS All the procedures were completed by the allocated method of anesthesia as there were no conversions from SA to GA. Pain was significantly less for 1 h (P<0.0001) and 4 h (P=0.002) after the procedure for the SA and GA groups, respectively. There was no difference between the two groups regarding complications, hospital stay, recovery, or surgery time. Generally, patients were more satisfied with SA than GA (P<0.020).

We compared SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequence from Italian patients with sequences in Coronaviridae ViPR database, to identify elements and TF binding sites that were present uniquely in the Italian viral sequence. Results: Several TFs were induced by IRFs, others were induced by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and by un-phosphorylated ISGF3 that was found to promote the transcription of several viral open reading frame. These data shed light on SARS-CoV2 dependence from the host transcription machinery associated to interferon-related antiviral response. We found binding sites for 11 TF present only in sequence of virus infecting humans and among these IRF8, IRF4, GLIS2, POU4F2 that were expressed in response to the viral infection and induced by interferon. POU4F2 binds in ORF1ab promoter;IRF8, and IRF4 both bind within the ORF1ab gene. Conclusions: Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can exploit the interferon-related host response, inducing the expression of genes by host TF involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, thus facilitating its own replication cycle.These data strengthen our knowledge about the transcription and replicative activity of the virus and could pave the way for new targets drug design.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 could exploit human transcription factors involved in Interferon-mediated response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put a strain on regular healthcare worldwide.

We aimed to develop colorimetric LAMP based on a phenol red indicator and validate it on various thalassemia genotypes. METHOD: Colorimetric LAMP assays for detecting (0)-thalassemia 3.5- and 45-kb deletions were developed and validated on 254 routine clinical samples. The results of the assays could be interpreted by the naked eye and compared with the gold standard gap-PCR. RESULTS: A total of 254 samples related to seven phenotypes and 27 different genotype groups showed 100% concordance between the colorimetric LAMP assays and gap-PCR for detecting (0)-thalassemia (3.5- and 45-kb deletions). The sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were calculated as 100% for both (0)-thalassemia 3.5- and 45-kb deletion detection. The comparison of the usefulness of colorimetric LAMP assays and conventional methods was demonstrated in this study.

There was an immediate need for easily accessible interventions for pregnant women experiencing elevated levels of pandemic related stress. METHODS: A three-session intervention Online Communities (OC) was developed at the beginning of the Dutch lockdown, and implemented by a team of midwives and psychologists specialized in Infant Mental Health. Pretest (N = 34) and posttest (N = 17) measurements of depressive symptoms, worries about COVID-19 and worries in general, and mother-to-infant bonding were administered, as well as a posttest evaluation. RESULTS: At pretest, the OC group was compared to two reference groups of pregnant women from an ongoing pregnancy cohort study: a COVID-19 (N = 209) and pre-COVID-19 reference group (N = 297). OC participants had significantly more depressive symptoms than both reference groups, and less positive feelings of bonding than the COVID-19 but not the pre-COVID-19 reference group. Compared to pretest, significant decreases in depressive symptoms (with significantly less participants scoring above cut-off) and worries about COVID-19 (large effect sizes) and worries in general (moderate to large effect size) were found at posttest for the OC participants. No significant improvement was found in bonding. Participants rated the intervention positively. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides initial evidence supporting the idea that OC is a promising and readily accessible intervention for pregnant women experiencing stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and possibly also applicable to other stressors.

Despite the growing proportion of the elderly population in Indonesia, data on the prevalence of malnutrition and adequacy of macronutrient and micronutrient intakes among Indonesian older adults are scattered and vary between studies. Therefore, our study aims to obtain data on malnutrition prevalence, level and distribution of nutrient intakes, and prevalence of macronutrient and micronutrient inadequacies in Indonesian community-dwelling older adults. Methods We carried out a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and registered in PROSPERO. A systematic electronic database search of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, ProQuest, HINARI, IMSEAR, GARUDA, and Indonesian Publication Index was undertaken. Additional searches were conducted in gray literature sources, hand-searching, retrospective searching, and personal communication with authors of the relevant publication. Observational studies presenting the malnutrition prevalence of habitual dietary intakes of older adults (60 years or older) were included. The risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal form. Sex-specific mean (and standard deviation) habitual macronutrient and a selection of micronutrients (calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12) intakes were extracted from each article to calculate the percentage of older people who were at risk for inadequate micronutrient intakes using a proxy of estimated average requirement (EAR) cut-point method, which is calculated from the national guideline of recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Prevalence of malnutrition, based on body mass index (BMI) categories and mini-nutritional assessment (MNA) criteria. and the population at risk of malnutrition were presented descriptively. Results Nine studies retrieved from electronic databases and gray literature were included in the pooled systematic analysis. According to BMI criteria, the underweight prevalence ranged from 8.0 to 26.6%. According to the MNA, the prevalence of malnutrition ranged from 2.1 to 14.6%, whereby the prevalence of at risk of malnutrition amounted to 18-78%. Our systematic review identified a high prevalence of nutrient inadequacies, most markedly for protein, calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Conclusion We signal a high risk of malnutrition along with poor macronutrients and micronutrients intakes among Indonesian community-dwelling older adults.

We retrospectively analyzed data of patients presenting multiple cerebral AVMs. RESULTS Six patients (mean age, 44 years, male-to-female ratio, 5) presented an angiographic diagnosis of cerebral mAVMs. Only one of them was known to have a HHT. Five patients presented two cerebral AVMs and one patient had three. Three AVMs (23.1 %) presented bleeding at admission.

This landscaping outlines the ways in which current mental models for MNH programs have fallen short for urban slum populations, and identifies implications for the global community. We employed a three-pronged approach, including a literature review, key informant interviews with global- and national-level experts, and a case study in Bangladesh. Main Body: Our findings highlight that the current mental model for MNH is inadequate to address the needs of the urban poor. Implementation challenges have arisen from using traditional methods that are not well adapted to traits typically inherent of slum settings. A re-thinking of implementation strategies will also need to consider a paucity of available routine data, lack of formal coordination between stakeholders and providers, and challenging municipal government structures. Innovative approaches, including with communications, outreach, and technology, will be necessary to move beyond traditional rural-centric approaches to MNH. As populations continue to urbanize, common slum dynamics will challenge conventional strategies for health service delivery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in a system that requires intersectoral collaborations to deliver quality care. Conclusion: To meet the MNH needs of the urban poor, programs will need to be iterative and adaptive, reflective of sociodemographic features. Integrating the social determinants of health into evaluations, using participatory human-centered design processes, and innovative public-private partnerships may prove beneficial in slum settings. But a willingness to rethink the roles of all actors within the delivery system overall may be needed most.","output":"Maternal and Newborn Health for the Urban Poor: The Need for a New Mental Model and Implementation Strategies to Accelerate Progress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As medication experts, clinical pharmacists play an active and dynamic role in a medication shortage response.

Vaccinations may precipitate relapses of NS, but there is no available data regarding inactivated influenza (flu) virus vaccines. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children with NS who had received flu vaccines between 2002 and 2015. The day of flu vaccination was defined as day 0, and the period between the pre-vaccination and the post-vaccination days was defined as ? X to + Y. The risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for NS relapse rate were estimated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) Poisson regression. RESULTS: A total of 104 pediatric patients received 208 flu vaccines. The mean age at onset of NS was at 4.85  3.87 years old. There were 261 NS relapses between days ? 180 and + 180.

We aim to examine the impact of facility-based isolation compared to self-isolation at home on the continuing epidemic in the United States. METHODS: We developed a compartment model to simulate the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 and calibrated it to key epidemic measures in the United States from March to September. We simulated facility-based isolation strategies with various capacities and starting times under different diagnosis rates. The primary model outcomes included the reduction of new infections and deaths over two months from October onwards. We further explored different effects of facility-based isolation under different epidemic burdens by major US Census Regions, and performed sensitivity analyses by varying key model assumptions and parameters. RESULTS: We projected that facility-based isolation with moderate capacity of 5 beds per 10 000 total population could avert 4.17 (95% Credible Interval 1.65-7.11) million new infections and 16 000 (8000-23 000) deaths in two months compared with home-based isolation, equivalent to relative reductions of 57% (44-61%) in new infections and 37% (27-40%) in deaths. Facility-based isolation with high capacity of 10 beds per 10 000 population would achieve greater reduction of 76% (62-84%) in new infections and 52% (37-64%) in deaths when supported by the expanded testing with a 20% daily diagnosis rate. Delays in implementation would substantially reduce the impact of facility-based isolation. The effective capacity and the impact of facility-based isolation varied by epidemic stage across regions. CONCLUSION: Timely facility-based isolation for mild COVID-19 cases could substantially reduce the number of new infections and effectively curb the continuing epidemic compared to home-based isolation. The local epidemic burden should determine the effective scale of facility-based isolation strategies.","output":"Positive impact of facility-based isolation of mild COVID-19 cases on effectively curbing the pandemic: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A roundup of the latest nursing news.","output":"News in brief."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neural Networks and related Deep Learning methods are currently at the leading edge of technologies used for classifying objects.

We tested the utility of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to classify and predict the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyse the serum peptidome from 72 COVID-19 patients (training cohort), clinically classified as mild (28), severe (23) and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. The resulting matrix of peak intensities was used for Machine Learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict COVID-19 severity of 22 independent patients (validation cohort). Finally, we analysed all sera by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) to identify the most relevant proteins associated to disease severity. RESULTS: We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Forty-two peaks exhibited a log fold change  1 and 17 were significantly different and at least four-fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. ML approach classified clinical stable patients according to their severity with a 100% of accuracy and predicted correctly the evolution of the non-stable patients in all cases. LC MS/MS identified five proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included the serum amyloid protein A2, which probably yielded the most intense peak detected by MALDI-TOF MS.

These common human coronaviruses share partial sequence homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); therefore, T cells specific to human coronaviruses are also cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Herein, we defined CD4(+) T cell responses that were cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 antigens in blood collected in 2016C2018 from healthy donors at the single allele level using artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) expressing a single HLA class II allotype. We assessed the allotype-restricted responses in the 42 individuals using the aAPCs matched 22 HLA-DR alleles, 19 HLA-DQ alleles, and 13 HLA-DP alleles. The response restricted by the HLA-DR locus showed the highest magnitude, and that by HLA-DP locus was higher than that by HLA-DQ locus. Since two alleles of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP loci are expressed co-dominantly in an individual, six different HLA class II allotypes can be used to the cross-reactive T cell response. Of the 16 individuals who showed a dominant T cell response, five, one, and ten showed a dominant response by a single allotype of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP, respectively. The single allotype-restricted T cells responded to only one antigen in the five individuals and all the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins in the six individuals. In individuals heterozygous for the HLA-DPA and HLA-DPB loci, four combinations of HLA-DP can be expressed, but only one combination showed a dominant response. These findings demonstrate that cross-reactive T cells to SARS-CoV-2 respond with single-allotype dominance.","output":"Comprehensive Analysis of CD4(+) T Cell Response Cross-Reactive to SARS-CoV-2 Antigens at the Single Allele Level of HLA Class II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 28th International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) was held in Rome, Italy from May 11 to 15, 2015.

A third keynote address, by Armand Sprecher, related the difficulties and successes of Mdicins Sans Frontires in West Africa ravaged by the Ebola outbreak. There were three mini-symposia on RNA Viruses, Antiviral Chemistry and Emerging Viruses. There was a good collection of talks on RNA viruses (norovirus, rabies, dengue, HEV, HCV, and RSV). A highlight of the chemistry was the preparation of prodrugs for nucleotide triphosphates as this opens a door to new options. The third mini-symposium emphasized how research work in the antiviral area is continuing to expand and needs to do so with a sense of urgency.

It is probably based on the ability to generate a latency that keeps viral activity at a very low level, thereby apparently minimising harm to its host. However, this evolutionary success disappears in immunosuppressed patients, especially in haematological patients. The relevance of infection and reactivation in haematological patients has been a matter of interest, although one fundamentally focused on reactivation in the post-allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patient cohort. Newer transplant modalities have been progressively introduced in clinical settings, with successively more drugs being used to manipulate graft composition and functionality. In addition, new antiviral drugs are available to treat CMV infection. We review the immunological architecture that is key to a favourable outcome in this subset of patients. Less is known about the effects of herpesvirus in terms of mortality or disease progression in patients with other malignant haematological diseases who are treated with immuno-chemotherapy or new molecules, or in patients who receive autologous SCT. The absence of serious consequences in these groups has probably limited the motivation to deepen our knowledge of this aspect. However, the introduction of new therapeutic agents for haematological malignancies has led to a better understanding of how natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes interact, and of the role of CMV infection in the context of recently introduced drugs such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, phosphoinosytol-3-kinase inhibitors, anti-BCL2 drugs, and even CAR-T cells.

These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact.

In this period, differentiation between COVID-19 and Influenza induced pneumonia will be critical for patient management. To develop an automated platform to perform this task, artificial intelligence models were developed by using the transfer learning techniques on chest CT. Methods: : Chest CT images from known cases of COVID-19, H1N1 Influenza induced pneumonia (before December 2019), and normal chest CTs were collected. Different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models, including VGG 16, VGG 19, ResNet-50, Wide ResNet, InceptionV3, and SqueezNet were fine-tuned on this data set. 60% of the dataset was used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for test the final models. Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score of each model were calculated. Results: : For differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia versus H1N1 Influenza pneumonia versus normal CTs, the ResNet-50 (accuracy above 92%) outperformed other models followed by InceptionV3 and wide ResNet. Conclusions: : The pre-trained image classification AI models are feasible to be fine-tuned and used for differentiation COVID-19 versus H1N1 Influenza pneumonia.

This pandemic has changed people's lifestyle and affected the regular delivery of standard cancer treatment. In the present study, we aimed to explore the influencing factors of delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, and the subjects were patients who were discharged from the department of burn and plastic surgery after February 2020. All participants completed this study's online questionnaire based on the WeChat and Wenjuanxing platforms. Levels of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Patients were divided into a delay group and non-delay group according to the occurrence of delayed treatment. Univariate analysis was performed by using the t test or chi-square test. A logistic regression model was employed to determine factors associated with delayed treatment. RESULTS: The present study included a total of 397 patients with breast cancer, among whom delayed treatment occurred in 76 patients, accounting for 19.1%. Scores on both the anxiety subscale and depression subscale in delay group were significantly higher than those in non-delay group. Compared with non-delay group, we found that patients in delay group usually had a higher level of education (P = 0.020), worse self-feeling (P = 0.030), poor compliance of medical order (P = 0.042), and a higher prevalence of anxiety (P = 0.004) and depression (P = 0.012). Traffic inconvenience was also an important relevant factor for delayed treatment (P = 0.001). The prevalence of recurrence in delay group was higher than that in non-delay group (P = 0.018). By using logistic multivariate regression analysis, the results revealed that level of education and traffic inconvenience were independent factors influencing delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Our findings reveal several influencing factors closely associated with delayed treatment, which is useful information that will be beneficial for patients to receive standardized therapy by taking targeted measures.","output":"Factors Influencing Delayed Treatment in Patients With Breast Cancer During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To develop a prognostic model to identify and quantify risk factors for mortality among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores, and calibration plots in the test set. Setting Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset. Participants 17,086 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 20, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Main outcome measure All-cause mortality during hospital stay. Results The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index = 0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were generally similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index = 0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index = 0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.2% for 18-year olds, 8.4% for 55-year olds, and 28.6% for 85-year olds. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 21.7% by March to 13.3% by May. Conclusion Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white blood cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.","output":"Risk factors for mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses (NPDs) in youth is increasing, and unhealthy physical activity (PA), diet, screen time, and sleep habits contribute to the chronic disease disparities and behavioral challenges this population experiences. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to adapt a proven exergaming and telehealth PA coaching intervention for typically developing youth with overweight or obesity; expand it to address diet, screen, and sleep behaviors; and then test its feasibility and acceptability, including PA engagement, among youth with NPDs. METHODS: Participants (N=23; mean age 15.1 years, SD 1.5; 17 males, 9 people of color) recruited in person from clinic and special education settings were randomized to the Adaptive GameSquad (AGS) intervention or wait-list control. The 10-week adapted intervention included 3 exergaming sessions per week and 6 real-time telehealth coaching sessions. The primary outcomes included feasibility (adherence to planned sessions), engagement (uptake and acceptability as reported on process questionnaires), and PA level (combined light, moderate, and vigorous as measured by accelerometer). Descriptive statistics summarized feasibility and engagement data, whereas paired, two-tailed t tests assessed group differences in pre-post PA. RESULTS: Of the 6 coaching sessions, AGS participants (n=11; mean age 15.3 years, SD 1.2; 7 males, 4 people of color) completed an average of 5 (83%), averaging 81.2 minutes per week of exergaming. Of 9 participants who completed the exit questionnaire, 6 (67%) reported intention to continue, and 8 (89%) reported feeling that the coaching sessions were helpful. PA and sleep appeared to increase during the course of the intervention over baseline, video game use appeared to decrease, and pre-post intervention PA per day significantly decreased for the control (?58.8 min; P=.04) but not for the intervention group (?5.3 min; P=.77), despite potential seasonality effects. However, beta testers and some intervention participants indicated a need for reduced complexity of technology and more choice in exergames. CONCLUSIONS: AGS shows promise in delivering a health behavior intervention remotely to youth with NPDs, but a full-scale efficacy trial with a larger sample size is needed to confirm this finding. On the basis of feedback from beta testers and intervention participants, the next steps should include reduced technology burden and increased exergame choice before efficacy testing.

Huizhou City utilized its experience with the SARS and MERS breakouts to establish a reperfusion treatment program for AIS patients. METHOD: This is a retrospective study on 8 certified stroke hospitals in Huizhou City from January 2020 to May 2020. We analyzed the number of AIS patients with reperfusion therapy, stroke type (anterior/posterior circulation stroke), modes of transport to hospital, NIHSS score, onset to door time (ODT), door to needle time (DNT), and door to puncture time (DPT). The analysis was compared with baseline data from the same time period in 2019. RESULT: In 2020, the number of AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy decreased (315 vs. 377), NIHSS score increased [8 (4, 15) vs. 7 [ (1, 2)], P = 0.024], ODT increased [126 (67.5, 210.0) vs. 120.0 (64.0, 179.0), P = 0.032], and DNT decreased [40 (32.5, 55) vs. 48 (36, 59), P = 0.003].

Several previous studies have reported elevations of inflammatory markers in Covid-19 positive patients and suggested a possible correlation to disease severity. Methods We identified 69 patients from Baton Rouge General (BRG) Hospital who were admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and laboratory confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 13 and April 5, 2020. Demographic and laboratory data were obtained through a review of medical records. Statistical analysis was performed on several inflammatory markers in association with clinical disease severity. Results We identified 69 patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 6514 years, 68% were male and 32% were female. A total of 13 patients (19%) were considered to have mild disease, 25 (36%) had moderate disease, and 31 (45%) were considered to have severe disease. A total of nine patients died (13%), 25 (36%) have been discharged from the hospital, 20 (29%) remain in the ICU, and 15 (22%) remain admitted to the hospital at the time of writing. Lymphopenia was common among hospitalized patients (39%) and was found to be statistically more pronounced in patients with severe disease (p<0.05). Inflammatory marker elevations were also seen in several patients, with statistically significant elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p <0.05).

It is hypothesized that modulating scaffold degradation would change EC phenotype. Scaffolds with differential degradation are prepared by cross-linking and predegradation. Vascular injury increases degradation and the presence of MEECs retards injury-mediated degradation. MEECs respond to differential scaffold properties with altered viability in vivo, suppressed smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vitro, and altered interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. When implanted perivascularly to a murine carotid wire injury, tuned scaffolds change MEEC effects on vascular repair and inflammation. Live animal imaging enables real-time tracking of cell viability, inflammation, and scaffold degradation, affording an unprecedented understanding of interactions between cells, substrate, and tissue.

Vitamin D is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level with COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asia, predicting with other confounding factors such as median age, obesity, and diabetes. METHODS: COVID-19 infections and mortalities among the Asian countries were retrieved from the Worldometer website. Information on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D values in each Asian country was retrieved through literature searching on PubMed? and Google scholar. The associations between COVID-19 infections and mortalities with prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and mean vitamin D level were explored with correlation coefficients. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression was carried out with all confounders. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 infections (r = 0.55; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.31) and mortalities (r = 0.50; p = 0.01; R2 = 0.25). Moreover, the associations for the COVID-19 infections and mortalities improved to r = 0.76 (p = 0.002; R2 = 0.58) and r = 0.65 (p = 0.03; R2 = 0.42), respectively, after predicting with confounding factors. Similarly, mean vitamin D level had a significant negative correlation with COVID-19 infections (r = -0.77; p = 0.04; R2 = 0.59) and mortalities (r = -0.80; p = 0.03; R2 = 0.63) when combining with confounders. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significantly positively associated whereas the mean vitamin D level is significantly negatively associated with both infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 among Asian countries upon predicting with all confounders.","output":"Impact of the vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 infection and mortality in Asian countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Evaluating the TBI incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic era compared with similar period in previous year. BACKGROUND The emergence of SARS-CoV2 influenced the evolution of governmental and hospital policy worldwide, which might eventually impact many aspects. The incidence of many diseases in the Emergency Department (ED), especially traumatic brain injury (TBI), has been an area of interest. DESIGN/METHODS Retrospective study comparing TBI incidence before and during COVID-19 pandemic era starting from the declaration of national pandemic date (March 16, 2020) until June 14, 2020 with the comparison of the same period in the previous year. RESULTS There was an increase in admission rate due to TBI during COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous year (157/752 (20.9%) vs 106/766 (13.8%), p < 0.001, respectively). While the range of age was similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 era (37.9  14.8 vs 38.6  15.4 years, p = 0.712), male was higher in percentage to experience the injury (131/157 (83.4%) vs 67/106 (63.2%), p < 0.001). During the pandemic era, road traffic injury (97/157 (61.8%) vs 56/106 (52.8%), p = 0.149) as well as moderate-to-severe brain injury tended to increase (30/157 (19.1%) vs 17/106 (16.0%) p = 0.524) albeit statistically insignificant. Although the mortality rate was similar (12/157 (7.6%) vs 9/106 (8.5%), p = 0.804), higher hospitalization rate was observed in the pandemic era (81/157 (51.2%) vs 37/106 (34.9%) p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS TBI incidence remained increasing despite entering the COVID-19 era. These phenomena required further investigation and analysis that may possibly be unrelated with the COVID-19, but due to the change of the government policy and its impact, such as the more quiet road after national social distancing.","output":"Increasing Traumatic Brain Injury Incidence during COVID-19 Pandemic in the Emergency Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital-A National Referral Hospital in Indonesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This research employs a transformative service lens to examine the role of the supply chain ecosystem in ensuring the health and safety of employees and customers as a well-being outcome during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

This study aimed to explore the value of the triage heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and temperature, either alone or when combined with individual symptoms and signs, in predicting influenza infection in this age group. This was a retrospective study covering 4 influenza seasons from 2017 to 2019 in an emergency department (ED) in Hong Kong. We recruited patients 5 years of age who had an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction influenza test within 48 hours of ED presentation. The diagnostic performance of the triage HR, RR, and temperature was evaluated as dichotomized or categorized values with diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) calculated based on different age-appropriate thresholds. Linear discriminant analysis was performed to assess the combined discriminatory effect of age, HR, RR, and temperature as continuous variables. Of 322 patients (median age 26 months), 99 had influenza A and 13 had influenza B infection. For HR and RR dichotomized based on age-appropriate thresholds, the DORs ranged from 1.16 to 1.54 and 0.78 to 1.53, respectively. A triage temperature 39.0 C had the highest DOR (3.32) among different degrees of elevation of temperature. The diagnostic criteria that were based on the presence of fever and cough and/or rhinitis symptoms had a higher DOR compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness criteria (4.42 vs 2.41). However, combining HR, RR, or temperature with such diagnostic criteria added very little to the diagnostic performance. The linear discriminant analysis model had a high specificity of 92.5%, but the sensitivity (18.3%) was too low for clinical use. Triage HR, RR, and temperature had limited value in the diagnosis of influenza in children 5 years of age in the ED. Fever and cough and/or rhinitis symptoms had a better diagnostic performance than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza-like illness criteria in predicting influenza in this age group.","output":"The limited value of triage vital signs in predicting influenza infection in children aged 5 years and under in the emergency department : A single-center retrospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Tocilizumab (TCZ) through intravenous infusion has been shown to effectively treat active thyroid eye disease (TED) refractory to systemic steroids.

Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies.

Public understanding, including knowledge about signs and symptoms, mode of transmission, and hygiene of COVID-19, is vital for designing effective control strategies during a public health crisis. The current study is aimed at investigating the publics perspective about COVID-19, including their knowledge, attitude, and practices. Methods: A rapid online survey comprising 22 items was administered during the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Questions were focused on the prevention, transmission, clinical features, and control of COVID-19. In addition, the attitudes and practices of the participants were explored. Descriptive statistics, MannCWhitney tests, KruskalCWallis tests, and regression analysis were carried out during data analysis. Results: A total of 1257 respondents participated in this study. Most of the respondents had good knowledge (good = 64.8%, average = 30.5%, poor = 4.7%) of COVID-19. Gender, marital status, education, and residence were observed to have a significant association with the knowledge score. A vast majority of the survey respondents (77.0%) believed that COVID-19 would be controlled successfully in Pakistan. The practices of wearing a mask (85.8%) and handwashing (88.1%) were common among the participants.

A comprehensive, multi-level strategy against COVID-19 should include drug targeting of biomolecules and biochemical pathways involved in the prevention and proliferation of the infection, and the fatal or serious symptoms following infection. Several drugs are routinely used in the treatment of different categories of seriously ill COVID-19 patients including tocilizumab, remdesivir and dexamethasone. The current risk/benefit assessment supports the emergency testing and approval of more drugs. The process for new drug selection could be based on the identification of one drug for one target, or of a multi-potent drug for many targets and drug combinations for one or more targets, that can cause a substantial reduction in the high mortality rate of COVID-19. Several drugs have been identified that can fit this potential role by targeting different stages of COVID-19 including baricitinib, molnupiravir and PF-07321332/ritonavir and also the combination of deferiprone with N-acetylcysteine for inhibiting the vicious circle of oxidative stress toxicity and endothelial cell damage.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes: perinatal mortality rate, stillbirth rate, early neonatal mortality rate SECONDARY OUTCOMES: case fatality rates (CFR) for asphyxia, complications of prematurity and neonatal sepsis RESULTS: 526 PNDs were audited: 142 (27 0%) fresh stillbirths, 125 (23 8%) macerated stillbirths and 259 (49 2%) early neonatal deaths The ITS analysis showed a decrease in perinatal death (PND) rates without the introduction of PND audits (incidence risk ratio (IRR) (95% CI) for time=0 94, p&lt;0 001), but an increase in PND (IRR (95% CI)=1 17 (1 0

occurrence of more than 2 diseases, is no longer an exception Especially non communicable chronic diseases like Osteoarthritis (OA), Diabetes mellitus Type 2 (DMT2), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) as well as cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) are examples of the most prevalent chronic conditions in industrial nations The treatment of multimorbidity has not gained much attention in research so far Especially conservative therapies other than medication have not been established for this specific population Physical exercise (PE) has been shown to be a treatment option with little adverse events and many positive effects for many single diseases, and physical activity (PA) promotion in general has found its way in many disease management programs However, a shortfall of research on the effectiveness of specific PE interventions in the treatment of multimorbidity must be stated The objective of this study therefore was to evaluate a pilot model aiming for behavior change towards the initiation and maintenance of regular PE and its related health benefits in patients with multimorbidity This abstract focuses on a subsample of participants with knee osteoarthritis Strength measures of the knee flexors and extensors and self-reported disease related symptoms were analyzed Methods: Participants with at least two severe risk factors or manifested disease signs for hip and/or knee OA, DMT2, OW/OB, CVD were included in the study The following analysis relates to the subsample of subjects with or at risk for knee OA The intervention consisted of two 12-week successive phases The first phase included different types of supervised aerobic and strength training sessions Dosage parameters were based on the national PA recommendations The intervention further comprised theoretical background information on training science, nutrition and behavioral change techniques as well as two personal counselling sessions with the aim to enable participants towards an autonomous exercise participation The second intervention phase enhanced the self-organized maintenance of the same level of PE In this phase, participants were contacted via email on a regular base They received weekly training logs and feedback on their logs as well as another personal counselling session Data were assessed at baseline (t0), after the first (t3) and after the second intervention phase (t6) Outcomes of this analysis relate to self-reported disease-related symptoms (WOMAC subscale pain and physical functioning) and isometric peak torque measures for knee flexion and extension The study was conducted in two recruitment waves for organizational reasons Due to the Covid-19 induced nationwide contact restrictions, strength measures could not be assessed for wave two at t3 in March 2020, therefore only t6 was used for further analysis of strength measures Wilcoxon Tests were calculated for non-parametric data to assess the changes between t0-t3 and t0-t6 Effect sizes were calculated using r The study is registered at the German clinical trial register (DRKS00016702) Results: N=39 patients were included in the study, thereof n=23 participants (females=19, males=4) showed disease signs or self-reported risk factors for knee OA The mean BMI of them was 30 3  3 2 kg/m2 and the mean age was 58 3  6 3 years Of the subsample, n=22 were also overweight or obese, n=16 had a diagnosis of hypertension, n=2 were diagnosed with DMT2 and n=16 had an elevated risk for DMT2 The WOMAC score was not answered by three participants at t3 One participant did not perform the knee extension test due to pain at t0 and t6 One participant did not perform the isometric torque at t6 due to an elevated blood pressure 2 participants were lost to follow-up due to family illness (n=1) and shortage of time caused by Covid-19 induced overtime (n=1) and did not provide any data at t6 Median values for WOMAC pain decreased from t0 to t3 but not from t0 to t6, this was not statistically significant The decrease for the subscale physical function from t0 to t3 and t6 was not statistically significant as well (Table 1) [Formula presented] There was a statistically significant change for isometric peak torque of knee extension Strength values for knee flexion increased as well, however this was not statistically significant (Table 2, Figure 1) [Formula presented] [Formula

the study showed an increase in maximal isometric force of knee extension with a large effect size This is an important finding for patients with risk factors as well as already manifested knee OA, as quadriceps strength is known as a protective factor for knee OA and its progression Results for the WOMAC showed marginal improvement throughout the intervention period The majority of people only had minor complaints at the beginning of the study, reducing the potential for positive change One limitation of the study is the onset of the Covid-19 related contact restrictions that prohibited strength measures as well as physical exercise training sessions in gyms and other public places for participants of wave 2 from the 9th intervention week on The influence of this force majeure on the results of the study cannot be conclusively assessed at this point Further limitations are related to the small sample size, especially for the subgroup of patients with OA, and the lack of a control

on the definition of neighborhood. The present study uses a publicly available dataset to examine whether associations between neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) and fruit/vegetable (FV) consumption vary when NSES is defined by different neighborhood sizes and shapes. Methods: We analyzed data from 1,736 adults with data in GeoFLASHE, a geospatial extension of the National Cancer Institute's Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating Study (FLASHE). We examined correlations of NSES values across neighborhood buffer shapes (circular or street network) and sizes (ranging from 400 to 1,200 m) and ran weighted simple and multivariable regressions modeling frequency of FV consumption by NSES for each neighborhood definition. Regressions were also stratified by gender. Results: NSES measures were highly correlated across various neighborhood buffer definitions. In models adjusted for socio-demographics, circular buffers of all sizes and street buffers 750 m and larger were significantly associated with FV consumption frequency for women only. Conclusion: NSES may be particularly relevant for women's FV consumption, and further research can examine whether these associations are explained by access to food stores, food shopping behavior, and/or psychosocial variables.

To this end, we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to inactivated and live TBEV and assessed cellular responses by RNA sequencing. Both inactivated and live TBEV significantly induced an interferon-dominated gene signature and an increased RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) expression. Using pathway-specific inhibitors, we assessed the involvement of pattern recognition receptors in the sensing of inactivated or live TBEV. Only RLR pathway inhibition significantly suppressed the downstream cascade induced by I-TBEV, while responses to the replicating virus were impacted by the inhibition of RIG-I-like, as well as Toll-like, receptors.

Phenotypic assessment indicated that, in COVID-19 convalescent participants, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses displayed an early differentiated memory phenotype with limited capacity to produce IFN. Conversely, in participants with no reported symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses were enriched in late differentiated cells, co-expressing IFN and TNF&#945; and also Granzyme B.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HFNC therapy in patients with COPD and type II respiratory failure, to provide evidence to the clinical COPD management. METHODS: We searched Cochrane et al. databases up to Dec 31, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of HFNC therapy in patients with COPD and type II respiratory failure. Two researchers independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and evaluated the quality of the literature and extracted data. We used Revman5.3 software for statistical analysis of collected data. RESULTS: A total of 6 RCTs involving 525 COPD and type II respiratory failure patients. Meta-analyses indicated that compared with NIV, HFNC could significantly reduce PaCO(2) level (MD = ? 2.64, 95% CI (? 3.12 to ? 2.15)), length of hospital stay ((MD = C 1.19, 95 CI (? 2.23 to ? 0.05)), the incidence of nasal facial skin breakdown ((OR = 0.11, 95% CI (0.03C0.41)).

The main objectives of this study were to i) investigate the temporal variations of ambient PM2.5 in Marseille (Southern France), where air pollution is again a major public health issue, and ii) estimate their short-term health effects and annual trend (Mann-Kendall test) over a 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. In Marseille, the main sources of PM2.5 could be related to road traffic, industrial complexes, and oil refineries surrounded the city. The number of premature deaths and hospital admissions attributable to ambient PM2.5 exposure for non-accidental causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were estimated by using in-situ air quality data, city-specific relative risk values and baseline incidence. Despite significant reduction of PM2.5 (- 0.80 g m-3 year-1), Marseille citizens were exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guideline for human health protection (10 g m-3) during entire study period. Exposure to ambient PM2.5 substantially contributed to mortality and hospital admissions: 871 deaths for non-accidental causes, 515 deaths for cardiovascular diseases, 47 deaths for respiratory diseases, as well as 1034 hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases and 834 for respiratory diseases were reported between 2010 and 2019. Compliance with WHO annual limit values can result in substantial socio-economic benefits by preventing premature deaths and hospital admissions. For instance, based on the value of a statistical life and average cost of a hospital admission, the associated benefit for healthcare would have been 131 million in 2019. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of PM2.5-related non-accidental deaths decreased by 1.15 per 105 inhabitants annually.

METHODS A deterministic mathematical model was designed to evaluate the dynamic interactions between mobility, sexual behaviour, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections. The model was based on a population study of 488 adults, which included male migrants, male non-migrants and their rural partners in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. RESULTS The model predicted that the impact of migration depends upon the epidemic's stage and the pattern of migration. Early in the epidemic, frequent migration between populations with different HIV prevalence rates accelerated HIV spread; however, local sexual risk behaviour determined the eventual scale of the epidemic. If migration is coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour by migrant men, as has been reported in the South African communities studied, HIV prevalence would increase 10 times among migrants' female partners (1.8 to 19%). In contrast, if migration were to occur infrequently, with migration-associated risk behaviour assumed to be at current levels, the predicted epidemic would be one fifth that currently observed (2.8 versus 15.1%). CONCLUSIONS Migration primarily influences HIV spread by increasing high-risk sexual behaviour, rather than by connecting areas of low and high risk. Frequent return of migrants is an important risk factor when coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour. Accordingly, intervention programmes in South Africa need to target the sexual behaviour of short-term migrants specifically, even though these individuals may be more difficult to identify.","output":"Modelling the impact of migration on the HIV epidemic in South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need to move classrooms online caused by the disruption of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in March 2020 could have long\\\\term, potentially positive consequences for the future of online learning and adult students.

To address these uncertainties, we evaluated the persistence of Ebola virus spiked in sterilized domestic sewage. The viral titer decreased approximately 99% within the first test day from an initial viral titer of 10(6) TCID(50) mL(C1); however, it could not be determined if this initial rapid decrease was due to aggregation or inactivation of the viral particles. The subsequent viral titer decrease was less rapid, and infectious Ebola virus particles persisted for all 8 days of the test. The inactivation constant (k) was determined to be ?1.08 (2.1 days for a 90% viral titer decrease). Due to experimental conditions, we believe these results to be an upper bound for Ebola virus persistence in wastewater. Wastewater composition is inherently heterogeneous; subsequently, we caution that interpretation of these results should be made within a holistic assessment, including the effects of wastewater composition, dilution, and potential exposure routes within wastewater infrastructure. While it remains unknown if Ebola virus may be transmitted via wastewater, these data demonstrate a potential exposure route to infectious Ebola virus via wastewater and emphasize the value of a precautionary approach to wastewater handling in an epidemic response.","output":"Persistence of Ebola Virus in Sterilized Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has had a positive impact on the outcomes after lung transplantation.

METHODS Anaesthetised juvenile pigs were assigned between two groups: normocarbia (control group, n = 10) or hypercarbia [high carbon dioxide (CO2) group, n = 8]. Normocarbia subjects were maintained with an arterial CO2 of 40 Torr, while the hypercarbia subjects had an increase of inspired CO2 to achieve an arterial pCO2 of >80 Torr. Gradual hypotension was induced by continuous haemorrhage from a catheter in the femoral vein, and the LLA was determined by monitoring cortical laser Doppler flux (LDF). Vascular reactivity monitoring was performed using the pressure reactivity index (PRx) and haemoglobin volume index (HVx). RESULTS There were no sustained differences in ICP between groups. Autoregulation was present in both groups, despite elevation in pCO2.The control group had an average LLA of 45 mmHg (95% CI: 43-47 mmHg) and the high CO2 group had a LLA of 75 mmHg (95% CI: 73-77 mmHg). The detected LLA for each subject correlated with the level of pCO2 (spearman R = 0.8243, P < 0.0001). Both the PRx and HVx accurately detected the LLA despite the presence of hypercarbia. DISCUSSION Hypercarbia without acidosis increases the observed LLA independent of alterations in ICP.

It is also unknown if e-consult utilization during the pandemic replaced or merely deferred the need for a specialty appointment. We evaluated if primary care providers' (PCPs) e-consult utilization and specialists' recommendations for specialty appointments changed after the transition to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cohort study used an interrupted time series analysis of e-consult utilization in a large, urban academic health care system between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020; the post-telemedicine time period began March 15, 2020. The primary outcome measure was the odds of an e-consult ordered during a PCP appointment; the secondary outcome measure was the odds of a specialist recommending a specialty appointment in an e-consult. Results: During 193,263 PCP appointments, 1,318 e-consults were placed to internal medicine subspecialties. Compared to the pre-telemedicine time period, the odds of a PCP ordering an e-consult increased (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02-1.07]) and the odds of specialists recommending specialty appointments increased (OR 1.11, 95% CI [1.06-1.15]). Conclusions: E-consult use increased following the transition to telemedicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PCPs consider the e-consult a valuable tool for patient care when there is limited availability of specialty appointments.

This was realized by the use of a pager system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the timeframe of 12.5 weeks (04.06.2020-31.08.2020), ENT outpatients were issued with pagers. The patients could thus move freely within the hospital and grounds. The pager system was activated 10-15a?min before the appointment, to call patients back to the outpatient ENT clinic. questionnaires were used to evaluate the system and examine patients' acceptance and satisfaction. RESULTS: The 137 questionnaires analyzed showed satisfaction with the system, not only regarding distancing rules but also with the more comfortable waiting time.

In response to this challenge, in 2007, the African Centre for Integrated Laboratory Training (ACILT) was established in South Africa with a mission to train staffs from countries with high burdens of diseases in skills needed to strengthen sustainable laboratory systems. This study was undertaken to assess the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to other laboratory staff, and to identify enabling and obstructive factors to their implementation. METHODS: We used Kirkpatrick model to determine training effectiveness by assessing the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to participant's work environment, along with measuring enabling and obstructive factors. In addition to regular course evaluations at ACILT (pre and post training), in 2015 we sent e-questionnaires to 867 participants in 43 countries for course participation between 2008 and 2014. Diagnostics courses included Viral Load, and systems strengthening included strategic planning and Biosafety and Biosecurity. SAS v9.44 and Excel were used to analyze retrospective de-identified data collected at six months pre and post-training. RESULTS: Of the 867 participants, 203 (23.4%) responded and reported average improvements in accuracy and timeliness in Viral Load programs and to systems strengthening. For Viral Load testing, frequency of corrective action for unsatisfactory proficiency scores improved from 57 to 91%, testing error rates reduced from 12.9% to 4.9%; 88% responders contributed to the first national strategic plan development and 91% developed strategies to mitigate biosafety risks in their institutions. Key enabling factors were team and management support, and key obstructive factors included insufficient resources and staff's resistance to change. CONCLUSIONS: Training at ACILT had a documented positive impact on strengthening the laboratory capacity and laboratory workforce and substantial cost savings. ACILT's investment produced a multiplier effect whereby national laboratory systems, personnel and leadership reaped training benefits.

DESIGN: Nationwide, cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey. SETTING: 56 randomly selected communities in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone. PARTICIPANTS: 1253 adults aged 18 years and older of which 52% were men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated proportions of core indicators (awareness, knowledge, risk perception, practices). A composite variable for knowledge (based on seven variables) was created, and categorised into low (0-2 correct), medium (3-4) and high (5-7). Predictors of knowledge were analysed with multilevel ordinal regression models. Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: We found that 75% of the respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A majority (70%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared with 61% of men. 60% of men and 54% of women had already taken action to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap and water (87%). Radio (73%) was the most used source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (39%). Having a medium or high level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.3).

Transumbilical lung resection was performed via an umbilical incision and a diaphragmatic incision. In the conventional thoracoscopic group, lung resection was completed through a thoracic incision. For both procedures, we compared the surgical outcomes, for example, operating time and operative complications; physiologic parameters, for example, respiratory rate and body temperature; inflammatory parameters, for example, white blood cell count; and pulmonary parameters, for example, arterial blood gas levels. The animals were euthanized 2 weeks after the surgery for gross and histologic evaluations. RESULTS The lung wedge resection was successfully performed in all animals. There was no significant difference in the mean operating times or complications between the transumbilical and the conventional thoracoscopic approach groups. With regard to the physiologic impact of the surgeries, the transumbilical approach was associated with significant elevations in body temperature on postoperative day 1, when compared with the standard thoracoscopic approach.

Decisions regarding interventions and eligibility for immune modulatory therapy are often made at the time of admission to the ICU. The primary aim of this study was to compare the host immune response measured upon ICU admission in CAP patients admitted immediately from the emergency department (direct ICU admission) with those who were transferred within 72 h after admission to the general ward (delayed ICU admission). METHODS: Sixteen host response biomarkers providing insight in pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in sepsis and blood leukocyte transcriptomes were analysed in patients with CAP upon ICU admission in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Of 530 ICU admissions with CAP, 387 (73.0%) were directly admitted and 143 (27.0%) had a delayed admission. Patients with a delayed ICU admission were more often immunocompromised (35.0 versus 21.2%, P = .002) and had more malignancies (23.1 versus 13.4%, P = .011). Shock was more present in patients who were admitted to the ICU directly (46.6 versus 33.6%, P = .010). Delayed ICU admission was not associated with an increased hospital mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.89C1.78, P = .20). The plasma levels of biomarkers (n = 297) reflecting systemic inflammation, endothelial cell activation and coagulation activation were largely similar between groups, with exception of C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and angiopoietin-1, which were more aberrant in delayed admissions compared to direct ICU admissions. Blood leukocyte transcriptomes (n = 132) of patients with a delayed ICU admission showed blunted innate and adaptive immune response signalling when compared with direct ICU admissions, as well as decreased gene expression associated with tissue repair and extracellular matrix remodelling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Blood leukocytes of CAP patients with delayed ICU admission show evidence of a more immune suppressive phenotype upon ICU admission when compared with blood leukocytes from patients directly transferred to the ICU.

We propose a rigorous hybrid model-and-data-driven approach to risk scoring based on a time-varying SIR epidemic model that ultimately yields a simplified color-coded risk level for each community. The risk score $_t$ that we propose is proportional to the probability of someone currently healthy getting infected in the next 24 hours. We show how this risk score can be estimated using another useful metric of infection spread, $R_t$, the time-varying average reproduction number which indicates the average number of individuals an infected person would infect in turn. The proposed approach also allows for quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of $R_t$ and $_t$ in the form of confidence intervals.

The patient had a driving license and never experienced any visual problems before. At presentation, his visual acuity was 160/200 in both eyes with the main complaint of visual field deterioration. Other neurologic exams and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reported normal by a neurologist. Optic disc cupping was near total in both eyes with a very narrow remaining rim. Optic disc cupping was very similar to glaucomatous cupping. Intraocular pressure was checked several times via Goldmann tonometry and was 13 mmHg. There was no history of refractive surgery leading to thin cornea. Based on this case, methanol poisoning can mimic glaucomatous optic disc cupping.

As thousands of patients are hospitalized, the disease has shown remarkable diversity in its manifestation; many patients with mild to no symptoms recover from the disease requiring minimal care, but some patients with severe disease progression require mechanical ventilation support in intensive care units (ICU) with an increased risk of death. Studying the characteristics of patients in these various strata can help us understand the varied progression of this disease, enable earlier interventions for at-risk patients, and help manage medical resources more efficiently. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of 10,123 COVID-19 patients treated at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, including their demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical history. Specifically, we present a staging scheme based on discrete clinical events (i.e., admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death), and investigate the temporal trend of clinical variables and the effect of comorbidities in each of those stages. We then developed a prognostic model to predict ventilation demands at an individual patient level by analyzing baseline clinical variables, which entails (1) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and a decision tree model to identify predictors for mechanical ventilation; and (2) a logistic regression model based on these risk factors to predict which patients will eventually need ventilatory support. Our results indicate that the prognostic model achieves an AUC of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.765-0.880) in identifying patients who will eventually require mechanical ventilation.","output":"A Retrospective Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 as Seen by a Large Urban Hospital in Chicago"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic COVID-19 has severely affected the global economy The strict lockdown measures have also changed the daily live, including consumer behavior in retail banking In this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on consumer behavior in retail banking, with a special focus on the Romanian banking sector To achieve our goal, we performed a survey among the Romanian consumers in retail banking, using as research method the field survey based on questionnaire The final sample comprised 738 valid responses from the metropolitan area retail banking consumers The research brings a fresh insight on retail banking services consumption during the pandemic and validates a conceptual model regarding the internet and mobile banking services acceptance The research' results highlighted, among others, that the variable concerning the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on consumers' lifestyle has a direct and positive influence on the variable regarding the attitude toward internet and mobile banking services, mediated by other variables like safety of internet and mobile banking use and trust in banks Several social and managerial implications are also discussed, because it is possible that the tendency to use internet and mobile banking services will prevail even after the post pandemic stage, as new consumption behavior models are developing Banks in Romania should increase their initiatives to offer financial education courses and online tutorials to familiarize customers with the use of digital channels Banks should also improve communication with clients and design new products and services to increase the attractiveness of saving process They should demonstrate flexibility in negotiating lending and refinancing conditions as well","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior in retail banking.

Following contig assembly into genome-length cDNA, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses (rMERS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type MERS-CoV contains a tissue culture-adapted T1015N mutation in the S glycoprotein, rMERS-CoV replicated ~0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein ORF5 (rMERS?ORF5) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-RFP) or deleted the entire ORF3, 4, and 5 accessory cluster (rMERS-ORF3-5). Recombinant rMERS-CoV, rMERS-CoV?ORF5, and MERS-CoV-RFP replicated to high titers, whereas MERS-ORF3-5 showed 1-1.5 logs reduced titer compared with rMERS-CoV.

Data Sources C Data were examined from the human and veterinary literature identified through Pubmed and references listed in appropriate articles pertaining to apoptosis. Human Data Synthesis C The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis C Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions C Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically.

In this study, we study the telemedicine assignment between the patients and telemedical specialists by considering different sources of uncertainty, i.e. uncertain service duration and the no-show behavior of the doctors that is caused by the unexpected situations (i.e. emergency events). We propose a two-stage chance-constrained model with the assignment decisions in the recourse problem and employ an uncertainty set to capture the behavior of telemedical doctors, which finally gives rise to a two-stage binary integer program with binary variables in the recourse problem. We propose an enumeration-based column-and-constraint generation solution method to solve the resulting problem. A simple numerical study is done to illustrate our proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate the behavior of doctors and uncertain service duration for the telemedicine assignment problem in the literature.

Multilevel linear regression, linear regression, and regression-tree analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We found that most participants tended to trust the healthcare system, although a substantial part could still be classified as distrusting (approx. 21%). Multiple variables, including being middle-aged or of older age, being female, lower levels of education, unemployment, worse general health status, having income difficulties, having unmet needs for healthcare, no healthcare contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, higher mental distress, and loneliness, were significantly associated with lower levels of trust. Among these variables mental distress, income difficulties, and unmet needs for healthcare emerged as especially important and, across European regions and countries, consistent predictors for lower trust in the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Acute myocardial infarction was found as concurrent cause of death in 3 (21.4%) patients, and significant cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight 750 g) was present in 1 (7.1%) patient with ATTR-positive cardiac amyloidosis. The autopsy findings confirm that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, with major involvement of the lungs, that increases the risk of cardiac and vascular complications including acute myocardial injury and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. Secondary acute bronchopneumonia is a common complication in patients with COVID-19 and may be the major cause of death.","output":"Analysis of cardiopulmonary findings in COVID-19 fatalities: High incidence of pulmonary artery thrombi and acute suppurative bronchopneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a sequence of variables having multinomial distribution with the number of trials corresponding to these variables being large and possibly different. The multinomial probabilities of the categories are assumed to vary randomly depending on batches. The proposed framework is interesting from the perspective of various applications in practice such as predicting the winner of an election, forecasting the market share of different brands etc. In this work, first we derive sufficient conditions of asymptotic normality of the estimates of the multinomial cell probabilities, and corresponding suitable transformations. Then, we consider a Bayesian setting to implement our model. We consider hierarchical priors using multivariate normal and inverse Wishart distributions, and establish the posterior consistency. Based on this result and following appropriate Gibbs sampling algorithms, we can infer about aggregate data.

Viral agents include emerging and re-emerging pathogens characterized by extremely small size, and high environmental stability. Since the mainly used conventional disinfection methods are usually not able to achieve complete disinfection of viral and other microbial targets, in real water and wastewater matrices, effective strategies for the treatment, use and reuse of water and the development of next-generation water supply systems are required. The scope of the present systematic review was to summarize research data on the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for viral disinfection of water and wastewater. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. This comprehensive research yielded 23 records which met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. Most of the studies (14/23) used only MS2 bacteriophage as an index virus, while the remaining studies (9/23) used two or more viral targets, including phages (MS2, T4, T7, phiX174, PRD-1, S2, ?B124-14, ?crAssphage) and/or Adenovirus, Aichivirus, Norovirus (I, II, IV), Polyomavirus (JC and BK), Sapovirus, Enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B3, Echovirus, and Pepper mild mottle virus.

However, little is known about the potential ecological risks of this virus despite its presence in freshwater systems. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the exposure of Poecilia reticulata juveniles to two peptides derived from Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which was synthesized in the laboratory (named PSPD-2002 and PSPD-2003). For this, the animals were exposed for 35 days to the peptides at a concentration of 40 g/L and different toxicity biomarkers were assessed. Our data indicated that the peptides were able to induce anxiety-like behavior in the open field test and increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The biometric evaluation also revealed that the animals exposed to the peptides displayed alterations in the pattern of growth/development. Furthermore, the increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes were accompanied by increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which suggests a redox imbalance induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides. Moreover, molecular docking analysis suggested a strong interaction of the peptides with the enzymes AChE, SOD and CAT, allowing us to infer that the observed effects are related to the direct action of the peptides on the functionality of these enzymes.

In fact, social anxiety more than quadruples the risk of developing cannabis use disorder, yet it is inconsistently related to more cannabis use. Inconsistent findings may be due to lack of attention to protective behavioral strategies (PBS) among socially anxious cannabis users. PBS are cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce cannabis use and related problems. Yet socially anxious persons may be less likely to use PBS for a variety of reasons (e.g., fear of negative evaluation for engaging in behaviors to reduce use), leading to heavier or more frequent use and related problems. The current study examined the mediating role of PBS in the relationships of social anxiety with past-month cannabis use and related problems among current (past-month) cannabis users (Na?=a?102). Social anxiety was significantly positively related to past-month cannabis problems, but not directly related to cannabis use. Social anxiety was significantly negatively related to PBS. Social anxiety was indirectly (via PBS) related to more frequent use, greater peak use, and more cannabis problems. Serial mediation analyses indicated that social anxiety was indirectly related to more cannabis problems via the serial effects of PBS and cannabis use variables. Findings suggest that socially anxious persons may be vulnerable to heavier cannabis use and more cannabis problems due to PBS underutilization.

We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS: Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenario 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS: Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","output":"Diagnostic Serial Interval as an Indicator for Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in the COVID-19 Pandemic - A Simulation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of considerations on the potential attenuation of the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic with the use of credible social media in online education during a pandemic, the subject of our own research was the fulfillment of two goals. The main research goals were to identify, categorize, and evaluate the possibilities of using social media in online education during the pandemic from the perspective of selected teachers and students from secondary schools in Slovakia. The research methods of the first phase (qualitative) of the research involved brainstorming among nine secondary school teachers. The second research phase (quantitative) used a questionnaire, which was completed by 102 high school students from all over Slovakia. The collection of both quantitative and qualitative data was used in this research. The research results revealed the most representative opinions of teachers on the current and real possibilities of engaging credible social media in online education and the views of high school students on their desired use and involvement of social media in online education. The intersection of the two findings presents a picture of the possibilities of using credible social media in online education, which can help maintain students interest in online education during a pandemic. Based on these findings, it can be stated that the opinions identified in the research group of teachers correspond to a large extent with the desired use of social media in education from the perspective of students. In addition, however, students would welcome more opportunities to use and engage social media in todays online education. The result of this research is an analysis of social media patterns applied to online education, which are of greater interest to students and could act as elements for reducing the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., six forms of online education and 24 educational activities that could contribute, inter alia, to mitigating the different negative effects of the pandemic among youth generation.

While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.","output":"Hand-hygiene mitigation strategies against global disease spreading through the air transportation network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": The creation of a European Data Space is one of the priorities of the Commission 2019-2025, including the health sector. A common European Health Data Space will promote better exchange and access to different types of health data (electronic health records, genomics data, data from patient registries, etc.), not only to support healthcare delivery (so-called primary use of data) but also for health research and health policy-making purposes (so-called secondary use of data). The COVID-19 pandemic has further underlined the importance of having timely access to health data within the Members States and across Europe. The EHDS would give a valuable contribution to research activities on new preventive strategies and effective treatments and medical devices, thus contributing to improving citizens' health and their quality of life. The European Health Data Space will require a common framework that should be based on three pillars: 1. a strong system of data governance and rules for data exchange; 2. data quality; 3. strong infrastructure and interoperability. A concerted effort is needed to overcome some of the difficulties that are arising and that relate to: different levels of health digitalization and infrastructure quality at national levels; fragmentation of data standards and limited interoperability between healthcare systems; limited access and operability due to legal (GDPR) issues. We believe there is an urgent need to discuss with relevant stakeholders about strategies to: Establish an appropriate legal and governance framework to cover the access to and exchange of health data for healthcare provision, research, policy-making and regulatory activities. Lower technical barriers hindering data use and re-use, in particular those related to infrastructure, interoperability, data quality and standards in the health field. Ensure access and control of patients and citizens over their own health data. The workshop's structure and content aim at accomplishing with the above by: 1) introducing the principles and potential of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) project, ii) providing contributions from stakeholders on the three pillars of the EHDS, stimulating the debate around current gaps in knowledge, as well as system and policy barriers to the design and implementation of the EHDS.

METHODS: For this study, we interviewed 101 operators of private agricultural lands in Maryland, USA, and used descriptive statistics and qualitative comparative analysis to investigate differences between the kinds of outreach events that adopters and non-adopters attended. RESULTS: Our results suggested that non-adopters, as compared to adopters, attended events that provided production-relevant information and were logistically easy to attend. Further, non-adopters were more selective when reading advertisements, generally preferring simplicity.

METHODS: Cross sectional educational attainment data (2009C2015) from students aged 15C16 years in Cardiff, Wales were linked to primary health care data, modelled air pollution and measured pollen data, and analysed using multilevel linear regression models. Annual cohort, school and individual level confounders were adjusted for in single and multi-pollutant/pollen models. We stratified by treatment of asthma and/or Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR). RESULTS: A unit (10g/m3) increase of short-term exposure to NO(2) was associated with 0.044 (95% CI: ?0.079, ?0.008) reduction of standardised Capped Point Score (CPS) after adjusting for individual and household risk factors for 18,241 students. This association remained statistically significant after controlling for other pollutants and pollen. There was no association of PM(2.5), O(3), or Pollen with standardised CPS remaining after adjustment. We found no evidence that treatment for asthma or SAR modified the observed NO(2) effect on educational attainment. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution, specifically NO(2,) was associated with detrimental educational attainment for students aged 15C16.

Methods We present a narrative review of studies published in PubMed since the beginning of the pandemic (January 2020CJuly 2021). Results Patients with history of COVID-19 have been found to present persistent neurological symptoms, including cognitive complaints, memory and concentration problems, headache, anosmia, ageusia, vertigo, and insomnia. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a heterogeneous disease that lacks a universally accepted definition, which may explain the great variability in the estimated prevalence (2.3%C85%) and symptom duration. The criteria differentiating post-COVID-19 syndrome from chronic fatigue syndrome or critical illness syndrome are ambiguous. Risk factors include older age, female sex, certain comorbidities, and greater number of symptoms in the acute phase. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is largely unknown, although it is probably multifactorial, including immunological mechanisms, neural network dysfunction, neurotransmitter alterations, persistent viral damage, and functional impairment.

Appellations for this clinical syndrome have included atypical pneumonia, infantile pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or nonbacterial pneumonia.(5) Despite this confusion of names, most clinicians are familiar with the clinical picture of a patient with a pneumonia that is not a typical lobar or lobular process as seen with pyogenic bacteria such a Streptococcus pneumoniae. 1.. Acute or subacute onset; 2.. Lack of fever or low-grade fever (< 102F); 3.. Clinical signs suggestive of a pulmonary process such as cough, tachypnea, or mild to moderate respiratory distress; 4.. Infiltrates on chest radiographs such as perihilar or interstitial infiltrates; 5.. Lack of evidence of on acute pyogenic bacterial process such as a normal or only mildly elevated white blood cell count and no response to -lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin or cephalosporins.(24.) This definition is intended to apply to the majority of children, but clearly there are exceptions. For instance, some infants with an atypical pneumonia present with fever. Terms that imply a etiologic agent such as nonbacterial pneumonia should be avoided because bacterial agents are actually common causes of afebrile pneumonia, as is discussed. This article focuses mainly on afebrile pneumonia in infants, in particular, those younger than 6 months of age. Comparison are made to pneumonia in older children.

The infection is highly contagious, has a high mortality rate, and its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Pulmonary inflammations with substantial lung damage together with generalized immune dysregulation are major components of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Of these two components, lung damage seems to be, at least in part, a consequence of immune dysregulation. This study revealed that these immune alterations are not merely an association, as it might occur in systemic infection, but, very likely, the core pathogenic element of COVID-19. In addition, management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. Herein, we have reviewed current evidence related to different aspects of COVID-19 immunology, including innate and adaptive immune responses against the virus and mechanisms of virus-induced immune dysregulation. Considering that an effective vaccine is not yet available to the public and current antiviral therapies are chiefly experimental, strategies do immunotherapy for the management of disease have also been reviewed. Understanding the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 is important to develop more effective immunotherapeutics, diagnostic, and prophylactic strategies in this disease.","output":"Immunology, Immunopathogenesis and Immunotherapeutics of COVID-19; an Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publisher regrets that the \\"The Neo-Covid StudyGroup\\" list of collaborators were not uploaded during processing of the original version of the above published article.","output":"Correction to: A multicenter study on epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 125 newborns born to women infected with COVID-19 by Turkish Neonatal Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The virus is common in patients with viral pneumonia. However, the viral etiology and clinical features of patients with viral pneumonia in China remain unclear. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the viral causes and epidemiology of patients with viral pneumonia in Beijing, which can significantly improve the pertinence and accuracy of clinical treatment of the disease. METHODS: Firstly, 1539 respiratory specimens of pneumonia (oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were collected from 19 hospitals in Beijing from September 2015 to August 2018. Then, TaqMan low-density microfluidic chip technology was used to detect viral pneumonia specimens in 1539 respiratory tract specimens of pneumonia and determine the types of viral bacteria in them. Lastly, the analysis of demographic, clinical and etiological data of patients with viral pneumonia was performed. RESULTS: The results showed that among the 1539 respiratory tract specimens with pneumonia, 760 were detected as viral pneumonia specimens, with a positive rate of 49.4%. Among which, 467 were infected with mono-viral and 293 were infected with multi-viral. Influenza A virus (Flu A), mycoplasma pneumoniae (MPn), Ebola virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were the major viral components in the samples of these patients. Furthermore, these viral species were significantly associated with sample sources, onset season and certain clinical characteristics.

We retrospectively analyzed COVID-19 related outcomes for hospitalized pts with SMs. Methods: We collected data on hospitalized pts with SMs and COVID-19 from 3/1/20 to Jan 1/1/21. Diagnosis COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed the association between the 30-day mortality and potential prognostic variables such as tumor types, cancer status, timing of treatment, types of anticancer therapy using logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 246 hospitalized pts with SMs had COVID-19. Median age was 70 years, 87 (35%) were 75 years, 151 (61%) were female. The most common SMs were breast (56 [23%]), non-small cell lung (44 [18%]) and colon (31 [13%]). 154 (63%) pts were on active anticancer therapies. Of those 88 (35.5%) received treatment within 2 weeks, 16 (16.5%) within 4-12 weeks, 99 (39.9%) >3 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. 101 (65%) pts received cytotoxic chemotherapies, 26 (16.8%) received immune check point inhibitors (ICIs), 17 (11%) received targeted agents such as anti-EGFR therapy and 11 (7.1%) received monoclonal antibodies. Overall 30-day mortality was 42%, however, all pts with melanoma (7/7) died. The 30-day mortalities for pts who received anticancer treatments within 4 weeks, 4-12 weeks and >12 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis were 47%, 50%, and 37%. For pts who never received treatment, 30-day mortality was 31%. For pts were in remission, stable disease and progressive disease, the 30-day mortalities were 32%, 35% and 62%. The 30-day mortalities for pts who received cytotoxic therapy, monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies and ICIs, were 38%, 46%, 41% and 69%. Logistic regression analysis showed that pts who were >80 years of age (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-8.1), had progressive disease (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.8-6.5) or treated with ICIs (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5-8.7) were associated with higher 30-day mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 associated 30-day mortality is high for hospitalized pts with SMs. Early surveillance of clinical deterioration could be helpful for hospitalized SMs pts with risk factors identified here.

Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression. Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables. Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals' mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders.

The only cure for GATA2 deficiency is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The inconsistency of genotypeCphenotype correlations makes the decision regarding who and when to transplant challenging. Despite considerable morbidity and mortality, the reported proportion of patients with GATA2 deficiency that has undergone allo-HSCT is low (~ 35%). The purpose of this study was to explore if detailed clinical, genetic, and bone marrow characteristics could predict end-point outcome, i.e., death and allo-HSCT. METHODS: All medical genetics departments in Norway were contacted to identify GATA2 deficient individuals. Clinical information, genetic variants, treatment, and outcome were subsequently retrieved from the patients medical records. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2020, we identified 10 index cases or probands, four additional symptomatic patients, and no asymptomatic patients with germline GATA2 variants. These patients had a diverse clinical phenotype dominated by cytopenia (13/14), myeloid neoplasia (10/14), warts (8/14), and hearing loss (7/14). No valid genotypeCphenotype correlations were found in our data set, and the phenotypes varied also within families. We found that 11/14 patients (79%), with known GATA2 deficiency, had already undergone allo-HSCT. In addition, one patient is awaiting allo-HSCT. The indications to perform allo-HSCT were myeloid neoplasia, disseminated viral infection, severe obliterating bronchiolitis, and/or HPV-associated in situ carcinoma. Two patients died, 8 months and 7 years after allo-HSCT, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our main conclusion is that the majority of patients with symptomatic GATA2 deficiency will need allo-HSCT, and a close surveillance of these patients is important to find the optimal window for allo-HSCT. We advocate a more offensive approach to allo-HSCT than previously described.

The current study explores the potential barriers and facilitators general practitioners experienced to expanding triage systems and their attitudes towards triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A mixed-method study design was used in which a quantitative online survey was conducted along with qualitative interviews to gain a more nuanced appreciation for practitioners experiences in the United Kingdom. The survey items were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework so they would capture 14 behavioral factors that may influence whether practitioners use triage systems. Items were responded to using seven-point Likert scales. A median score was calculated for each item. The responses of participants identifying as part-owners and non-owners (i.e., partner vs. non-partner practitioners) were compared. The semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely and examined using Braun and Clarks thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 204 participants (66% Female). Most participants (83%) reported triaging patients. The items with the highest median scores captured the Knowledge, Skills, Social/Professional role and identity, and Beliefs about capabilities domains. The items with the lowest median scores captured the Beliefs about consequences, Goals, and Emotions domains. For 14 of the 17 items, partner scores were higher than non-partner scores. All the qualitative interview participants relied on a phone triage system. Six broad themes were discovered: patient accessibility, confusions around what triage is, uncertainty and risk, relationships between service providers, job satisfaction, and the potential for total digital triage. Suggestions arose to optimize triage, such as ensuring there is sufficient time to conduct triage accurately and providing practical training to use triage efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Many general practitioners are engaging with expanded triage systems, though more support is needed to achieve total triage across practices. Non-partner practitioners likely require more support to use the triage systems that practices take up. Additionally, practical support should be made available to help all practitioners manage the new risks and uncertainties they are likely to experience during non-face-to-face consultations.

Infection with the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) impairs oxygen diffusion capacity of the lung and in consequence causes hypoxemia. In 20 - 40 % of COVID-19 cases, patients have alarmingly low oxygen (O2 ) saturation of the blood without being dyspneic, a condition called \\"silent hypoxia\\".1 However, hypoxemia leads to severe injuries in diverse organs, particularly those of high oxygen dependency such as the brain, heart or kidney.1 Tissue hypoxia results from an imbalance between O2 consumption and O2 delivery.2 Insufficient oxygen supply forces cells to adapt via multiple physiological processes as has been extensively reported in Acta Physiologica (Oxf.).3-5 In general, but also in the context of COVID-19, the basic understanding of cellular O2 availability represents a major topic.6-8 The final amount of oxygen reaching the cell, or more precisely the mitochondria for oxidative metabolism, is mainly attributed to i) the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood as determined by the haemoglobin (Hb) level, and ii) the ability to release O2 to the tissue as determined by the Hb-O2 affinity. The latter may belong to the physiological knowledge that is underestimated in clinical routine, as indicated by only few investigations in this regard. However, due to the risk of thrombotic events, the issue of Hb-O2 affinity might be of exceptional relevance in COVID-19 and silent hypoxia.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 182 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in Milan, from 16 March to 30 April 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Results: Asymptomatic HCWs were 17.6% (32/182), and 58 healed at 30 April 2020. The median time length of negativization was 4 weeks (35% of symptomatic versus 40% of asymptomatic HCWs). Four HCWs, healed at 30 April, turned positive within three weeks during controls set up in the work unit. Three-gene positivity had the greatest variability, and increasing CT values from single- to three-gene positivity among all age groups were observed.

METHODS Fourteen TCA cases treated between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed. Open D/S (O-D/S) through a vertical midline abdominal incision was routine from 1990 to 2005, whereupon Lap-D became routine. Lap-D involves laparoscopic colon resection, ileostomy take-down, and ileum pull-through through an additional Pfannenstiel incision. We compared pre-operative nutrition, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, duration until oral challenge, postoperative analgesic usage, incidence of enterocolitis, early complications that arose within 30 days of surgery, and late complications, and wound cosmesis 1 year postoperatively (Grade-1: unacceptable, Grade-2: passable, Grade-3: excellent). RESULTS Six had O-D/S (2D, 4S) and eight had Lap-D. Differences in patient demographics, mean ages/weights at surgery, average length of the aganglionic segment from the terminal ileum, operating time, and time taken for oral challenge were all not significant, full feeding took longer in O-D/S (6.7 vs. 5.9 days). Preoperative central vein intravenous hyperalimentation was required for one case in O-D/S and two cases in Lap-D. These three required hospitalization for at least 30 days postoperatively and parenteral nutrition after discharge. Although there were no intraoperative complications in either group, there was one case of transient ileus in O-D/S that resolved conservatively. Cosmesis was significantly better in Lap-D (O-D/S = 1.2; Lap-D = 2.1; p < 0.05).

In Southeast Asia, national governments and businesses seeking to expedite economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession have selectively re-opened borders by accelerating production and revitalizing agro-export growth. Widening regional inequities have also contributed to increased cross-border flows of illicit commodities, such as trafficked wildlife. At the same time, border restrictions under the exigencies of controlling the pandemic have led to a rolling back and scaling down of transboundary environmental agreements, regulations and programs, with important implications for environmental democracy, socio-ecological justice and sustainability.

However, there are few studies in Nigeria on how EM practices have been used in the hotel industry for their survival and growth. The study examines the customer-centric influence of EM on business performance of hotels in Nigeria during the COVID-19 crisis. Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected primary data from 578 owner-managers and top managers of 66 hotels in Lagos and Yola in Nigeria using structured questionnaires. Respondents were selected based on the purposive sampling technique. The data collected were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics with the aid of statistical package for social sciences (SPSS Version 21). Three regression estimations are reported. The estimation in model 1 indicates that calculated risk-taking dimension has a significant positive influence on general performance, while the proactiveness, innovativeness, value creation, resource leveraging, opportunity to focus and customer intensity dimensions do not. The estimation in model 2 suggests that calculated risk-taking and customer intensity dimensions have a significant positive influence on revenue per room, while the other five EM dimensions do not. The estimation in model 3 indicates that calculated risk-taking dimension has a significant positive influence on market share, while the six EM dimensions do not. The owner-mangers and top managers of hotels should fortify and upscale the weak EM dimensions as a resilience strategy for recovery from the ravages of the COVID-19 crisis. We bridge the gaps in the literature by providing interesting insights into the potential value of the adoption of EM as a post-COVID-19 recovery strategy by the hotel segment of the hospitality industry in the developing context of Nigeria.

The use of tele-mental health services is a critical resource for reaching individuals who need access to mental health services, whether due to challenges with distance, lack of local provider access, or a result of stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19. This study compared the use and type of tele-mental health services (medical vs. nonmedical) administered for the three mental health diagnosis sets by rural versus urban geography. A retrospective study was conducted during a 16-month study period (November 2019-February 2021) using a large health system database to examine the use of tele-mental health services for three mental health diagnosis sets: adjustment disorder, anxiety, and depression. The utilization of tele-mental health services was evaluated across urban and rural lines, by medical versus nonmedical visit type, and additionally by broadband availability. After a brief initial rise, rural communities saw a steeper decline in tele-mental health service utilization relative to their urban counterparts, even as rural communities experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases. This is potentially an indication that rural areas may be slower to adapt to tele-mental health delivery of care relative to their urban counterparts. Consistent with the evidence base on rural-urban health and socioeconomic disparity, the study team found that rural areas lag compared to their urban counterparts in accommodating tele-mental health technology for health emergencies. It is important for health services researchers to investigate the technological as well as nontechnological factors related to sustained tele-mental health utilization.

The SRTRPE monitors running velocity (v), heart rate (HRex), and blood lactate concentration (B[La]), during three 3-minute stages prescribed by ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) of 10, 13, and 17. METHODS: Forty (14 female) trained endurance runners completed a treadmill graded exercise test for the determination of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), v at VO2max (vVO2max), and v at 2 mmolL-1 (vLT1) and 4 mmolL-1 (vLT2) B[La]. Within 7 days, participants completed the SRTRPE. Convergent validity between the SRTRPE and graded exercise test parameters was assessed through linear regression. Eleven participants completed a further 2 trials of the SRTRPE within a 72-hour period to quantify test-retest reliability. RESULTS: There were large correlations between v at all stages of the SRTRPE and VO2max (r range = .57-.63), vVO2max (.50-.66), and vLT2 (.51-.62), with vRPE 17 displaying the strongest associations (r > .60).

As frontline health care workers are essential in battling the pandemic and their work is appreciated in society, we argue that health care workers who are forced to work from home are likely to perceive their jobs as less meaningful, which in turn may negatively affect their engagement at work. Cognitive crafting, or the altering of the perceptions one has about their tasks and relationships with the aim to enhance the meaningfulness of work, may be a fruitful cognitive strategy to counter the problems remote health care workers face. PURPOSE The primary purpose was to study the relationship between cognitive crafting, working from home (WFH), and work engagement. METHODOLOGY We collected cross-sectional survey data between May 7 and June 2, 2020, from a single hospital in the Netherlands (n = 278). The central hypothesis was tested using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS The relationship between cognitive crafting and work engagement was moderated by WFH, such that the relationship is more positive for health care workers who work from home permanently since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic than for frontline workers and workers who work partially from home. CONCLUSION Our findings are consistent with previous research on cognitive crafting. We conclude that cognitive crafting is an interesting cognitive strategy to stay engaged for health care workers who are mandated into WFH. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS We advise organizations to provide remote workers virtual group trainings that promote cognitive crafting and expose them to testimonies of people who are positively affected by their work. More generally, we recommend organizations to engage in effective top-down work design and foster a climate for cognitive as well as behavioral job crafting strategies.","output":"Cognitive crafting and work engagement: A study among remote and frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Studies link racism to higher mortality rates, earlier onset of more severe diseases, and higher comorbidity and impairment This article explores nursing education as an upstream intervention to addressing racial inequities Method: Six recommendations were created to guide the praxis of anti-racism in nursing education The recommendations were based on examination of nursing literature and draw on experiences of the author Results: These recommendations include the following: adopt an explicitly anti-racist position, include everyone, institute a power and privilege course for all incoming students, implement intersectionality as a core competency, foster community-academic partnership, and utilize transdisciplinary resources Conclusion: There are no quick fixes to health inequities;they are rooted in racism and discrimination that have been woven into the fabric of American society However, by implementing the outlined recommendations, schools of nursing, and their nurse educators, can prepare the future workforce to be change agents [J Nurs Educ 2020;59(11):642C645 ]","output":"Anti-Racism in Nursing Education: Recommendations for Racial Justice Praxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with the Covid\\\\19 pandemic, universities in Turkey as well as all over the world have started to carry out their education activities with the distance education method.

As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality.Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk.

In vitro experiments were performed on human microvascular endothelial cells from the derma and lung exposed to SARS-CoV-2-derived spike protein 1 (S1). The expression of adhesive molecules was studied by immunofluorescence and leukocyte adhesion and platelet aggregation were assessed under flow conditions. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and AMPK expression were investigated by Western Blot analysis. In addition, S1-treated endothelial cells were incubated with anti-ACE2 blocking antibody, AMPK agonist, or complement inhibitors. Our results show that significant levels of spike protein were found in the 30.4% of severe COVID-19 patients. In vitro, the activation of endothelial cells with S1 protein, via ACE2, impaired AMPK signalling, leading to robust leukocyte recruitment due to increased adhesive molecule expression and thrombomodulin loss. This S1-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype led to exuberant C3 and C5b-9 deposition on endothelial cells, along with C3a and C5a generation that further amplified S1-induced complement activation. Functional blockade of ACE2 or complement inhibition halted S1-induced platelet aggregates by limiting von Willebrand factor and P-selectin exocytosis and expression on endothelial cells. Overall, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-derived S1 is sufficient in itself to propagate inflammatory and thrombogenic processes in the microvasculature, amplified by the complement system, recapitulating the thromboembolic complications of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein 1 Activates Microvascular Endothelial Cells and Complement System Leading to Platelet Aggregation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mimics the influenza A (H1N1) virus in terms of clinical presentation, transmission mechanism, and seasonal coincidence. Comprehensive data for the clinical severity of adult patients co-infected by both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, and, particularly, the relationship with PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values are not yet available. All participants in this study were tested for H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously at admission. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared among adults hospitalized for H1N1 infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection and co-infection with both viruses. Ct values for viral RNA detection were further compared within SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection groups. Score on seven-category ordinal scale of clinical status at day 7 and day 14 were assessed. Among patients with monoinfection, H1N1 infection had higher frequency of onset symptoms but lower incidence of adverse events during hospitalization than SAR-CoV-2 infection (P < 0.05). Co-infection had an increased odds of acute kidney injury, acute heart failure, secondary bacterial infections, multilobar infiltrates and admittance to ICU than monoinfection. Score on seven-category scale at day 7 and day 14 was higher in patients with coinfection than patients with SAR-CoV-2 monoinfection (P<0.05). Co-infected patients had lower initial Ct values (referring to higher viral load) (median 32) than patients with SAR-CoV-2 monoinfection (median 36). Among co-infected patients, low Ct values were significantly and positively correlated with acute kidney injury and ARDS (P = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Co-infection by SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 caused more severe disease than monoinfection by either virus in adult inpatients. Early Ct value could provide clues for the later trajectory of the co-infection. Multiplex molecular diagnostics for both viruses and early assessment of SAR-CoV-2 Ct values are recommended to achieve optimal treatment for improved clinical outcome.","output":"Clinical and virological impact of single and dual infections with influenza A (H1N1) and SARS-CoV-2 in adult inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic-2020 has come quite unexpectedly despite the repeated warnings from WHO.

We sought to understand willingness to use actual and hypothetical HIV prevention methods among participants enrolled in a preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Soweto, South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study with 38 self-reporting HIV-uninfected and consenting 18C35 year olds participating in the HVTN 702 vaccine efficacy trial in Soweto. Using a semi-structured interview guide, five focus group discussions (FGDs) were held, stratified by age, gender and sexual orientation. The FGDs were composed of: (i) 10 heterosexual women aged 18C24 years; (ii) 9 heterosexual and bisexual women aged 25C35 years; (iii & iv) heterosexual men aged 25C35 years with 7 in both groups; and (v) 5 men aged 18C35 years who have sex with men. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated into English and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We present five main themes: (i) long-lasting methods are preferable; (ii) condoms are well-known but not preferred for use; (iii) administration route of HIV prevention method is a consideration for the user; (iv) ideal HIV prevention methods should blend into the lifestyle of the user; and the perception that (v) visible prevention methods indicate sexual indiscretion. CONCLUSIONS: The participants candour about barriers to condom and daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and expressed preferences for long-lasting, discreet, lifestyle-friendly methods reveal a gap in the biomedical prevention market aiming to reduce sexually acquired HIV in South Africa.

Method: In Study 1, we describe the development and validation of the instrument, through an iterative procedure in which manual annotation of independent subsamples (n = 24, 25) by human coders was compared to the computer coding in subsequent rounds, until sufficient agreement was reached. In Study 2, we illustrate the type of data that the script generates, by analyzing the prevalence of the three perspectives in annual reports of 55 Dutch organizations over a period of 2 decades (1999-2018; n = 937). Results: Our findings confirm that DivPAR is sufficiently reliable for use in future research. In Study 2, we show that among Dutch organizations, the moral perspective is most prevalent, but the market and innovation perspectives are increasing in popularity. Conclusion: DivPAR can be used to analyze the prevalence and longitudinal development of diversity perspectives in organizational communication.

However, exuberant immune response with features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) lead detrimental consequences in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin (IL)-18 is one of the leading cytokines in MAS which has not been studied in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of IL-18 with the other inflammatory markers and disease severity in COVID-19 for predicting disease prognosis. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 who had confirmed diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR were enrolled into the study. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, and laboratory values of CRP, ferritin, d-dimer and procalcitonin were measured on admission. Patients were followed up prospectively with a standardized approach until hospital discharge or death. Individuals were classified as asymptomatic, mild and severe pneumonia according to their clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Worse outcome was defined as requirement of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Blood samples were collected at enrollment and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-18 were determined by ELISA. Association between IL-18 and other inflammatory markers and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 58 COVID-19 patients (50% male) with a median age of 43 (min 22-max 81) years. Twenty age and sex matched healthy subjects were served as control group. The study population was divided into three groups according to disease severity: asymptomatic (n = 20), mild pneumonia group (n = 27) and a severe group (n = 11). During follow up nine (15.5%) patients required ICU admission and three of them were died eventually. Serum IL-18 were correlated with other inflammatory markers and biochemical markers of organ injury; creatinine, liver enzymes and troponin. Serum IL-18 levels were remarkably higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects with being highest in severe pneumonia group (p < 0.001). IL-18 serum concentrations were almost four-fold higher in patients with worse outcome compared to good outcome (p < 0.001). Serum IL-18 above the cut off value of 576 pg/mL on admission was associated with 11.7 fold increased risk of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The serum concentrations of IL-18 correlate with other inflammatory markers and reflect disease severity. Results of the present study shed light on role of IL-18 on COVID-19 pathogenesis and might provide an evidence for the clinical trials on IL-18 antagonists for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Prognostic value of interleukin-18 and its association with other inflammatory markers and disease severity in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A deeper understanding of the processes leading to problem framing and behind finding solutions to problems should help explain variability in the quality of the solutions to those problems.

Our analysis is highly pertinent given that the World Health Organisation acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recognises that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur. In our theoretical treatment, the virion is assimilated to a core-shell nanoparticle, and contributions of various interaction energies to the virion-PM association (electrostatic, hydrophobic, London-van der Waals, etc.) are generically included. We review the limited available literature on the physicochemical features of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and identify knowledge gaps. Despite the lack of quantitative data, our conceptual framework qualitatively predicts that virion-PM entities are largely able to maintain equilibrium on the timescale of their diffusion towards the host cell surface. Comparison of the relevant mass transport coefficients reveals that virion biointernalization demand by alveolar host cells may be greater than the diffusive supply. Under such conditions both the free and PM-sorbed virions may contribute to the transmitted dose. This result points to the potential for PM to serve as a shuttle for delivery of virions to host cell targets. Thus, our critical review reveals that the chemodynamics of virion-PM interactions may play a crucial role in the transmission of COVID-19, and provides a sound basis for explaining reported correlations between episodes of air pollution and outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"Chemodynamic features of nanoparticles: Application to understanding the dynamic life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and aqueous biointerfacial zones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Physical inactivity is a global public health challenge. Physical activity (PA) promotion in healthcare delivery systems is effective to reduce physical inactivity. A primary care setting provides an appropriate environment for PA counseling since it is a primary contact with primary care or family physicians encounter the majority of the population. Lack of knowledge and inadequate training in PA counseling is one of the most important barriers to PA promotion. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate PA counseling training in primary care residency programs. METHODS The authors systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Library for articles published in English from 2000 to 2017. Articles regarding PA counseling in primary care residency training were extracted and outcomes assessed for this systematic review. RESULTS Based on the initial review, 378 articles were excluded (362 articles excluded based on titles and abstracts and 16 articles excluded based on full texts). Four articles were included in this review, addressed PA counseling curricula in primary care residency training. All studies included PA counseling training as part of obesity and healthy lifestyle training. The training improved knowledge among primary care residents, but may not necessarily result in better attitudes or self-efficacy, which could be improved by elective rotations that focus on improved attitudes, self-efficacy, and professional norms for PA counseling. Brief training in counseling did not improve quality nor increase the rate of counseling. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review demonstrates a lack of evidence due to a small number of included studies. The heterogeneous outcomes from the minimal programs are needed to carefully interpret. However, this review sheds light on the importance of training in PA counseling in primary care residency programs. The development of training in PA counseling should focus on an approach that improves attitudes and the self-efficacy of primary care residents. Elective rotations, where residents voluntarily choose their subject, may provide the appropriate training period for PA counseling.

Although GOAT is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and diabetes and plays a key role in other physiologic processes, little is known about its structure or mechanism. GOAT is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, a group of polytopic integral membrane proteins involved in lipid-biosynthetic and lipid-signaling reactions from prokaryotes to humans. Here we use phylogeny and a variety of bioinformatic tools to predict the topology of GOAT. Using selective permeabilization indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with glycosylation shift immunoblotting, we demonstrate that GOAT contains 11 transmembrane helices and one reentrant loop. Development of the V5Glyc tag, a novel, small, and sensitive dual topology reporter, facilitated these experiments. The MBOAT family invariant residue His-338 is in the ER lumen, consistent with other family members, but conserved Asn-307 is cytosolic, making it unlikely that both are involved in catalysis. Photocross-linking of synthetic ghrelin analogs and inhibitors demonstrates binding to the C-terminal region of GOAT, consistent with a role of His-338 in the active site. This knowledge of GOAT architecture is important for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of GOAT and other MBOATs and could ultimately advance the discovery of selective inhibitors for these enzymes.","output":"Architectural organization of the metabolic regulatory enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of over one million people worldwide, and has affected all aspects of healthcare worldwide, including the delivery of care to patients with fertility-related diagnoses.

Here, we present an in-depth analysis of clinical, whole-exome, transcriptome, and ctDNA profiles of 73 patients with advanced solid tumors, across 30 cancer types, from a phase II basket clinical trial of pembrolizumab (NCT02644369) and report changes in genomic and immune landscapes (primary outcomes). Patients stratified by ctDNA and tumor burden dynamics correspond with survival and clinical benefit. High mutation burden, high expression of immune signatures, and mutations in BRCA2 are associated with pembrolizumab molecular sensitivity, while abundant copy-number alterations and B2M loss-of-heterozygosity corresponded with resistance. Upon treatment, induction of genes expressed by T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell populations are consistent with sensitivity and resistance. We identified the upregulated expression of PLA2G2D, an immune-regulating phospholipase, as a potential biomarker of adaptive resistance to ICB.

However, these measures could potentially lead to adverse outcomes such as decreased mental wellbeing in patients and staff. A recent publication by Public Health England examines the effectiveness of IPC practices for reducing COVID-19 transmission in care homes (Duval et al., 2021). We explore evidence relating to adverse outcomes from IPC practices to help inform policy recommendations and identify gaps within the literature where further research can be prioritised. Key Findings Extent of the evidence base 15 studies were identified: 14 primary studies and one rapid review Recency of the evidence base Of the primary studies, six were published in 2020 and eight were published in 2021 The rapid review was published in 2021. Summary of findings This rapid review focuses on adverse outcomes resulting from increased IPC measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst there is some evidence to show that there may be a link between IPC measures and adverse outcomes, causation cannot be assumed. During the COVID-19 restrictions, the cognition, mental wellbeing and behaviour of residents in care homes were negatively affected Increased IPC procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic increased stress and burden among care staff because of increased workload and dilemmas between adhering well to IPC procedures and providing the best care for the care recipients COVID-19 IPC procedures were not well developed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but evidence from 2021 suggests that good adherence to IPC measures can enable visitations by family members and medical professionals into care homes Only one study investigating domiciliary care was found. Therefore, it is difficult to make conclusions related specifically to this care setting No published studies have reported on the costs or cost-effectiveness of IPC measures or have explored the cost implications of adverse outcomes associated with IPC measures Best quality evidence Only one study was deemed as high quality based on the quality appraisal checklist ranking. This was a mixed methods study design (Tulloch et al., 2021). Policy Implications Since March 2020, there have been many changes to government guidelines relating to procedures to keep the population safe from COVID-19 harm. Policies vary according to country, even within the UK. Important issues such as care home visitation policies have changed in such a way that care home staff have felt it difficult to keep up with the changes, which in itself increased the burden on those staff. The following implications were identified from this work: IPC policies should be clear, concise and tailored to care homes and domiciliary care settings Increased attention to workforce planning is needed to ensure adequate staffing and to reduce individual burden Restrictions (e.g. visitation) for care home residents needs to be balanced by additional psychological support Further research with robust methods in this area is urgently needed especially in the domiciliary care setting Strength of Evidence One limitation is the lack of high-quality evidence from the included studies. Confidence in the strength of evidence about adverse outcomes of COVID-19 IPC procedures was rated as low overall. Whilst the majority of studies achieved a moderate score based on the quality appraisal tools used, due to the nature of the methods used, the overall quality of evidence is low.","output":"Have infection control and prevention measures resulted in any adverse outcomes for care home and domiciliary care residents and staff?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has primarily been reported as a respiratory illness, but involvement of other organ systems has been reported.

This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogot city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","output":"INFEKTA-An agent-based model for transmission of infectious diseases: The COVID-19 case in Bogot, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The curriculum is at the heart of education.

For example, this enables neural network training for COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray (CXR) images without collecting patient CXR data across multiple hospitals. Unfortunately, the exchange of the weights quickly consumes the network bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed. So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural network into a client and a server part, so that the client part of the network takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not clear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network performance. To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct strengths, here we show that the Vision Transformer, a recently developed deep learning architecture with straightforward decomposable configuration, is ideally suitable for split learning without sacrificing performance. Even under the non-independent and identically distributed data distribution which emulates a real collaboration between hospitals using CXR datasets from multiple sources, the proposed framework was able to attain performance comparable to data-centralized training. In addition, the proposed framework along with heterogeneous multi-task clients also improves individual task performances including the diagnosis of COVID-19, eliminating the need for sharing large weights with innumerable parameters.

By the end of November 2021, it had spread and approached fixation in South Africa, and had been detected on all continents. We analyzed the exponential growth of Omicron over four-week periods in the two most populated of South Africas provinces, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, arriving at the doubling time estimates of, respectively, 3.3 days (95% CI: 3.2C3.4 days) and 2.7 days (95% CI: 2.3C3.3 days). Similar or even shorter doubling times were observed in other locations: Australia (3.0 days), New York State (2.5 days), UK (2.4 days), and Denmark (2.0 days). LogClinear regression suggests that the spread began in Gauteng around 11 October 2021; however, due to presumable stochasticity in the initial spread, this estimate can be inaccurate. Phylogenetics-based analysis indicates that the Omicron strain started to diverge between 6 October and 29 October 2021. We estimated that the weekly growth of the ratio of Omicron to Delta is in the range of 7.2C10.2, considerably higher than the growth of the ratio of Delta to Alpha (estimated to be in in the range of 2.5C4.2), and Alpha to pre-existing strains (estimated to be in the range of 1.8C2.7). High relative growth does not necessarily imply higher Omicron infectivity. A two-strain SEIR model suggests that the growth advantage of Omicron may stem from immune evasion, which permits this VOC to infect both recovered and fully vaccinated individuals.

In this group of patients with HS, 46.3% were black, compared with 7.0% of patients attending general dermatology clinics (P < 0.001). The majority (65.9%) of patients had previously received or were currently taking adalimumab. All consultations were performed by telephone and in 50.7% of the consultations, patients were assessed as having unstable (u)HS, with 81.1% of these uHS episodes leading to a change in pharmacological therapy. The decision-making process was aided by patient-submitted photographs at only 8.1% of consultations involving uHS, for reasons of patient privacy, comfort and data security. The data suggest that HS is an inherently unstable disease despite maximal medical therapy, and this study highlights important reasons for the assessment of patients with HS by FTF consultations where safely possible.","output":"Remote consultations for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and objectives: Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor-blocking agent proposed for the treatment of severe COVID-19; however, limited data are available on their efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tocilizumab on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by using propensity-score-matching (PSM) analysis. Methods: A retrospective observational analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients admitted to the Vall dHebron Hospital was performed between March and April 2020. We used the logistic regression to analyze the effect of tocilizumab on mortality, as main outcome, and PSM analysis to further validate their effect. Secondary outcomes were length-of-stay (LOS) and intensive-care-unit (ICU) stay. Same outcomes were also assessed for early tocilizumab administration, within 72h after admission. Patients were selected by matching their individual propensity for receiving therapy with tocilizumab, conditional on their demographic and clinical variables. Results: A total of 544 COVID-19 patients were included, 197 (36.2%) were treated with tocilizumab of whom 147 were treated within the first 72h after admission; and 347 were included in the control group. After PSM analyses, the results showed no association between tocilizumab use and overall mortality (OR=1.03, 95%CI: 0.63-1.68). However, shorter ICU-stay in the tocilizumab group was found compared to the control group (Coefficient -4.27 95%CI: -6.63- -1.92). Similar results were found in the early tocilizumab cohort. Conclusions: The administration of tocilizumab in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 did not reduce the risk of mortality in our cohort of patients, regardless of the time of administration.","output":"Effect of tocilizumab in adults hospitalized with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia versus standard care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAnaemia affects roughly a third of the worlds population;half the cases are due to iron deficiency.

In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism.

However, more data are needed to establish the strength of these methods by benchmarking against the current gold standard methods, core-needle biopsy (CNB) or surgical excision of the tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors were prospectively recruited. We performed mutation profiling using matched tumor DNA obtained by CNB, FNB and liquid biopsy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight custom mass-spectrometry or targeted next-generation DNA sequencing. The actionability of detected mutations was determined using the OncoKB Web tool. Agreement between mutations detected in CNBs, FNBs, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was examined. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent tumor biopsy. Thirty CNBs (73%) and 34 FNBs (83%) had sufficient tumor and DNA for mutation profiling. Median DNA yield from CNB and FNB were 775 ng (interquartile range, 240 to 347 4ng) and 649 ng (interquartile range, 180 to1350 ng), respectively.

Frankls (in the 1950s) and J. Franks (in the 1970s) historical definitions of the constructs Meaning in Life (MiL) and demoralization, there have been a multitude of studies which have described them from different theoretical perspectives. These constructs are closely linked, with the lack of MiL as one of the subconstructs underlying the definition of demoralization. Numerous studies have shown that MiL and demoralization affect suicidality, as protective and risk factors, respectively. The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS) is a more recent framework conceptualized by T. Joiner (in the 2000s) to provide an additional possible reading key in the effort to better understand suicidality. By analogy to a previous study by E. Kleiman & J. Beaver (2013), examining MiL and demoralization in suicidality through a perspective of the IPTS framework can be of considerable interest. This study showed, in a cohort of undergraduate students, that MiL mediated the relationship between two variables associated with IPTS (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness) and suicidal ideation (SI). Taking into consideration future studies that these latter authors advocated, our aim is to verify this finding using a cross-sectional study. Differences in our approach would include a) studying a clinical population (suicidal patients attending an emergency department), b) analyzing relationships not only with SI but also with suicidal attempts (SA), and c) in consideration of the interconnection between MiL and demoralization, exploring also the possible role of demoralization as a mediator.

We examined the associations of SNa (continuous and tertiles) on admission with: (1) patient symptoms obtained from detailed chart review; and (2) in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. Covariates included demographic data and comorbidities. RESULTS: Mean age was 60 years, 48% were male, and 35% had diabetes. The most frequent symptoms were cough (64%), fever (60%), and shortness of breath (56%).

It is imperative that medical trainees understand the implications of climate change/planetary health on the physical and mental health and well-being of their patients. Medical professionals generally are not trained to consider climate change impacts in patient encounters. Hence, there is a need to train climate-aware providers who will be at the forefront of patient care in managing these current and emerging health impacts. METHODS: We created a standardized patient (SP) case enhanced with details of risks and health impacts due to exposure to wildfire smoke. This session was deployed to 11 internal medicine clerkship students as part of a standard OSCE already included in our curriculum to evaluate core clinical and communication skills. Two cohorts, a group activity, and a one-on-one encounter were deployed and followed with a faculty debrief and learner assessments. RESULTS: Students had increased awareness and knowledge of health impacts of climate change and potential actions for adaptation and mitigation. The improvements were statistically significant for the one-on-one cohort (p = .006). Postsimulation comments were favorable; students were more inclined to consider health impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities exacerbated by climate change. DISCUSSION: Students had an increased recognition of climate change as a force impacting their patients' health which should be considered in patient care. This format allowed retention of well established curricular content, but also the inclusion of other crucial emerging issues that will impact public health locally and globally and foster the development of climate-aware health care providers.","output":"Asthma Exacerbation Triggered by Wildfire: A Standardized Patient Case to Integrate Climate Change Into Medical Curricula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in the rehabilitation of patients with functional ankle instability (FAI).

Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese governments progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnams response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies. METHODS: The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnams country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database Vietnam Laws Repository (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020. RESULTS: Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 C related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese governments prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemics progression. CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings.

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an alternative molecular assay and is potentially able to overcome some intrinsic shortcomings of RT-PCR. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the novel HG COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay. In this retrospective analysis, a total of 400 routinely collected leftover nasopharyngeal samples with a known RT-PCR result were tested by means of the HG COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay. The overall sensitivity and specificity values of HG COVID-19 RT-LAMP versus RT-PCR were 97.0% (95% CI: 93.6C98.9%) and 98.5% (95% CI: 95.7C99.7%), respectively. Inter-assay agreement was almost perfect (  = 0.96). Concordance was perfect in samples with high viral loads (cycle threshold <30). The average time to a positive result on RT-LAMP was 17 min. HG COVID-19 RT-LAMP is a reliable molecular diagnostic kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and its performance is comparable to that of RT-PCR. Shorter turnaround times and the possibility of performing molecular diagnostics in the point-of-care setting make it a valuable option for facilities without sophisticated laboratory equipment.","output":"High diagnostic performance of a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) kit for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Even though flow-diverting stents are being increasingly used to treat intracranial aneurysms, the fate of jailed side branches remains controversial, with recent clinical data contradicting finding of earlier animal studies that reported patency. OBJECTIVE To quantify the surface area of the ostia after 3 months of jailing by flow-diverting stents as a more accurate means of patency evaluation. METHODS Ten large white swine were stented by flow-diverting stents placed at common carotid-ascending pharyngeal arterial bifurcation sites. A dual antiplatelet regimen was initiated 72 hours before stenting and maintained during follow-up. Optical coherence tomography was used to search for per-procedural thrombus formation. Selective control digital subtraction angiography was performed 12 weeks post-stenting. Subsequently, the stented arterial segments were harvested en bloc and observed under scanning electron microscopy, photographed, and quantified. RESULTS The absence of per-procedural thrombus formation was confirmed. All ostia were patent at 12 weeks (or 3 months) post stenting, with no angiographic or scanning electron microscopy-evident thrombus formation. The mean initial ostium surface was 2 048 617  731 625 m. At 3 months, the mean nonendothelialized ostium surface was 229 218  140 172 m, and mean endothelialized ostium surface was 1 819 399  672 632 m. A statistically significant difference (reduction) was observed between the initial and 12-week ostium surfaces (P < .001), with an significant statistical power (1.000). CONCLUSION Jailed side branches remained patent after stenting, but the surface quantifications showed significant endothelial coverage, with a significant reduction of patent ostium surfaces at 12 weeks post-stenting.

We consider those narratives as community resilience builders, accounting for municipalities? educational strategies that enhanced locally anchored responses. If those actions represent an opportunity for local-governing new protagonism, they also generate a footprint for encouraging transformative resilience grounded in situated literacies and new educational audiences.

Based on the social compensation hypothesis, however, factors related to social fears could lead to problematic social networking site (SNS) use because individuals try to compensate for their offline popularity. It was shown that individuals with higher levels of social fears tend to prefer computer-mediated (CMC) instead of face to face (FTF) communication. Here, we aimed to create a model that shows the direct and indirect effects of social anxiety and self-esteem on problematic SNS use. A total of 215 participants filled out our survey including measures of social anxiety, self-esteem, fear of negative evaluation, social media and Internet addiction. Using structural equation modeling we tested the indirect and direct effects between the variables. Our results indicated that social anxiety and lower self-esteem could lead to favoring CMC over FTF communication, which may result in problematic internet (PIU) and SNS use as a compensatory behavior to cope with fear of negative evaluation. The indirect pathways might highlight relevant differences behind the motivation of PIU - anonymity - and problematic SNS use - control.

We determined the association between temperature trajectories and distinct manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Four hospitals within an academic healthcare system from March 2020 to February 2021. PATIENTS: All adult patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Using a validated group-based trajectory model, we classified patients into four previously defined temperature trajectory subphenotypes using oral temperature measurements from the first 72 hours of hospitalization. Clinical characteristics, biomarkers, and outcomes were compared between subphenotypes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 5,903 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients were classified into four subphenotypes: hyperthermic slow resolvers (n = 1,452, 25%), hyperthermic fast resolvers (1,469, 25%), normothermics (2,126, 36%), and hypothermics (856, 15%). Hypothermics had abnormal coagulation markers, with the highest d-dimer and fibrin monomers (p < 0.001) and the highest prevalence of cerebrovascular accidents (10%, p = 0.001). The prevalence of venous thromboembolism was significantly different between subphenotypes (p = 0.005), with the highest rate in hypothermics (8.5%) and lowest in hyperthermic slow resolvers (5.1%). Hyperthermic slow resolvers had abnormal inflammatory markers, with the highest C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleukin-6 (p < 0.001). Hyperthermic slow resolvers had increased odds of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and 30-day inpatient mortality (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13C2.19) compared with hyperthermic fast resolvers. Over the course of the pandemic, we observed a drastic decrease in the prevalence of hyperthermic slow resolvers, from representing 53% of admissions in March 2020 to less than 15% by 2021. We found that dexamethasone use was associated with significant reduction in probability of hyperthermic slow resolvers membership (27% reduction; 95% CI, 23C31%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermics had abnormal coagulation markers, suggesting a hypercoagulable subphenotype.

While prior studies have demonstrated that MSPE content is variable and selectively positive, no prior work has evaluated the impact of the MSPE on the likelihood to invite (LTI) applicants for a residency interview. This study aimed to evaluate how information in the MSPE impacted LTI, with the hypothesis that changes in LTI would be relatively rare based on MSPE review alone. METHODS We conducted a prospective, observational study analyzing applications to three EM residency programs during the 2019-2020 match cycle. Reviewers assessed applications and rated the LTI on a five-point Likert scale where LTI was defined as follows: 1 = definitely no; 2 = probably no; 3 = unsure; 4 = probably yes; and 5 = definitely yes. The LTI was recorded before and after MSPE review. A change in LTI was considered meaningful when it changed the overall trajectory of the applicant's likelihood to receive an invitation to interview. RESULTS We reviewed a total of 877 applications with the LTI changing 1 point on the Likert scale 160 (18.2%) times. The LTI was meaningfully impacted in a minority of applications - 48 total (5.5 %, p< 0.01) - with only 1 (0.11%) application changing from 1 or 2 (definitely/probably no) to 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes) and 34 (3.8%) changing from 3 (unsure) to 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes). Thirteen (1.5%) applications changed from 4 or 5 (probably/definitely yes) to 3 (unsure or probably/definitely no). CONCLUSION Review of the MSPE resulted in a meaningful change in LTI in only 5.5% of applications. Given the time required for program leadership to review all parts of the variably formatted MSPEs, this finding supports a more efficient application review, where the PD's focus is on succinct and objective aspects of the application, such as the Standardized Letter of Evaluation.","output":"Does the Medical Student Performance Evaluation Change the Decision to Invite Residency Applicants?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 IgG screening of 1,000 antenatal serum samples in the Oxford area, United Kingdom, between 14 April and 15 June 2020, yielded a 5.3% seroprevalence, mirroring contemporaneous regional data.

Reported findings include chest pain, elevated troponin levels, and cardiac MRI abnormalities. ECG abnormalities include ST-elevation but to our knowledge, ventricular arrhythmia has not been yet described. In the vast majority of reported cases, symptoms were relatively mild and patients recovered fully. Method: Here, we report two male adolescents (15 resp. 13 years old) admitted to our hospital with nonsustained (ns) VT and chest pain (patient no. 1) and near syncope (patient no. 2) after receiving an mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (patient no. 1: 4 days after the second dose and patient no. 2: 15 days after days after the first dose). Further workup included family history, standard 12 lead ECG, the Holter monitoring, heart catheterization, myocardial biopsy, invasive programmed RV stimulation, and cardiac MRI. Results: Both patients did not have elevated troponin levels nor specific ECG findings. Family history was free for cardiac diseases, sudden cardiac death, or syncopal episodes. The Holter monitoring showed recurrent ns VT in one patient. Cardiac MRI and myocardial biopsy in both patients did not show evidence of myocarditis, but both patients showed severe thickening of the arterioles in myocardial biopsy. Invasive RV-stimulation did not trigger VT. Ultimately, both patients did not meet diagnostic criteria for myocarditis and -blockers were started for ns VT. As of today, four more patients in age group 12 to 17 years were diagnosed with vaccine-associated myocarditis in our institution and one male with COVID-19 associated myocarditis. Notably, none of these patients had ventricular tachycardia or other cardiac arrhythmia. Conclusion: We observed ventricular tachycardia after SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccination in two adolescent males.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: HealthStreet, the University of Florida community engagement program, sends Community Health Workers (CHWs) where people congregate to assess social determinants of health and medical histories, used to make referrals to services and research opportunities. CHWs conducted follow-up COVID-19 assessments measuring perceived stress, loneliness, depression, anxiety, binge drinking, and opioid use, as well as high blood pressure and food insecurity. Here, we consider mental health outcomes among 1,300 adults who reported being food insecure either at some time in the past 12 months at baseline, or at the COVID-19 follow-up assessment, and completed both. Chi-Square Test was used to determine p-values. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Overall, at the COVID-19 follow-up assessment, 37.1% (of 1,300) were still food insecure during COVID-19 (same), 20.3% (had become food insecure during COVID-19 (worse) and 42.6% were no longer food insecure (better).

In order to assess the risks related to aircraft ground operations, all the influencing variables that can affect the safety of maneuvers should be determined. Generally, catastrophic accidents that occur inside an aerodrome are assigned to the runway incursions and excursions. Incursions are dedicated to all events happening inside the runway (e.g. existence of an obstacle or accident of two aircraft) and excursions are considered for an unsuccessful aircraft operation which leads to surpassing the designated thresholds/borders of the runway. Landing and take-off overruns, as the main excursion events, are responsible for the major recorded incidents/accidents over the past 50 years. Many variables can affect the probability of runway-related accidents such as weather conditions, aircraft braking potential, pilots level of experience, etc. The scope of this study is to determine weather-wise parameters that amplify the probability of excursion events. In order to quantify the probability of each type of accidents, the effect of each meteorological variables on the aircraft operation is simulated by RSARA/LRSARA? simulators, released by Aircraft Cooperative Research Program (ACRP). In this regard, specific airports with diverse characteristics (i.e.; landlocked airport, extreme annual operations, extreme runway geometries and weather conditions) are selected as case studies in the analyses.

Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as \\"coronaphobia\\", has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV2\\", \\"Pandemic\\", \\"Psychology\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Psychitry\\", \\"marginalized\\", \\"telemedicine\\", \\"mental health\\", \\"quarantine\\", \\"infodemic\\", \\"social media\\" and\\" \\"internet\\". Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an \\"infodemic\\" spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. CONCLUSION: For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.","output":"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a group of RNA viruses that cause diseases in vertebrates including. Newer and deadlier than SARS CoV-2 are sought to appear in future for which the scientific community must be prepared with the strategies for their control. Spike protein (S-protein) of all the CoVs require angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), while CoVs also require hemagglutinin-acetylesterase (HE) glycoprotein receptor to simultaneously interact with O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells, both these interactions enable viral particle to enter host cell leading to its infection. Target inhibition of viral S-protein and HE glycoprotein receptor can lead to a development of therapy against the SARS CoV-2. The proposition is to recognize molecules from the bundle of phytochemicals of medicinal plants known to possess antiviral potentials as a lead that could interact and mask the active site of, HE glycoprotein which would ideally bind to O-acetylated sialic acids on human host cells.

However, to date, there is uncertainty regarding the consequences of IRS withdrawal on malaria control when there is no clear exit strategy in place. Therefore, there is need to comprehensively update literature regarding malaria burden indicators when IRS is withdrawn following sustained use. Methods: This protocol follows the PRISMA guidelines. We performed a systematic search of studies published between 2000 and 2022 in CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsychInfo, Scopus and OpenGrey. Using pre-set eligibility criteria, studies will be used to identify the relevant ones by two independent reviewers. Titles and abstracts will first be screened and potentially eligible ones screened using their full-text publications. Any conflicts or discrepancies at the two stages will be resolved through regular discussion sessions. Included studies will be extracted to capture study, patient characteristics and relevant outcomes (malaria incidence and malaria vector abundance). Relevant tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the studies measuring the impact of withdrawal. A meta-analysis will be performed, if sufficient homogeneity exists, otherwise, data arising will be presented using tables and by employing narrative synthesis techniques. Heterogeneity will be assessed using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the chi-square test and I-square statistic results.

We explore the value of cystatin C (CysC) level in the evaluation of disease severity and prognosis in patients with SFTS. METHODS: 254 patients with SFTS were enrolled in this study. According to the classification and the outcome of the disease, the patients were divided into the general group and the severe group, the severe patients were divided into the fatal group and the non-fatal group. We compared the laboratory indexes by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the severity and prognostic risk factors of SFTS disease, ROC curve and KaplanCMeier survival analysis curve were drawn to analyze the independent risk factors and the predictive value of disease severity and prognosis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that the CysC level in severe group and fatal group was significantly higher than general group and non-fatal group (P < 0.05), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the CysC level was an independent risk factor for severe and death in SFTS patients, and it can effectively predict the risk of severe (AUC = 0.711, 95% CI: 0.645C0.777) and death (AUC = 0.814, 95% CI: 0.737C0.89).

Maxillofacial surgery represents an example of a specialty that has had to adapt to this outbreak, because of the subspecialties of oncology and traumatology. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of this outbreak on the specialty of maxillofacial surgery and how the current situation is being managed on a worldwide scale. To achieve this goal, the authors developed an anonymous questionnaire which was posted on the internet and also sent to maxillofacial surgeons around the globe using membership lists from various subspecialty associations. The questionnaire asked for information about the COVID-19 situation in the respondents country and in their workplace, and what changes they were facing in their practices in light of the outbreak. The objective was not only to collect and analyse data, but also to highlight what the specialty is facing and how it is handling the situation, in the hope that this information will be useful as a reference in the future, not only for this specialty, but also for others, should COVID-19 or a similar global threat arise again.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on maxillofacial surgery practice: a worldwide survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary health care is a comprehensive care with a wide range of essential services for people living in the rural and hard-to-reach areas.

METHODS Twelve dissected specimens were used to study the pathway of an acupuncture needle inserted at Jingbi. The stratified anatomy and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus were studied. Our samples were grouped by gender and cause of death for comparative analysis. RESULTS All needles (n = 24, on both sides of a total of 12 cadavers) punctured the anterior scalene muscle medial to the brachial plexus and external jugular vein, lateral to the phrenic nerve and internal jugular vein, and superior to the clavicle and subclavian artery/vein. The depth of needle insertion at Jingbi on the right side of male samples was 28.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 22.5-30.8) mm, which was approximately 8 mm deeper than for female subjects (p < 0.05). The needle was 3.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0) mm and 7.0 (IQR, 5.5-8.0) mm medial to the brachial plexus on the left and right sides, respectively. CONCLUSION Deep needle insertion at Jingbi can puncture the anterior scalene muscle.

We assessed the impact of these changes on match and training injuries in the final 20-weeks of the season following the resumption of competition. DESIGN: The 2019C20 season was compared to the previous three seasons (2016C19). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean incidence, severity and burden of training and match injuries in 2019C20 compared to the 2016C19 period mean. The 2019C20 post-suspension mean match injury rate [77/1000 h (95%CIs: 67C89)] was comparable to the 2019C20 pre-suspension [93/1000 h (95%CIs:85C101)] and significantly lower than the 2016C19 seasons equivalent post-suspension period [97/1000 h (95%CIs: 90C104) IRR 0.8 p = 0.002]. In the 2019C20 season, there was a significantly higher rate of training injury post-suspension in comparison to pre-suspension [3.8/1000 h (95%CIs:3.3C4.4) vs 2.7/1000 h (95%CIs:2.5C3.1) IRR 1.4 p = 0.005].

We characterized participants as essential or non-essential based on self-reported occupation/industry and New York State executive orders issued during the pandemic. We compared job benefits and perceptions of workplace environment between groups. RESULTS: There were 563 participants: 341 essential and 222 non-essential workers. Essential workers less frequently reported access to disability pay through work [n(%): 148 (58) versus 130 (73), pa??< a??0.01]. Essential workers in unions had greater availability of sick leave and disability pay than non-unionized essential workers (86% versus 53%, pa??< a??0.01, and 76% versus 46%, pa??< a??0.01, respectively).

Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (?) and R t. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8?, 1.2) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8?, 1.2) intervention is applied.

Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","output":"Negative attitudes about facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic: The dual importance of perceived ineffectiveness and psychological reactance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) has not gained widespread acceptance because of technical difficulties, especially esophagojejunal anastomosis. Various modified procedures for reconstruction have been reported, but an optimal method has not been established. The authors report a circular-stapled anastomosis using hand-sewn purse-string sutures, which is a simple and classic method. However, no previous study has assessed its reliability. METHODS From September 2008 to May 2009, 10 consecutive patients (9 men and 1 woman) with gastric cancer underwent LTG at the authors' institution. These patients had a median age of 63.7 years (range, 45-80 years) and a body mass index of 22.4 kg/m(2) (range, 18-26 kg/m(2)). After transection of the abdominal esophagus, a hand-sewn purse-string suture along the cut end of the esophagus was performed using 3-0 monofilament thread. An anvil head then was inserted into the esophagus, and the thread was tied. A monofilament pretied loop suture was added to reinforce the ligation. After the creation of an Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, laparoscopic esophagojejunal anastomosis was performed using a circular stapler inserted via a surgical glove attached to a wound retractor at the incision point at the umbilicus. The jejunal stump was closed with an endoscopic linear stapler. RESULTS Laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy was performed successfully for all the patients. No postoperative complications related to anastomosis occurred. In one patient, an intraabdominal abscess developed postoperatively and was treated conservatively. The mean operation time was 257 min, and the estimated blood loss was 69 ml. CONCLUSIONS With the described method, esophagojejunostomy can be performed as in conventional open surgery. Hand-sewn purse-string suturing is demanding technically, but it can be performed safely by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This technique is feasible and can lower the cost of the laparoscopic procedure.

While interventions have been implemented to optimize how this skill is taught in medical school, it remains an area of concern and anxiety for many medical students. To date, a comprehensive assessment of these interventions has not been done. The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature on interventions that aim to improve medical student education on gynecological exams. METHOD The authors searched 6 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, ERIC [Proquest]) from inception to August 4, 2020. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: focus on medical students, intervention with the purpose of teaching students to better perform gynecological exams, and reported outcomes/evaluation. Extracted data included study location, study design, sample size, details of the intervention and evaluation, and context of the pelvic exam. All outcomes were summarized descriptively; key outcomes were coded as subjective or objective assessments. RESULTS The search identified 5,792 studies; 50 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions described were diverse, with many controlled studies evaluating multiple methods of instruction. Gynecological teaching associates (GTAs), or professional patients, were the most common method of education. GTA-led teaching resulted in improvements in student confidence, competence, and communication skills. Physical adjuncts, or anatomic models and simulators, were the second most common category of intervention. Less resource intensive interventions, such as self-directed learning packages, online training modules, and video clips also demonstrated positive results in student comfort and competence.

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. METHODS: We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing and 'shielding' (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. We also present sensitivity analyses for key model parameters subject to uncertainty. RESULTS: We predicted median symptomatic attack rates over the first 12 months of 23% (Niger) to 42% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R0. The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Mitigation strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand and mortality by around 50%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature, and assumptions on transmissibility, infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and risk of severe disease or death by age. CONCLUSIONS: In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding could achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","output":"Response strategies for COVID-19 epidemics in African settings: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background At the present time, COVID-19 vaccines are at the testing stage, and an effective treatment for COVID-19 incorporating appropriate safety measures remains the most significant obstacle to be overcome A strategic countermeasure is, therefore, urgently required Aim This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir-azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir-doxycycline, and azithromycin-hydroxychloroquine used to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections Setting and Design This study was conducted at four different clinical study sites in Indonesia The subjects gave informed consent for their participation and were confirmed as being COVID-19-positive by means of an RT-PCR test The present study constituted a randomized, double-blind, and multicenter clinical study of patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection Materials and Methods Six treatment groups participated in this study: a Control group administered with a 500 mg dose of azithromycin;Group A which received a 200/50 mg dose of lopinavir/ritonavir and 500 mg of azithromycin;Group B treated with a 200/50 mg dose of lopinavir/ritonavir and 200 mg of doxycycline;Group C administered with 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine and 500 mg of azithromycin;Group D which received a 400/100 mg dose of lopinavir/ritonavir and 500 mg of azithromycin;and Group E treated with a 400/100 mg dose of lopinavir/ritonavir and 200 mg of doxycycline Results 754 subjects participated in this study: 694 patients (92 4%) who presented mild symptoms and 57 patients (7 6%) classified as suffering from a moderate case of COVID-19 On the third day after treatment, 91 7%C99 2% of the subjects in Groups ACE were confirmed negative by a PCR swab test compared to 26 9% in the Control group Observation of all groups which experienced a significant decrease in virus load between day 1 and day 7 was undertaken Other markers, such as CRP and IL-6, were significantly lower in all treatment groups (p &lt; 0 05 and p &lt; 0 0001) than in the Control group Furthermore, IL-10 and TNF- levels were significantly elevated in all treatment groups (p &lt; 0 0001) The administration of azithromycin to the Control group increased CRP and IL-6 levels, while reduced IL-10 and TNF- on day 7 (p &lt; 0 0001) compared with day 1 Decreases in ALT and AST levels were observed in all groups (p &lt; 0 0001) There was an increase in creatinine in the serum level of the Control, C, D, and E groups (p &lt; 0 05), whereas the BUN level was elevated in all groups (p &lt; 0 0001) Conclusions The study findings suggest that the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir-doxycycline, lopinavir/ritonavir-azithromycin, and azithromycin-hydroxychloroquine as a dual drug combination produced a significantly rapid PCR conversion rate to negative in three-day treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases Further studies should involve observation of older patients with severe clinical symptoms in order to collate significant amounts of demographic data [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Biochemistry Research International is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Clinical Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of a Drug Combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir-Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir-Doxycycline, and Azithromycin-Hydroxychloroquine for Patients Diagnosed with Mild to Moderate COVID-19 Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has given a halt to all the activities in the world.

Patient Characteristics and Outcome [Image: see text] METHODS: IRB approved retrospective chart review study of all COVID-19 patients admitted during March 2020 focusing on patient characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical manifestations and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients were admitted during March 2020: 57% African American 23.1% Hispanic and 16.9% White. 44.9% female, average age 60 years, and 90% had at least one comorbidity. Outcome was available on all patients except for one who was transferred to another institution for ECMO. Overall mortality was 33%. Clinical presentation: 69.4% presented with cough or shortness of breath, 15.8% with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain, and 14.6% with myalgia, dizziness or altered mental status. 6.2% presented only with fever. However 59.8% of patients presented with fever and respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. MORTALITY: The table compares patients who died vs discharged (either home or to a short term facility). Those that were 65 years or older, hypertensive or presented to the ER with an oxygen saturation of 94% or lower, were more likely to die. Ventilated patients: 31.6% of patients were intubated with a mortality rate of 77%. 22% of these patients were intubated in the first 24 hours. Compared to non-intubated patients, there was no difference in BMI, diabetes, hypertension, COPD/Asthma, use of statins, aspirin or calcium channel blockers. Intubated patients older than 64 years had significantly higher mortality rates (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: This cohort of COVID-19 patients is unique as almost all received Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. Only 9% received steroids and even fewer received an interleukin-6 inhibitor, convalescent plasma or Remdesivir. African Americans and Hispanics accounted for 80% of patients. Greater than 90% received Medicaid. Overall mortality was 33%. The most common presentation was respiratory followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. The overall mortality was 33% but increased to 77% in intubated patients. Age, hypertension, and ER oxygen saturation correlated with mortality.

Several MMTV strains have been shown to productively infect, in addition to murine cells, various heterologous cell lines including those of human origin, albeit less efficiently than murine cells. Furthermore, there have been reports that the continued passage of MMTV in heterologous cell lines gives rise to novel variants that are able to infect naive non-murine cells with higher efficiency than the parental virus. RESULTS: We show that MMTV(C3H), like other MMTV strains, that had undergone a number of replication cycles in non-murine cells displayed an increased replication kinetic, as compared to parental virus, when applied on naive human cells. Sequence analysis of several replication kinetic variants and the parental virus, together with calculation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations at individual codons, revealed that several regions within the viral genome were under strong positive selection pressure during viral replication in human cells. The mutation responsible, at least in part, for the phenotypic change was subsequently mapped to the segment of env encoding the receptor binding site (F(40)HGFR(44)). Introduction of the identified mutation, leading to single amino acid substitution (G42E), into egfp-containing recombinant MMTV virions enhanced their ability to bind to and infect human cells. Interestingly, neither the replication kinetic mutant nor the parental virus required human TfR1 for infection. Knock-out of TFR1 gene from the human genome did not decrease the susceptibility of Hs578T cells to virus infection. Furthermore, the expression of human TfR1, in contrast to mouse TfR1, did not enhance the susceptibility of MMTV-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, human TfR1 is dispensable for infection and another cell surface molecule mediates the MMTV entry into human cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data explain the mechanism enabling MMTV to form host-range variants in non-murine cells that has been known for a long time, the basis of which remained obscure. Our findings may expand our understanding of how viruses gain capability to cross species-specific barriers to infect new hosts.

To uncover new antiviral therapies, we developed a live cell-based high content screening approach for rapid identification of RSV inhibitors and characterized five drug classes which inhibit the virus. Among the molecular targets for each hit, there was a strong functional enrichment in lipid metabolic pathways. Modulation of lipid metabolites by statins, a key hit from our screen, decreases the production of infectious virus through a combination of cholesterol and isoprenoid-mediated effects. Notably, RSV infection globally upregulates host protein prenylation, including the prenylation of Rho GTPases. Treatment by statins or perillyl alcohol, a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor, reduces infection in vitro. Of the Rho GTPases assayed in our study, a loss in Rac1 activity strongly inhibits the virus through a decrease in F protein surface expression. Our findings provide new insight into the importance of host lipid metabolism to RSV infection and highlight geranylgeranyltransferases as an antiviral target for therapeutic development.","output":"Statin-mediated disruption of Rho GTPase prenylation and activity inhibits respiratory syncytial virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both qualitative and quantitative platelet abnormalities are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and they correlate with clinical severity and mortality.

While a number of syndromic surveillance systems are being evaluated in the US, very few have had success thus far in predicting an infectious disease event. Furthermore, to date, the majority of syndromic surveillance systems have been based primarily in emergency department settings, with varying levels of enhancement from other data sources. While research has been done on the value of telephone helplines on health care use and patient satisfaction, very few projects have looked at using a telephone helpline as a source of data for syndromic surveillance, and none have been attempted in Canada. The notable exception to this statement has been in the UK where research using the national NHS Direct system as a syndromic surveillance tool has been conducted. METHODS/DESIGN: The purpose of our proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Ontario's telephone nursing helpline system as a real-time syndromic surveillance system, and how its implementation, if successful, would have an impact on outbreak event detection in Ontario. Using data collected retrospectively, all \\"reasons for call\\" and assigned algorithms will be linked to a syndrome category. Using different analytic methods, normal thresholds for the different syndromes will be ascertained. This will allow for the evaluation of the system's sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. The next step will include the prospective monitoring of syndromic activity, both temporally and spatially. DISCUSSION: As this is a study protocol, there are currently no results to report. However, this study has been granted ethical approval, and is now being implemented. It is our hope that this syndromic surveillance system will display high sensitivity and specificity in detecting true outbreaks within Ontario, before they are detected by conventional surveillance systems.

The reports indicate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to affect almost any organ due to the presence of a receptor known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) across the body. ACE2 receptor is majorly expressed in the brush border of gut enterocytes along with the ciliated cells and alveolar epithelial type II cells in the lungs. The amino acid transport function of ACE2 has been linked to gut microbial ecology in gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thereby suggesting that COVID-19 may, to some level, be linked to the enteric microbiota.

Herein we sought to quantify the extent of tissue catabolism in similar patients. STUDY DESIGN: During acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) in COVID-AKI patients we measured urea Kt/V adequacy and calculated daily urea nitrogen generation rate while quantifying their daily protein intake. SETTING AND POPULATION: We did calculations in 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD at the Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC. As a comparator we obtained urea kinetic parameters from our database of ambulatory patients on maintenance PD. EXPOSURE OR PREDICTORS: 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD. OUTCOMES: Urea nitrogen generation rate in relation to daily protein intake ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Urea nitrogen generation rate from urea kinetics was related to measured daily dietary protein intake in these patients and compared it to this relationship in ambulatory maintenance PD patients where both parameters were calculated from urea kinetics. RESULTS: Urea nitrogen generation rate in AKI patients was 10.2 + 5g/day, which is >2 fold higher than stable outpatients on maintenance PD (4.7 + 3g/day), despite similar dietary protein intake (74.8 + 11g/day vs 67.2 + 29g/day, respectively). This strongly suggests endogenous protein breakdown, probably from muscle. Urea nitrogen generation rate in these AKI patients corresponds to 315g/day of ongoing muscle breakdown and cumulative 2.5kg muscle breakdown during the early course of AKI. LIMITATIONS: Small number of participants as well as assumptions in comparing Urea nitrogen generation rate with protein intake CONCLUSIONS: In highly catabolic patients, an endogenous source of urea generation, such as muscle protein breakdown, seems to be the most likely explainable cause for our findings.

The SARS-CoV-2 non-spike structural proteins of nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) are critical in the host cell interferon response and memory T-cell immunity and have been grossly overlooked in the development of COVID vaccines. Objective. To determine the safety and immunogenicity of UB-612, a multitope vaccine containing S1-RBD-sFc protein and rationally-designed promiscuous peptides representing sequence-conserved Th and CTL epitopes on the Sarbecovirus nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and spike (S2) proteins. Design, setting and participants. UB-612 booster vaccination was conducted in Taiwan. A UB-612 booster dose was administered 6-8 months post-2nd dose in 1,478 vaccinees from 3,844 healthy participants (aged 18-85 years) who completed a prior placebo (saline)-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, multi-center Phase-2 primary 2-dose series (100-ug per dose; 28-day apart) of UB-612. The interim safety and immunogenicity were evaluated until 14 days post-booster. Exposure. Vaccination with a booster 3rd-dose (100-ug) of UB-612 vaccine. Main outcomes and measures. Solicited local and systemic AEs were recorded for seven days in the e-diaries of study participants, while skin allergic reactions were recorded for fourteen days. The primary immunogenicity endpoints included viral-neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT, Wuhan strain) and live Delta variant (VNT50), and against pseudovirus WT and Omicron variant (pVNT50). The secondary immunogenicity endpoints included anti-S1-RBD IgG antibody, S1-RBD:ACE2 binding inhibition, and T-cell responses by ELISpot and Intracellular Staining. Results. No post-booster vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain and fatigue, mostly mild and transient. The UB-612 booster prompted a striking upsurge of neutralizing antibodies against live WT Wuhan strain (VNT50, 1,711) associated with unusually high cross-neutralization against Delta variant (VNT50, 1,282); and similarly with a strong effect against pseudovirus WT (pVNT50, 6,245) and Omicron variant (pVNT50, 1,196). Upon boosting, the lower VNT50 and pVNT50 titers of the elderly in the primary series were uplifted to the same levels as those of the young adults. The UB-612 also induced robust, durable VoC antigen-specific Th1-oriented (IFN-{gamma}+-) responses along with CD8+ T-cell (CD107a+-Granzyme B+) cytotoxicity. Conclusions and relevance. With a pronounced cross-reactive booster effect on B- and T-cell immunity, UB-612 may serve as a universal vaccine booster for comprehensive immunity enhancement against emergent VoCs.

We draw on the hindranceCchallenge framework to suggest that role overload contains both hindrance and challenge stressor components. We integrate this theory with the behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation systems (BIS and BAS) perspective to develop hypotheses about the effects of role overload on employees extra-role performance (voice). We suggest that although role overload is positively associated with withdrawal (a prototypical response of the BIS system) and ultimately negatively influences extra-role performance, it can also trigger job crafting (a prototypical response of the BAS system) and is, consequently, positively associated with extra-role performance. We further posit that the strength of these indirect effects is moderated by the quality of leaderCmember exchange (LMX). To support these hypotheses, we conducted a time-lagged study of 450 full-time pre-school teachers from various Chinese kindergartens. As hypothesized, we found that withdrawal and job crafting mediated the relationship between role overload and extra-role performance. Further, LMX strengthens the positive relationship between role overload and job crafting. Taken together, our results suggest that role overload can be a mixed stressor that activates both negative and positive behaviors, thus ultimately having an impact on extra-role performance.","output":"The Mixed Effect of Role Overload on Extra-Role Performance: The Mediation Role of Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease and drives the pandemic but the interplay of droplet and aerosol physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimisation strategies, we studied cough-driven material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies. DESIGN: Computer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multiphysics and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers. SETTING: Hospital setting during a respiratory virus pandemic with transmission by respiratory droplets and aerosols. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy volunteers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of, and exposure to, potentially infectious respiratory secretions. RESULTS: Respiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short-distance ballistic, jet rider and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, jet rider droplets travelled with the turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. Cough shields captured large droplets but induced lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A Shield and Sink approach combining cough shields with virus sinks minimised exposure to all secretions in modelling and real-life experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Jet riders have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in COVID-19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimised through an easily implemented Shield and Sink strategy.","output":"Minimising exposure to respiratory droplets, jet riders and aerosols in air-conditioned hospital rooms by a Shield-and-Sink strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study sought to obtain feedback from stakeholder cancer caregivers and bereaved family members on the implementation of bereavement risk screening in oncology.

An efficient service is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic as a significant proportion of rheumatology patients are shielding because of immunosuppression and their underlying chronic rheumatological conditions. The pandemic resulted in several drastic changes to the rheumatology department at United Lincolnshire Hospital Trust (ULHT), such re-deployment of staff to the frontline. We performed a local audit to assess patient satisfaction and fulfilment of expectations with the helpline during the lockdown and identify areas of improvement to provide an effective helpline service. Methods Patients accessed the helpline by leaving a message over the phone and fifty patients were selected using random sampling. We designed a questionnaire in adherence to RCN guideline. After their query was resolved and obtaining their consent, we assessed their experience by calling them. We analysed the subject of the query and the outcome of the call retrospectively. We aimed to determine if they were psychologically supported, satisfied with the response time and overall, how the query was resolved. We explored their feedback and alternative choices had the helpline not been available. Results A significant proportion (40%) of queries were regarding worsening symptoms of rheumatological conditions. Some of these queries were in context of COVID-19. 35% of the queries were medications related. 94% of the calls were attended within 48 hours. Of 50 patients, 88% (44/50) were satisfied with the response time, 82% (41/50) were satisfied with the overall service, and 88% (44/50) felt they were psychologically supported. 94% (47/50) of the respondents have said that they will call the helpline again if required. Had the helpline not been available, 64% (32/50) patients would have visited their GP and 10% (5/50) would have attended A&E. Nearly 29% of the outcome of the queries were verbal advice alone without further consultations. Other major outcomes were appointment with doctors and prescription renewals. Patient feedback allowed us to identify issues involving communication between patients, GPs and the rheumatology department. Conclusion The helpline continued to be highly appreciated by the patients. It plays a crucial role in alleviating patients medical and psychological concerns and maintaining continuity of care. During the pandemic, there is an increased necessity to access an effective helpline. Several important changes were made to streamline the information on the trusts rheumatology web page. We also amended the voice message to better triage patients. A rheumatology helpline template was added for record keeping through the digital dictation system. This will allow the department to communicate with GPs within 48 hours of response; to alert them regarding changes in medications or other management recommendations. Disclosure A.T.

To test this hypothesis, S100A9-/- and wild-type (WT; S100A9+/+) C57BL/6 mice were compared using a model of ligature-induced periodontitis.

A lack of effective methods for screening potential patients, rapidly diagnosing suspected cases, and accurately monitoring of the epidemic in real time to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 raises significant difficulties in mitigating the epidemic in many countries. As effective point-of-care diagnosis tools, simple, low-cost and rapid sensors have the potential to greatly accelerate the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients to improve their treatment and care. In particular, there is evidence that multiple pathogens have been detected in sewage, including SARS-CoV-2, providing significant opportunities for the development of advanced sensors for wastewater-based epidemiology that provide an early warning of the pandemic within the population. Sensors could be used to screen potential carriers, provide real-time monitoring and control of the epidemic, and even support targeted drug screening and delivery within the integration of emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology.

Methods Our pilot, observational study included 15 patients (30 eyes) with severe POAG. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, number of anti-glaucoma drugs, visual fields, and SPARCS score were recorded at first visit and at 12 and 24 months. Results We observed changes in mean deviation (MD) from -19.37  5.04 to -20.63  4.07, mean pattern standard deviation (PSD) from 11.49  2.61 to 11.35  2.01, and mean SPARCS score from 54.97  15.66 to 53.50  16.42. We found no statistically significant difference between visual field parameters and SPARCS scores associated with the number or type of prescribed anti-glaucoma drugs. Spearman's correlation coefficient of SPARCS at baseline (SPARCS1) versus MD at baseline (MD1) was 0.274 (p = 0.142) and SPARCS1 versus PSD at baseline (PSD1) was -0.163 (p = 0.389). The correlation coefficient between SPARCS at 12 months (SPARCS2) versus MD (MD2) at the same time point was computed to be 0.391 (p = 0.03), whereas SPARCS2 versus PSD at 12 months was -0.212 (p = 0.262). Similarly, we found the coefficient to be 0.336 (p = 0.069) for SPARCS3 (SPARCS at 24 months) versus MD3 (MD at 24 months) and -0.242 (p = 0.197) for SPARCS3 versus PSD3 (PSD at 24 months). Correlation coefficients between SPARCS1/2, SPARCS1/3, MD1/2, MD1/3 PSD1/2, and PSD1/3 were 0.856, 0.865, 0.748, 0.722, 0.497, and 0.562, respectively (p < 0.001).

Many different types of the virus exist, but only a few types are used as attenuated live vaccines in the commercial poultry industry. Of the vaccine types used, the Arkansas (Ark)-type virus is most frequently reisolated from vaccinated broilers. Previous research has suggested that incomplete clearance of Ark-type vaccine virus plays a role in the inadequate protection observed when vaccinated broilers are challenged with pathogenic Ark virus. In this study, we examine routes of vaccine administration using multiple IBV types including Ark in an effort to understand why Ark vaccines do not provide good protection and persist in commercial broilers. We found that interference between different types of IBV vaccines was not occurring when combined and administered using a commercial hatchery spray cabinet. Also, Ark vaccine virus was not efficacious in 1-day-old broilers when sprayed using a hatchery spray cabinet, but it gave good protection when administrated by eyedrop inoculation. We also found that the amount of Ark vaccine virus was low or undetectable in choanal swabs out to 35 days postvaccination when vaccine was administered by eyedrop or drinking water. Alternatively, a subpopulation of the Ark vaccine isolated from a vaccinated bird, Ark-RI-EP1, showed a peak titer at 7-10 days of age when given by the same routes, suggesting that the Ark-RI-EP1 was more fit with regard to infection, replication in the birds, or both. Moreover, we found that detection of IBV vaccine virus early after administration, regardless of strain or route, correlated with protection against homologous challenge and may thus be a good indicator of vaccine efficacy in the field because humoral antibody titers are typically low or undetectable after vaccination. These experiments provided key findings that can be used to direct efforts for improving the efficacy of IBV Ark-type vaccines given in the hatchery. They also elucidated factors contributing to the persistence of Ark vaccine in the field.","output":"Evaluation of infectious bronchitis virus Arkansas-type vaccine failure in commercial broilers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence for the effectiveness of vitiligo treatments is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine effectiveness of (a) hand-held narrowband-UVB (NB-UVB) and (b) combination of potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and NB-UVB compared to TCS, for localised vitiligo. METHODS: Pragmatic, 3-arm, placebo-controlled RCT (9 months' treatment; 12 months' follow-up). Adults and children, recruited from secondary care and community, aged &#8805;5 years with active vitiligo affecting <10% of skin, were randomised 1:1:1 to receive: TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment + dummy NB-UVB); NB-UVB (NB-UVB + placebo TCS); or combination (TCS + NB-UVB). TCS applied once daily on alternating weeks; NB-UVB administered alternate days in escalating doses, adjusted for erythema. PRIMARY OUTCOME: treatment success at 9 months at target patch assessed using participant-reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale, with multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS: 517 participants were randomised: TCS (n=173), NB-UVB (n = 169), combination (n=175). Primary outcome data were available for 370 (72%) participants. Target patch treatment success was 17% (TCS), 22% (NB-UVB) and 27% (combination). Combination treatment was superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 10.9% (95% CI 1.0% to 20.9%; p= 0.032; NNT=10). NB-UVB alone was not superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 5.2% (95% CI -4.4% to 14.9%; p= 0.290; NNT=19). Participants using interventions >75% expected were more likely to achieve treatment success, but effects were lost once treatment stopped. Localised grade 3 or 4 erythema was reported in 62 (12%) participants (including 3 with dummy light). Skin thinning was reported in 13 (2.5%) participants (including 1 with placebo ointment). CONCLUSION: Combination treatment with home-based hand-held NB-UVB plus TCS is likely to be superior to TCS alone for treatment of localised vitiligo. Combination treatment was relatively safe and well tolerated but was only successful in around a quarter of participants.","output":"Randomised controlled trial of topical corticosteroid and home-based narrowband UVB for active and limited vitiligo - results of the HI-Light Vitiligo trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has unfortunately halted lab work, conferences, and in-person networking, which is especially detrimental to researchers just starting their labs Through social media and our reviewer networks, we met some early-career stem cell investigators impacted by the closures Here, they introduce themselves and their research to our readers","output":"Introductions to the Community: Early-Career Researchers in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the publication of many scientific papers The goal of the present research was to analyze these papers using the Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) Statistics for 100 publications with high AAS scores were selected and exported from the Dimension database on May 22nd 2020 The major findings were that these publications were published in 34 different journals or preprint repositories More than one-third of the total of 657, 350 social media posts were collected from the Twitter platform The top contributing countries were China, followed by the USA The paper The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2 by Andersen, Kristian G , etal , 2020 had the highest AAS (33 514) These findings may help others to design studies of the AAS in Coronavirus literature and compare them with traditional citations ? 2020 All Rights Reserved","output":"Analysis of the Altmetric top 100 Altmetric Attention Score Coronavirus publications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) outbreak has had a substantial impact on many aspects of general life.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is the key receptor on lung epithelial cells to facilitate initial binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2. The binding to ACE2 is mediated via the spike glycoprotein present on the virus surface. Recent clinical data have demonstrated that patients suffering from stroke are particularly susceptible to severe courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus forming a defined risk group. However, a mechanistic explanation for this finding is lacking. Sterile tissue injuries including stroke induce lymphocytopenia and systemic inflammation that might modulate the expression levels of surface proteins in distant organs. Whether systemic inflammation following stroke can specifically modulate ACE2 expression in the lung has not been investigated. Methods Mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min and sacrificed after 24 h and 72 h for analysis of brain and lung tissues. Gene expression and protein levels of ACE2, ACE, IL-6 and IL1 were measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Immune cell populations in lymphoid organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results Strikingly, 24 h after stroke, we observed a substantial increase in the expression of ACE2 both on the transcriptional and protein levels in the lungs of MCAO mice compared to sham-operated mice. This increased expression persisted until day 3 after stroke. In addition, MCAO increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 in the lungs. Higher gene expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 was found in ischemic brain hemispheres and a reduced number of T-lymphocytes were present in the blood and spleen as an indicator of sterile tissue injury-induced immunosuppression. Conclusions We demonstrate significantly augmented ACE2 levels and inflammation in murine lungs after experimental stroke. These pre-clinical findings might explain the clinical observation that patients with pre-existing stroke represent a high-risk group for the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our studies call for further investigations into the underlying signaling mechanisms and possible therapeutic interventions.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease infected by enveloped single-stranded RNA coronavirus. Meanwhile, DM is a common comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus can directly or indirectly damage the pancreatic islets and cause stress hyperglycemia by causing cytokine storms, acute inflammatory reactions, binding to the ACE2 receptor, etc. At the same time, hyperglycemia is a risk factor for severe infection and an independent risk factor for mild to severe disease. However, there is no evidence-based medicine to confirm the relationship between hyperglycemia and the infection of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing clinical evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will retrieve each database from December 2019 to July 2020.

Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via the mucosal route, a therapy administered by this same route may represent a desirable approach to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is now widely accepted that genetically modified microorganisms, including probiotics, represent attractive vehicles for oral or nasal mucosal delivery of therapeutic molecules. Previous studies have shown that the mucosal administration of therapeutic molecules is able to induce an immune response mediated by specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies along with mucosal cell-mediated immune responses, which effectively concur to neutralize and eradicate infections. Therefore, advances in the modulation of mucosal immune responses, and in particular the use of probiotics as live delivery vectors, may encourage prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of genetically modified probiotics for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging trends in the ever-progressing field of vaccine development re-emphasize the contribution of adjuvants, along with optimization of codon usage (when designing a synthetic gene), expression level, and inoculation dose to elicit specific and potent protective immune responses. In this review, we will highlight the existing pre-clinical and clinical information on the use of genetically modified microorganisms in control strategies against respiratory and non-respiratory viruses.

In this article, we present our current strategy for patient selection, preoperative planning, and a series of intraoperative clues that may help to perform a supermicrosurgical LVA. Technical considerations are presented using a systematic step-by-step method to make this procedure more reproducible and straightforward. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a review of patients operated between January 2015 and June 2018 using the aforementioned approach. Data were collected prospectively, and all procedures were performed by the senior author. Preoperative assessment included lymphoscintigraphy, indocyanine green lymphography, noncontrast magnetic resonance lymphography and high-frequency ultrasonography. Lymphovenous anastomosis was decomposed into a sequential 6-step approach considering the main aspects that determine a successful anastomosis. RESULTS Lymphovenous anastomosis was performed in 229 patients, including 677 anastomoses. Median follow-up was 33 months (range, 13-51 months). A median of 3.1 (range, 1-7) LVA were performed on 2.7 (range, 1-6) incision sites per patient. Median time for dissection of lymphatic(s) and vein(s) was 8.7 minutes (1-18 minutes) with a median time of 27.2 minutes (range, 13-51 minutes) for a complete LVA. Lymphatic detection rate was 100% (677 of 677) and vein detection rate was 99.7% (675 of 677), with 31.0% (210 of 677) of reflux-free veins. For upper-extremity lymphedema (47 of 229; 20.6%), volume reduction was achieved in 100% (47 of 47) of the cases, with a median volume reduction rate of 67% (range, 7-93%). In lower-extremity lymphedema (182 of 229; 79.4%), volume reduction was achieved in 86.8% (158 of 182) of the cases, with a median volume reduction rate of 41% (range, 7-81%). Cellulitis episodes decreased from 2.1 to 0.2 episodes/year after LVA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Acceptable success rates were obtained using a sequential strategy for planning and execution of supermicrosurgical LVA for secondary extremity lymphedema.

In the setting of virtual interviews for residency in 2020, the online availability of program information is of heightened importance. We sought to assess how academic versus community-based general surgery residency programs compared with respect to certain details on their websites. METHODS A total of n = 268 surgery residency programs were investigated. Our database of website characteristics included: direct link to residency website from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program page, resident research requirement, listing of residents' publications, availability of residents' demographic information, program alumni information, board pass rates, attrition rate, detail of educational/academic activities, residents' evaluation methods, diversity, and mentorship. Inter-group analyses between academic and community-based programs were performed using Pearson's Chi-squared test. RESULTS Academic and community-based general surgery residency program websites were compared based on twelve (12) different parameters. Statistically significant differences were observed for eight of these comparisons: direct website access from ACGME (p = 0.007), research highlighted (p < 0.001), resident research requirement (p = 0.002), resident demographic information available (p=0.004), alumni information (p = 0.005), resident evaluation methods (p = 0.016), diversity (p < 0.001), and mentorship (p = 0.012). Across these domains, academic programs had more information available on their websites than the community programs did. The program websites did not differ significantly based on the frequency of mentioning resident publications, board pass rate, attrition rate, or resident education. CONCLUSION Many general surgery programs are lacking detailed information on their websites. The amount of website information available on general surgery residency programs differs when comparing academic and community-based programs.","output":"Love at First Click: Surgery Residency Websites in the Virtual Era."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) but there is little guidance on pharmacotherapy for these symptoms. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the available evidence for pharmacotherapy of comorbid anxiety symptoms in BD. METHODS Completed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications for BD published prior to December 2020 were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ISRCTN. Data from RCTs measuring anxiety symptoms at baseline and endpoint and all-cause discontinuation were pooled to compare efficacy and acceptability of medications with control conditions. RESULTS Thirty-seven RCTs met our inclusion criteria; thirteen placebo-controlled RCTs with 2175 participants had sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis assessing anxiety symptoms. Compared to placebo, the overall effect size of medications (primarily atypical antipsychotics) on anxiety symptoms was small with a standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.22 (95% CI: -0.34 to -0.11). Study heterogeneity was low (I2 = 26%). The acceptability of these medications was comparable to placebo with Odds Ratio of discontinuation from all causes = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91 to 1.06). CONCLUSION There is limited evidence for a small anxiolytic effect and good acceptability of pharmacotherapy (primarily atypical antipsychotics) in the treatment of comorbid anxiety symptoms in BD. These results highlight the need for further research on medications other than atypical antipsychotics.","output":"Efficacy and acceptability of pharmacotherapy for comorbid anxiety symptoms in bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a wide-ranging debate about the merits and demerits of searching for, and sending messages to, extrater- restrial intelligences (SETI and METI).

Despite this, their aetiology remains incompletely understood. Lactogenic hormones, namely, human placental lactogen (hPL) and prolactin (PRL), play often overlooked roles in maternal metabolism and glucose homeostasis during pregnancy and (in the case of PRL) postpartum, and have clinical potential from a diagnostic and therapeutic perspective. This paper presents a protocol for a systematic review which will synthesise the available scientific evidence linking these two hormones to maternal and fetal metabolic conditions/outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE (via OVID), CINAHL and Embase will be systematically searched for all original observational and interventional research articles, published prior to 8 July 2021, linking hPL and/or PRL levels (in pregnancy and/or up to 12 months postpartum) to key maternal metabolic conditions/outcomes (including pre-existing and gestational diabetes, markers of glucose/insulin metabolism, postpartum glucose status, weight change, obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome). Relevant fetal outcomes (birth weight and placental mass, macrosomia and growth restriction) will also be included. Two reviewers will assess articles for eligibility according to prespecified selection criteria, followed by full-text review, quality appraisal and data extraction. Where possible, meta-analysis will be performed; otherwise, a narrative synthesis of findings will be presented.

While relatively underexplored as a research tool, 1 study reported similar response rates to addressed survey mailings with lower cost and potentially lower demographic bias. To evaluate the utility of EDDM as a tool for recruiting a representative sample of rural households in Appalachia Ohio. As part of a larger effort to evaluate community resource utilization in relation to diet, health and food security, a study recruitment postcard was sent via EDDM to all residential addresses (n = 31,201) within an 18 zip code region in Southeastern OH in June 2020. Adult residents were invited to complete a survey online via QR code or short link or to call for a mailed survey. Respondent demographic characteristics were generated using SPSS and compared with the region's 2019 U.S. Census Bureau statistics. A total of 724 households completed the survey, reflecting a response rate lower than estimates for addressed mailings (2.3% vs 6%). Compared to census data, a greater proportion of respondents were female (68% vs 51%), and highly educated (60% vs 36% college graduates);a smaller proportion were non-Hispanic (90% vs 98%), White (88% vs 92%), had 1 child in the household (23% vs 28%), and a household income &lt;$50k (42% vs 54%).

In this observational study, we investigated tocilizumabs role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the management of these patients. METHODS: Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were prospectively observed from February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Data on demographics, medical history, and clinical outcomes were collected. Tocilizumab (TCZ) 4 mg/kg/day q12h was given for 24 hours, followed by methylprednisolone 60 mg q8h for 72 hours to patients with oxygen requirement of 3 L and above. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers were monitored on days: 0, 3, and 6 following the initiation of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with significance () less than or equal to 0.05 (P  0.05). RESULTS: A total of eighty patients (45 males, 56.96%) and (34 females, 43.04%) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were included in this study. The median age was 63 (51 - 72) years. Seven patients expired (8.75%), and nine patients required mechanical ventilation (11.25%). The median of IL-6 levels before administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25 C 666.25) pg/mL compared to after administration of TCZ on day 3, 563 (162-783) pg/mL (P < 0.00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50 - 678.50) pg/mL as compared to day 3 (P = 0.709). Moreover, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimers levels were reduced following the administration of TCZ. TABLE 1: IL-6 of SARS-CoV-2 patients at before and after Tocilizumab treatment [Image: see text] TABLE 2: Laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients at before and after Tocilizumab treatment [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels, which may be useful inflammatory indices in the management of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Furthermore, the sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. The use of IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool and in the management of acutely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"682.

Do investors sacrifice return for pursuing ESG-aligned megatrend goals? The study analyses the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG-themed megatrend investment strategies in global equity markets. The analysis covers nine themes for the period 2015C2019: environmental megatrends covering energy efficiency, food security, and water scarcity; social megatrends covering ageing, millennials, and urbanisation; governance megatrends covered by cybersecurity, disruptive technologies, and robotics. We construct megatrend factor portfolios based on signalling theory and formulate a novel measure for stock megatrend exposure (MTE), based on the relative fund flows into the corresponding thematic ETFs. We apply pure factor portfolios methodology based on constrained WLS cross-sectional regressions to calculate Fama-French factor returns. Time-series regression rests on the generalised method of moments estimator (GMM) that uses robust distance instruments. Our findings show that each environmental megatrend, as well as the disruptive technologies megatrend, yielded positive and significant alphas relative to the passive strategy, although this outperformance becomes statistically insignificant in the Fama-French 5-factor model context. The important result is that most of the megatrend factor portfolios yielded significant non-negative alphas; which supports our assumption that megatrend investing strategy promotes SDGs while not sacrificing returns, even when accounting for transaction costs up to 50bps/annum. Higher transaction costs, as is the case for some of these ETFs with expense ratios reaching 80-100bps, may be an indication of two things: ESG-themed megatrend investors were willing to sacrifice ca. 30-50bps of annual return to remain aligned with sustainability targets, or that expense ratio may well decline in the future.","output":"Performance measurement of ESG-themed megatrend investments in global equity markets using pure factor portfolios methodology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution exposure is a leading public health problem in China. The majority of the total air pollution disease burden is from fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) exposure, with smaller contributions from ozone (O(3)) exposure.

However, levels of exposure and the associated risk remain high, some pollutant emissions have increased, and some sectors lack effective emission control measures. We quantified the potential impacts of relevant policy scenarios on ambient air quality and public health across China. We show that PM(2.5) exposure inside the Greater Bay Area (GBA) is strongly controlled by emissions outside the GBA. We find that reductions in residential solid fuel use and agricultural fertilizer emissions result in the greatest reductions in PM(2.5) exposure and the largest health benefits. A 50% transition from residential solid fuel use to liquefied petroleum gas outside the GBA reduced PM(2.5) exposure by 15% in China and 3% within the GBA, and avoided 191,400 premature deaths each year across China. Reducing agricultural fertilizer emissions of ammonia by 30% outside the GBA reduced PM(2.5) exposure by 4% in China and 3% in the GBA, avoiding 56,500 annual premature deaths across China.

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the generation of donor specific antibodies (DSA) after allogeneic MSC (allo-MSC) therapy and the impact on safety or tolerability. Data from 555 patients were included in the systematic review, 356 were treated with allo-MSC and the rest were treated with placebo or control drugs. A mean of 11.51% of allo-MSC-treated patients developed DSA. Specifically, 14.95% of these patients developed DSA and 6.33% of them developed cPRA. Neither the production of DSA after treatment nor the presence of DSA at baseline (presensitization) were correlated with safety and/or tolerability of the treatment. The number of doses administrated and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches between donor and recipient did not affect the production of DSA. The safety of allo-MSC therapy has been proved in all the studies and the generation of alloantibodies might not have clinical relevance. However, there are very few studies in the area. More studies with adequate designs are needed to confirm these results.","output":"Alloreactive Immune Response Associated to Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Treatment: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed all aspects of everyones life, the closure of schools was one of the most impactful, significantly altering daily life for school personnel, students, and families The shift to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) presented particular challenges to special educators of students with significant support needs who often benefit from strong interpersonal connections, modeling, and the use of physical manipulatives This paper details the experiences of two elementary special education teachers as they navigated the transition to ERT The teachers reported three distinct stages of ERT: making contact, establishing routines, and transitioning to academics They also discussed the challenges they faced during this period, such as the inequity in resources amongst their students, needing to rely on at-home support in order to meaningfully teach students, and changes in what it meant to be a teacher while having to teach online While clearly not in favor of online learning, the teachers do present glimmers of hope, for example, with regards to increased communication between teachers and parents The challenges and strategies used to overcome these challenges will be of use to educators in the coming months, with implications for distance learning in this population ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Am I Doing Enough?

We show that Z-prone sequences (called flipons [2]) exist in coronavirus and provide a signature (Z-sig) that enables identification of the animal viruses from which the human pathogens arose. We also identify a potential RIP Homology Interaction Motif (RHIM) in the helicase Nsp13 that resembles those present in proteins that initiate Z-RNA-dependent cell death through interactions with the Z-RNA sensor protein ZBP1. These two observations allow us to suggest a model in which Nsp13 down regulates Z-RNA activated innate immunity by two distinct mechanisms. The first involves a novel ATP-independent Z-flipon helicase (flipase) activity in Nsp13 that differs from that of canonical A-RNA helicases. This flipase prevents formation of Z-RNAs that would otherwise activate cell death pathways. The second mechanism likely inhibits the interactions between ZBP1 and the Receptor Interacting Proteins Kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 by targeting their RHIM domains. Together the described Nsp13 RHIM and flipase activities have the potential to alter the host response to coronaviruses and impact the design of drugs targeting the Nsp13 protein. The Z-sig and RHIM domains may provide a way of identifying previously uncharacterized viruses that are potentially pathogenic for humans.","output":"Z-RNA and the flipside of the SARS Nsp13 helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the coronavirus pandemic and the Omicron variant once again forcing countries into lockdown (as of late 2021), this essay seeks to outline a Foucauldian critique of various legal measures taken by the Danish government to cope with COVID-19 during the first year and a half of the pandemic. The essay takes a critical look at the extra-legal measures employed by the Danish government, as the Danish politicians attempted to halt the spread of the, now almost forgotten, Cluster 5 COVID-19 variant. This situation will serve as a critical point from where to start using Foucaults writings on life and biopolitics in order to expose various legally problematic governmental decisions that became visible during the handling of COVID-19 in general and the Cluster 5 mutation in particular. Reframing the pandemic within Foucaults concept of biopolitics, this essay concludes that the state of exception has led to an increase in biopolitical logic, where some lives have come to matter more than others. As a critical counterpoint to this logic, the conclusion suggests that the notion of biocommunism could provide a suitable reconfiguration of communism. A reconfiguration that could mitigate some of issues related to biopolitics is uncovered earlier in the essay. ? 2022 by the author.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Studies were identified through a systematic search of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar (through January 2020) and manual handsearching of relevant articles. Observational studies reporting adherence to AHT drugs measured by self-report or pharmacy refill prescription-based methods among men and women were included. Summarised estimates of ORs with 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects model and meta-regression models. RESULTS From 12 849 potentially relevant publications, 82 studies (15 517 457 men and 18 537 599 women) were included. No significant between-sex differences in adherence to AHT were observed, whether all study-specific estimates were summarised (ORs 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p=0.07), nor estimates were pooled according to the method for measuring adherence. Among patients aged 65 years or older, lower self-reported adherence was observed in women (ORs 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97, p=0.02), while the main result remained unchanged according to other subgroup analyses.

The subjects were 17 males and 14 females aged 5 to 14 years (mean age, 9.1 years). Maxillary sinus aspirates were collected and cultured, with subsequent viral and bacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Bacteria were analyzed using culturing and PCR, and viruses were analyzed using PCR. The PCR kits used identify 18 types of respiratory viruses and 13 types of bacteria. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 30 of 31 aspirates (97%) using PCR, and none of the aspirates contained respiratory viruses alone. Ten aspirates (32%) contained both viruses and bacteria. The most common viruses detected were rhinovirus (13%) and influenza virus (10%). The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (32%), Moraxella catarrhalis (16%), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (13%).

Hypothalamic leptin receptor (LepR)- and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons are directly responsive to growth hormone (GH) and deletion of GH receptor (GHR) in these cells impairs neuroendocrine responses during situations of metabolic stress. In the present study, we determined whether GHR ablation in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells modifies acute and chronic metabolic adaptations to exercise. Male mice carrying deletion of GHR in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells were submitted to 8 weeks of treadmill running training. Changes in aerobic performance and exercise-induced metabolic adaptations were determined. Mice carrying GHR deletion in LepR cells showed increased aerobic performance after 8 weeks of treadmill training, whereas GHR ablation in SF1 cells prevented improvement in running capacity. Trained mice carrying GHR ablation in SF1 cells exhibited increased fat mass and reduced cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, deletion of GHR in LepR cells reduced fat mass and increased gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy, energy expenditure and voluntary locomotor activity in trained mice. Although glucose tolerance was not significantly affected by targeted deletions, glycemia before and immediately after maximum running tests was altered by GHR ablation. In conclusion, GHR signaling in hypothalamic neurons regulates the adaptation capacity to aerobic exercise in a cell-specific manner.

The aggressive behavior of this group of tumors justifies the need for a multidisciplinary team to assist in clinical decisions during the current pandemic. Brazil is now ranked #2 in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, and existing disparities in the treatment of neuro-oncology patients in Brazil will challenge the clinical and surgical decisions of this population, possibly affecting global survival. OBJECTIVE To search the literature about the management of glioblastomas during COVID-19 pandemic to guide surgical and clinical decisions in this population of patients in Brazil. METHODS We performed a systematic search on the PubMed electronic database targeting consensus statements concerning glioblastoma approaches during COVID-19 pandemic up to July 18, 2020. RESULTS When approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, important parameters that help in the decision-making process are age, performance status, tumor molecular profile, and patient consent. Younger patients should follow the standard protocol after maximal safe resection, mainly those with MGMT methylated tumors. Aged and underperforming patients should be carefully evaluated, and probably a monotherapy scheme is to be considered. Centers are advised to engage in telemedicine and to elaborate means to reduce local infection. CONCLUSION Approaching glioblastoma during the COVID-19 pandemic will be challenging worldwide, but particularly in Brazil, where a significant inequality of healthcare exists.","output":"Approaching glioblastoma during COVID-19 pandemic: current recommendations and considerations in Brazil."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure of bobcats (Lynx rufus) and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) to a range of common canine and feline pathogens was assessed in urban and rural zones of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, a National Park in the San Francisco Bay Area, (California, USA) from 1992 to 1995. Testing included serology for canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus, Leptospira interrogans, feline calicivirus (FCV), feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella henselae. Testing was also performed for Dirofilaria immitis. Significantly more gray foxes were seropositive for CPV in the urban zone than in the rural zone. In addition, radio-tracking of gray foxes in the rural zone indicated that all three of the rural CPV-seropositive foxes had traveled into adjoining small towns, whereas only one of the 11 seronegative animals had done so. Significantly more bobcats were seropositive for FCV in the rural zone than in the urban zone. Individual bobcats with positive FCV antibody titers had patterns of movement that intercepted park inholdings where domestic cats lived. Bobcat samples were seronegative for all five of the other viral feline pathogens, with the exception of a FECV-seropositive bobcat. High seroprevalence was detected for B. henselae and T. gondii in both zones. Variation in the seroprevalence for different pathogens might be related to differences in the exposure of bobcats and foxes to domestic animals: in the urban zone, gray foxes were located in residential areas outside the park, whereas bobcats were not. Although for most of the pathogens examined there was no relationship between urbanization and exposure, our results for CPV in foxes and FCV in bobcats indicated that proximity to urban areas or contact with humans can increase the risk of disease exposure for wild carnivore populations. Combining behavioral information from radio-tracking with data on pathogen exposure or disease incidence can provide valuable insights into the ecology of wildlife disease that might be missed with broad-scale, population-level comparisons alone.","output":"Exposure to feline and canine pathogens in bobcats and gray foxes in urban and rural zones of a national park in California."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the threat to the health and lives of patients with comorbid diseases. Infection by COVID-19 is especially detrimental to patients on hemodialysis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and prognoses of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 16 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were recruited from Wuhan Fourth Hospital from 5 February to 20 March 2020 for a retrospective, single-center study. A total of 62 non-dialysis patients with COVID-19 were the control group. We collected data on the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments, and clinical outcomes of patients affected by the virus. Results: Hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had a lower incidence of fever (P = 0.001) and relatively higher incidence of pre-admission comorbidities and shortness of breath than non-dialysis patients with COVID-19 (75% vs. 61%, P = 0.467 50% vs. 33.87%, P = 0.248 ). Hemodialysis patients had lower levels of hemoglobin (P < 0.001), white blood cell counts (P = 0.015), neutrophils (P = 0.016), AST (P = 0.037), ALT (P < 0.001) and procalcitonin (P < 0.001), and higher levels of D-dimer (P < 0.001) and thrombin time (P < 0.001). Hemodialysis patients had a higher incidence of pulmonary effusion, cord-like high-density shadows, pleural thickening, and atelectasis (P < 0.05). Hemodialysis patients also had relatively higher rates of mortality and prolonged hospital stays compared with the control group.

Forty years on, the progressive integration of bio- and nanotechnologies is starting to produce a transformation of the way we detect, treat and monitor diseases and unresolved medical problems [ 1]. While much of the work remains in research laboratories, the first nano-based treatments, vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic devices, are now receiving approval for commercialisation and clinical use. In this special issue we review recent advances of nanomedical approaches to combat antibiotic resistance, treatment and detection of cancers, targeting neurodegerative diseases, and applications as diverse as dentistry and the treatment of tuberculosis. We also examine the use of advanced smart nanostructured materials in areas such as regenerative medicine, and the controlled release of drugs and treatments. The latter is currently poised to bring ground-breaking changes in immunotherapy: the advent of vaccine implants that continuously control and improve immune responses over time.

As poor psychological health has been associated with sub-optimal glycaemic control and more frequent complications, there is an urgent need to develop more 'clinically usable' interventions. Digital mental health interventions offer unique advantages compared to in-person interventions, however, what adolescents with T1D want in terms of content and functionality is poorly understood. Accordingly, the current study conducted focus groups to examine the views of adolescents with T1D regarding digital mental health interventions. METHODS Four focus groups were conducted, including 16 adolescents with T1D, ranging from 13- to 17-years in age (69% female). Transcripts were analysed using directed content analysis to examine (1) 'what adolescents dislike about existing digital mental health interventions?' and (2) 'what adolescents want in future digital mental health interventions?'. RESULTS Findings provide a preliminary understanding of what adolescents dislike and also the type of content and functional features which may be important to include in digital mental health programs for this population, such as a peer support feature (reported by 16 of 16), emotion and diabetes check-in feature (11 of 16), and diabetes-relevant content (12 of 16). CONCLUSIONS Early data suggests that digital mental health interventions should include a significant peer support element, diabetes-relevant content and examples, and check-in on their mental health and diabetes self-management regularly, whilst avoiding fixed responses or modules and non-age appropriate content.

IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4. RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(-) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(-) and IgG(-) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(-), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4.

All participants were trained on Laerdel airway management trainer and were allowed 5 practice sessions with each scope with an intubation box while wearing face protective personal protective equipment (PPE). Participants were randomized into two groups of 15 each, one group performed the intubation first with McGrath and the other with C-MAC before crossing over. RESULTS: The mean (S.

Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the ?-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide valuable insights on the molecular basis of the specificity of ?-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface.

However, transmission model parameter estimation can be imprecise, and sometimes even impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not informative about all aspects of the mechanistic model. To partially overcome this obstacle, we propose a Bayesian modeling framework that integrates multiple surveillance data streams. Our model uses both SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics test and mortality time series to estimate our model parameters, while also explicitly integrating seroprevalence data from cross-sectional studies. Importantly, our data generating model for incidence data takes into account changes in the total number of tests performed. We model transmission rate, infection-to-fatality ratio, and a parameter controlling a functional relationship between the true case incidence and the fraction of positive tests as time-varying quantities and estimate changes of these parameters nonparameterically.

Despite this high number of infections, our results show that the abrupt end of the winter surge in January, 2021, was due to both behavioral changes and a high level of accumulated natural immunity.","output":"Semi-parametric modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Orange County, California using tests, cases, deaths, and seroprevalence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Household transmission has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the population-level growth of COVID-19. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) maintains data on positive tests for COVID-19 and the residential addresses of cases. We sought to use this information to characterise clusters of COVID-19 in multi-generational households in England. Methods Using cross-sectional design, cases of COVID-19 were assigned to clusters if they occurred in the same residential property in a 14-day rolling window. Patient demographic data were supplemented with reference to the ONS index of multiple deprivation and population density. Multi-generational households were defined as a cluster with at least three people, with one case in a person who was 0-16 years old and one case in a person who was [] 60 years old, with at least 16 years between two members of each age group. Results A total of 3,647,063 COVID-19 cases were reported between 01 April 2020 and 20 May 2021. Of these, 1,980,527 (54.3 %) occurred in residential clusters. Multi-generational households formed 1.5 % of clusters, with these more likely to occur in areas of higher population density and higher relative deprivation. Multi-generational clusters were more common among households of non-White ethnicity and formed larger clusters than non-multi-generational clusters (median cluster size 6, IQR 4-11 vs 3, IQR 3-4, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: To study the association of NSAID use with adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with influenza or influenza pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used propensity score matching among 7747 individuals aged 40 years or older who were hospitalized with influenza, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing, between 2010 and 2018. Data were collected using Danish nationwide registers. All analyses reported were performed on May 29, 2020. EXPOSURES: Prescription fill of an NSAID within 60 days before admission. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% CIs for intensive care unit admission and death within 30 days of admission. RESULTS: A total of 7747 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [59-80] years, 3980 [51.4%] men) with confirmed influenza were identified. Of these, 520 (6.7%) were exposed to NSAIDs. In the unmatched cohorts, 104 of 520 patients (20.0%) who used NSAIDs and 958 of 7227 patients (13.3%) who did not use NSAIDs were admitted to the intensive care unit. For death within 30 days of admission, we observed 37 events (7.1%) among those who used NSAIDs compared with 563 events (7.8%) among those who did not. Current NSAID use was associated with intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.81; RD, 6.7%; 95% CI, 3.2% to 10.3%), while NSAID use was not associated with death (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.26; RD, C0.7%; 95% CI, C3.0% to 1.6%). In the matched cohorts, risks were unchanged for patients who used NSAIDs, while 83 ICU admissions (16.0%) and 36 deaths (6.9%) were observed among matched individuals who did not use NSAIDs. Matched (ie, adjusted) analyses yielded attenuated risk estimates for intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.63; RD, 4.0%; 95% CI, C0.6% to 8.7%) and death (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.60; RD, 0.2%; 95% CI, C2.9% to 3.3%).

The approaches to contain the spread of the virus have entailed governments issuing recommendations on social distancing, lockdowns to restrict movements, and suspension of services. OBJECTIVE: There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis and the measures adopted by countries in response to the pandemic may have led to an upsurge in violence against children. Added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods and social isolation, may have led to a rise in childrens experience of violence in the home. Extended online presence by children may have resulted in increased exposure to abusive content and cyberbullying. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This study uses testimonial-based and conversational-based data collected from social media users. METHODS: Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to measure increases in abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to family violence before and after the start of the stayat-home restrictions. RESULTS: Violence-related subreddits were among the topics with the highest growth after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of Twitter data shows a significant increase in abusive content generated during the stay-at-home restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures offers insights into the wide-ranging risks that children are exposed to in times of crisis. As societies shift towards a new normal, which places emerging technology, remote working and online learning at its center, and in anticipation of similar future threats, governments and other stakeholders need to put in place measures to protect children from violence.","output":"Using social media data for assessing childrens exposure to violence during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given that being misinformed can have negative ramifications, finding optimal corrective techniques has become a key focus of research. In recent years, several divergent correction formats have been proposed as superior based on distinct theoretical frameworks. However, these correction formats have not been compared in controlled settings, so the suggested superiority of each format remains speculative. Across four experiments, the current paper investigated how altering the format of corrections influences peoples subsequent reliance on misinformation. We examined whether myth-first, fact-first, fact-only, or myth-only correction formats were most effective, using a range of different materials and participant pools. Experiments 1 and 2 focused on climate change misconceptions; participants were Qualtrics online panel members and students taking part in a massive open online course, respectively. Experiments 3 and 4 used misconceptions from a diverse set of topics, with Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers and university student participants. We found that the impact of a correction on beliefs and inferential reasoning was largely independent of the specific format used. The clearest evidence for any potential relative superiority emerged in Experiment 4, which found that the myth-first format was more effective at myth correction than the fact-first format after a delayed retention interval. However, in general it appeared that as long as the key ingredients of a correction were presented, format did not make a considerable difference. This suggests that simply providing corrective information, regardless of format, is far more important than how the correction is presented.

Method: This paper explores the determinant factors of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on Recife, Pernambuco-Brazil by performing both local and global spatial regression analysis on two types of environmental data-sets. Data were obtained from ten specific days between late April and early July 2020, comprehending the ascending, peak and descending behaviours of the curve of infections. Results: This study highlights the importance of identifying and mapping clusters of the most affected neighbourhoods and their determinant effects. We have identified that it is increasingly common for there to be a phase in which hotspots of confirmed cases appear in a well-developed and heavily densely-populated neighbourhood of the city of Recife. From there, the disease is carried to areas characterised by having a precarious provision of public services and a low-income population and this quickly creates hotspots of case-fatality rates. The results also help to understand the influence of the age, income, level of education of the population and, additionally, of the extent to which they can access public services, on the behaviour of the virus across neighbourhoods. Conclusion: This study supports government measures against the spread of Covid-19 in heterogeneous cities, evidencing social inequality as a driver for a high incidence of fatal cases of the disease. Understanding the variables which influence the local dynamics of the virus spread becomes vital for identifying the most vulnerable regions for which prevention actions need to be developed.","output":"An Environmental GIS-based Variable Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the City of Recife, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is currently decimating the world's most advanced technologies and largest economies and making its way to the continent of Africa.

This development sparks the growing use of telepresence robots, which allow students with prolonged sickness to interact with other students and their teacher remotely. Although telepresence robots are developed to facilitate virtual inclusion, empirical evidence is lacking whether these robots actually enable students to better cooperate with their fellow students compared to other technologies, such as videoconferencing. Therefore, the aim of this research is to compare mediated student interaction supported by a telepresence robot with mediated student interaction supported by videoconferencing. To do so, we conducted an experiment (N = 122) in which participants pairwise and remotely worked together on an assignment, either by using a telepresence robot (N = 58) or by using videoconferencing (N = 64). The findings showed that students that made use of the robot (vs. videoconferencing) experienced stronger feelings of social presence, but also attributed more robotic characteristics to their interaction partner (i.e., robomorphism). Yet, the negative effects of the use of a telepresence robot on cooperation through robomorphism is compensated by the positive effects through social presence. Our study shows that robomorphism is an important concept to consider when studying the effect of human-mediated robot interaction. Designers of telepresence robots should make sure to stimulate social presence, while mitigating possible adverse effects of robomorphism. ? Telepresence robots may facilitate student communication and cooperation. ? A telepresence robot increases social presence between students, facilitating communication and cooperation. ? Robomorphism is the attribution of more robot-like characteristics on an interaction partner. ? Communicating via telepresence robot increases feelings of robomorphism, hindering communication and communication.

Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were also evaluated in these 60 donors. Analyzed samples were collected at a median time of 62 (14C104) days from the day of first symptoms or positive PCR (for asymptomatic patients). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 88% and 87.8% of donors using the ELISA and the multiplex assay, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that age 50 years (p < 0.001) and need for hospitalization (p < 0.001) correlated with higher antibody titers, while asymptomatic status (p < 0.001) and testing >60 days after symptom onset (p = 0.001) correlated with lower titers. Interestingly, pseudotype virus-neutralizing antibodies (PsNAbs) significantly correlated with spike and with RBD antibodies by ELISA. Sera with high PsNAb also showed a strong ability to neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus, with hospitalized patients showing higher titers.

In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time formulated as a classification task, and if yes, the conversion time will be predicted formulated as a classification task. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of the high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across two tasks, i.e., the classification and the regression. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to jointly predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives. Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with 408 chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods.

This review summarizes the nano-enabled systems such as electrochemical nanobiosensor for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection and emphasizes promising diagnostic techniques to extensively facilitate the diagnostic practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, three main diagnostic methods have been widely used in the COVID-19 pandemic: nucleic acid (NA)-based testing, computed tomography (CT), and serological testing. NA-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 such as Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction has become the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review congregates significant contributions in the electrochemical nanobiosensor research area, which is helpful for further nanobiosensor development. Although many efforts were taken to detect the SARS-CoV-2, the COVID 19 diagnosis still relies on expensive prolonged analysis. A rapid and reliable alternative is the utilization of a low-cost nanobiosensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection that can rapidly diagnose the disease even in asymptomatic conditions with high reliability and sensitivity.","output":"Electrochemical nanobiosensors perspectives for COVID 19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 168 million people to be infected and 3 million people to die[1] .

We aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric patients with asthma and healthy children without chronic disease who infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a retrospective, case-control study comparing the asthma diagnosed and healthy children who were diagnosed as COVID-19 in our hospital between March 11 and November 10, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 6,205 children were diagnosed with CO-VID-19 in our hospital. Only 54 (0.87%) patients had a diagnosis of asthma. The mean of the age was 10.5 years and 53.7% (n:29) of the patients with asthma were male. Cough, shortness of breath, emesis, and diarrhea were found to be significantly higher in asthma group than in the control group (respectively p = 0.002, 0.000, 0.002, 0.019, 0.015). Patients who were given SABA was significantly higher in asthma diagnosed patients (p = 0.000).

However, social isolation measures have deeply changed their lifestyle, which is believed to have a psychological impact on them. The objective was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the emotional health of children and adolescents attending primary or secondary school. POPULATION AND METHODS Parents of children and adolescents from San Carlos de Bariloche participated in the study. Adults' perception of the emotional and behavioral impact of lockdown on children and adolescents, changes in sleeping habits, screen use, sports-related activities, eating, and medical consultations, was assessed. RESULTS A total of 267 parents were included. Of them, 96.3 % noticed emotional and behavioral changes. The most common ones were that their children were more bored (76.8 %), more irritable (59.2 %), more reluctant (56.9 %), and angrier (54.7 %). It was observed that they woke up and went to bed later, and slept 30 minutes more. Moreover, leisure screen use increased by 3 hours on weekdays. Time dedicated to physical activities did not change, but the type of activities did: swimming and team sports were replaced by biking, walking, and skiing.

For the 2021 residency match, the coronavirus-19 pandemic introduced complexity for programs and applicants because away rotations were limited and in-person interviews were cancelled. This may have changed the landscape in terms of expenses for candidates in important ways, but this topic has been insufficiently studied. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Given that in 2021, students did not attend away rotations and all interviews were held virtually, we asked (1) What were the financial savings associated with this change? (2) Was medical school geographic region associated with differences in expenses when applying to residency? METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of the 2020 and 2021 Texas Seeking Transparency in Application to Residency Dashboard database was performed. The data were derived from an online survey of a nationwide pool of applicants from 87% (123 of 141) of US allopathic medical schools upon conclusion of the match. The response percentage was 29% (521 of 1794). We believe this nationwide dataset represents the largest and most current data for this applicant group. Responses from applicants applying to orthopaedic surgery residency in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic application changes (2020) and during COVID-19 (2021) were queried and compared. After the orthopaedic surgery match, the database was evaluated for individual (application costs, away rotation expenses, and interview expenses) and total expenses for medical school seniors applying to orthopaedic surgery residency. Applicant characteristics were compared between application cycles. The 2020 to 2021 Texas Seeking Transparency in Application to Residency Dashboard database had 521 responses (n = 263 in 2020 and n = 258 in 2021) from applicants applying to orthopaedic surgery residency. Demographic and applicant characteristics were comparable between application cycles. Median expenses are reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons. A Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in expenses between years and between medical school regions at a p value threshold of < 0.05. RESULTS: For all applicants, the median total expenses (USD 7250 versus USD 2250), application costs (USD 2250 versus USD 1750), away rotation expenses (USD 2750 versus USD 250), and interview expenses (USD 2250 versus USD 75) declined in 2021 compared with 2020 (all p < 0.001). The median total savings in expenses for all applicants in 2021 compared with 2020 was USD 5000. In 2021, median total expenses were lower in all geographic regions with the greatest savings from applicants in the West (USD 6000); in addition, the difference in median total expenses between the geographic region with the highest total expenses and the lowest total expenses was lower in the pandemic year than it was in the year prior (USD 1000 versus USD 1500; p < 0.001). In 2021, there were differences in total expenses between the Northeast (USD 1750), West (USD 1750), and Central (USD 2750) regions (p < 0.001). From 2020 to 2021, only application fees from Northeast applicants differed (USD 2250 versus USD 1250; p < 0.001). In 2020, interview expenses were not different between all regions (USD 2250 Northeast and West versus USD 2750 Central and South; p = 0.19); similarly in 2021, interview expenses were similar between all regions (USD 75 versus USD 75; p = 0.82). Finally, in 2020, Northeast (USD 3250) and Western (USD 3250) applicants spent more for away rotations than Southern (USD 2750) and Central (USD 2250) applicants (p = 0.01). In 2021, applicants from schools in the South (USD 250) and Central (USD 250) regions spent more than their counterparts (USD 0; p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 application cycle, the median expenditures of orthopaedic residency candidates were USD 5000 lower than they were in the previous year; the difference can be attributed to the use of virtual interviews and the lack of away rotations. There are geographic implications, with applicants from Western United States medical schools potentially saving the most. Despite the financial savings during the 2021 match, further study related to the long-term success of the current application process (both for applicants and programs) is needed. The recommendation in May 2020 by the AOA Council of Orthopaedic Residency Directors (CORD) to limit the number of applications submitted by candidates with USMLE Step 1 scores greater than 235 did not result in any considerable decline in applications submitted or expenses. A better understanding of how differences in these expenses may influence our specialty's ability to attract socioeconomically diverse candidates would be important, and we need to explore perceived and actual financial obstacles to obtaining this diversity in the application process. Finally, avenues should be explored by program directors and chairpersons to reduce the expenses of the traditional application process while maintaining recruitment of top candidates.

Here, we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replication-competent smallpox vaccine (vaccinia Tiantan, VTT strain) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) through mucosal vaccination, which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs. Four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), oral (i.o.), and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations in mice. We found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of VTT was able to induce anti-VTT Nabs via each of the four routes. Higher levels of antiviral Nabs, however, were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. Moreover, the i.n. and i.o. vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of Nabs overtime, which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination. The VTT-induced immunity via all four routes, however, was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge.

The current study investigated youth sports development pathways through both models of development within a South African context. A descriptive quantitative cross-sectional design was used to generate a convenient sample of athletes (N = 267). The Talent Development Environment Questionnaire (TDEQ) was administered, which in previous studies produced acceptable psychometric properties. Principal factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Monte Carlo parallel simulation, MANOVA, and hierarchical regression were performed to analyze the data. The TDEQ was validated for the South African context and was found to measure four components, namely supportive and challenging environment, development fundamentals, support networks, and long-term development. Respondents in the various developmental categories of novice, advanced and elite student-athletes were not statistically significantly influenced by any of the four factors. Controlling for the talent developmental phase, the model proposed did not statistically significantly predict the development pathway of youth athletes. The results provide evidence with some practical significance as supportive and challenging environment and long-term development focus reported a small effect.

To elucidate the determinants that enable the P450s to be located in the ER, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric proteins in which a secretory form of carboxyesterase, carboxyesterase Sec, was connected to the N-terminus of the full-length or truncated forms of a microsomal-type P450, P45O(M1), and the constructed plasmids were expressed in COS cells. Since carboxyesterase Sec is an iV-glycosylated secretory protein, endo H treatment could be used to determine whether these chimeric proteins were located in the ER or not. Carboxyesterase Sec with the N-terminal 20 amino acids, containing the transmembrane region, of P46O(M1), was located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity of the expressed protein and immunofluorescence staining of the cells. As the expressed protein exhibited carboxyesterase activity, it was not retained in the ER through the BiP-dependent quality control system recognizing unfolded proteins. Another chimeric protein construct in which carboxyesterase Sec was connected to the C-terminal region of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), that contained a double-lysin ER retention motif, was also located in the ER, as determined from the endo H sensitivity and immunofluorescence staining. On the other hand, the sugar moiety of the carboxyesterase Sec connected to the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT, Sec/GTd, was partially resistant to the endo H treatment. From the results of immunofluorescent staining and cell fractiona-tion, it was concluded that the Sec/GTd product was located in the Golgi apparatus. These observations indicated that the N-terminal hydrophobic segment of P45O(M1) is sufficient for the ER membrane retention, whereas the transmembrane segment of UDP-GT is not. To determine whether microsomal P450s are recycled between the ER and Golgi compartments or not, a DNA construct encoding cathepsin D connected to the N-terminus of P45O(M1) was prepared and expressed in COS cells. The fusion protein was phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation was sensitive to alkaline phosphatase. As a control, authentic cathepsin D was subjected to phosphorylation of its oligosaccharide chain that was resistant to the alkaline phosphatase treatment. Since GlcNAc-P-transferase, which forms the alkaline phosphatase-resistant phosphodiester in the sugar chains of lysosome-targeting proteins, is located in the Golgi apparatus, it was concluded that the oligosaccharide chain of the cathepsin D portion of the fusion protein was not phosphorylated, and that the chimeric protein did not go to the Golgi apparatus. These results indicate that P45O(M1) is not recycled from the Golgi compartments to the ER in cells.","output":"The Transmembrane Region of Microsomal Cytochrome P450 Identified as the Endoplasmic Reticulum Retention Signal(1)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of the study was to assess mortality risk associated with co-morbidities and blood group type in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Jazan, Saudi Arabia Methods: This case & ndash;control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription & ndash;polymerase chain reaction The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio) The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis Results: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65 4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15 6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39 5 years, SD = 14 8) (p &lt; 0 001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0 06) Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9 4), hypertension (OR = 8 6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7 4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3 3), and obesity (OR = 2 0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19 Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0 07) Conclusion: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 Establishing the causality of death in patients with COVID-19 should be a key aim of future studies (c) 2021 The Author(s) Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4 0/)","output":"Co-morbidity and blood group type risk in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: A case & ndash;control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread in the worldwide population by contact with oral and respiratory secretions of infected individuals, imposing social restrictions to control the infection.

According to our data, there was an overall significant agreement ({kappa} coefficient value of 0.58) between the performances of saliva and NOP. Assuming that positive results in either sample represent true infections, 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva.

For signed language users, signing avatars could potentially provide accessible content by sharing information in the signer's preferred or native language. As the development of signing avatars has gained traction in recent years, researchers have come up with many different methods of creating signing avatars. The resulting avatars vary widely in their appearance, the naturalness of their movements, and facial expressionsall of which may potentially impact users' acceptance of the avatars. We designed a study to test the effects of these intrinsic properties of different signing avatars while also examining the extent to which people's own language experiences change their responses to signing avatars. We created video stimuli showing individual signs produced by (1) a live human signer (Human), (2) an avatar made using computer-synthesized animation (CS Avatar), and (3) an avatar made using high-fidelity motion capture (Mocap avatar). We surveyed 191 American Sign Language users, including Deaf (N = 83), Hard-of-Hearing (N = 34), and Hearing (N = 67) groups. Participants rated the three signers on multiple dimensions, which were then combined to form ratings of Attitudes, Impressions, Comprehension, and Naturalness. Analyses demonstrated that the Mocap avatar was rated significantly more positively than the CS avatar on all primary variables. Correlations revealed that signers who acquire sign language later in life are more accepting of and likely to have positive impressions of signing avatars. Finally, those who learned ASL earlier were more likely to give lower, more negative ratings to the CS avatar, but we did not see this association for the Mocap avatar or the Human signer. Together, these findings suggest that movement quality and appearance significantly impact users' ratings of signing avatars and show that signed language users with earlier age of ASL acquisition are the most sensitive to movement quality issues seen in computer-generated avatars. We suggest that future efforts to develop signing avatars consider retaining the fluid movement qualities integral to signed languages.","output":"Attitudes Toward Signing Avatars Vary Depending on Hearing Status, Age of Signed Language Acquisition, and Avatar Type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the moment, the shortcomings in the system of responding to crises in the health sector lie in the imperfection of the response order and management mechanisms The purpose of the paper is to investigate the legal regulation and reflection of public health emergencies in China, as exemplified by the case of 2019 coronavirus.

We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif at its polybasic (PRRA) insert to inhibit infection in live virus assays. The overlap between the superantigenic site of the spike and its proteolytic cleavage site suggests that the mAb prevents viral entry by interfering with the proteolytic activity of cell proteases (furin and TMPRSS2). The high affinity of 6D3 for this site originates from a polyacidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2. The study points to the potential utility of 6D3 for possibly treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common colds caused by human coronaviruses that also possess a furin-like cleavage site.","output":"A monoclonal antibody against staphylococcal enterotoxin B superantigen inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has disrupted medical education in the United Kingdom (UK). The pandemic may result in a long-term disproportionate negative impact to students applying to Medical School from a low-socioeconomic background. In addition, the upsurge in Medical School applications increases the likelihood of stricter University entry criteria over the coming years. There is no current research to determine how widening participation of Medicine to students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds can be improved virtually. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of COVID-19 on students enrolled in UK widening access schemes and the role of virtual student led initiatives in widening participation. Methods: A voluntary online survey was distributed to UK Sixth Form students (N=31) enrolled in a widening access scheme who attended Sheffield Neuroscience Society International Virtual Conference in February 2021. The event was free to attend. The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets and an educational manipulation check. Results: There were 30 pre-conference and 26 post-conference responses. 76.7% (N=23) had work experience cancelled due to COVID-19. A total of 36.7% (N=11) of participants reported participating in virtual work experience. Observe GP and Medic Mentor were each specified as attended virtual opportunities in 20% (N=6) of answers. Post conference, students felt significantly more confident in applying to Medical School (p=0.008) and more prepared to undertake a presentation (p=0.002). Educational manipulation check scores increased significantly (p=0.003). 100% of students felt inspired to do further CV building activities. Conclusion: COVID-19 has negatively impacted pupils enrolled in UK Medical School widening access schemes. Virtual student led initiatives can instill confidence in delegates from low socio-economic backgrounds, increase their career knowledge and inspire them to take part in further CV building exercises. Both Medical Schools and medical students play a key role in widening participation. This study recommends Medical Schools promote access to virtual events and act mindfully when determining students academic potential in the context of their socioeconomic and/or educational background.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on UK Medical School Widening Access Schemes: Disruption, Support and a Virtual Student Led Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spreading of Covid-19 and seeking for a drug that helps people around the world to cure this disease.In this article, we used a plant(Cassia fistula) which is rich in anthraquinone glycosides to control the causative agent.

However, rare cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2 vaccine) have been reported. Herein we systemically reviewed the reported cases of CVST and VITT following the COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We searched PubMed until May 19, 2021, and the following Keywords were used: COVID Vaccine & Neurology, AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID vaccine, AZD1222 COVID vaccine, Janssen COVID vaccine, Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine, Ad26.COV2 COVID vaccine. The authors evaluated the abstracts and titles of each article for screening and inclusion. English reports about post-vaccine CVST and VITT in humans were collected. RESULTS: Until May 19, we found 877 articles with the searched terms. We found 12 articles, which overall present clinical features of 36 patients with CVST and VITT after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Moreover, two articles were noted, which present 13 patients with CVST and VITT after Ad26.COV2 vaccine. The majority of the patients were females. Symptom onset occurred within one week after the first dose of vaccination (Range 4C19 days). Headache was the most common presenting symptom. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and/or Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were reported in 49% of the patients. The platelet count of the patients was between 5 and 127 cells10(9)/l, PF4 IgG Assay and d-Dimer were positive in the majority of the reported cases. Among 49 patients with CVST, at least 19 patients died (39%) due to complications of CVST and VITT. CONCLUSION: Health care providers should be familiar with the clinical presentations, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management consideration of this rare but severe and potentially fatal complication of the COVID-19 vaccination.

An autologous blood product containing a high percentage of various growth factors (GFs), cytokines and modulating factors as PRP has shown promising results in achieving this goal. METHODS One hundred and fifty-three patients (72 males, mean age 59.06  8.78, range 40-81 years old) from January 2018 to January 2020 received three consecutive PRP injections and completed the follow ups. Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), Knee society score (KSS) and Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) were evaluated before PRP injection (T0), one month (T1), three months (T2) and six months (T3) after the treatment. All patients underwent baseline and at 6 months MRI and X-ray evaluation. RESULTS A statistically significant VAS, KSS and WOMAC reduction emerged in the comparison between evaluations (p < 0.05), MRI demonstrated non-statistically significant improvement in cartilage thickness for both tibial plate and femoral plate (p = 0.46 and p = 0.33 respectively), and no radiographic changes could be seen in any patients.

RESULTS: 23 studies met inclusion criteria assessing knowledge (n=18, 78.3%), attitude (n=14, 60.9%) or skill (n=10, 43.5%) following medical student disaster training. No studies assessed clinical improvement. The length of studies ranged from 1 day to 28 days, and the median length of training was 2 days (IQR=1-14). Overall, medical student disaster training programmes improved student disaster and pandemic preparedness and resulted in improved attitude, knowledge and skills. 18 studies used pretest and post-test measures which demonstrated an improvement in all outcomes from all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing disaster training programmes for medical students improves preparedness, knowledge and skills that are important for medical students during times of pandemic. If medical students are recruited to assist in the COVID-19 pandemic, there needs to be a specific training programme for them. This review demonstrates that medical students undergoing appropriate training could play an essential role in pandemic management and suggests a course and assessment structure for medical student COVID-19 training.

We have earlier reported that cfChPs can readily enter into healthy cells to damage their DNA, activate apoptotic pathways and induce inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that repeated lifelong assault on healthy cells by cfChPs is the underlying cause of ageing, and that the ageing process could be retarded by deactivating cfChPs. The latter can be effected by oxygen radicals that are generated upon admixing the nutraceuticals resveratrol (R) and copper (Cu). Using confocal microscopy and antibodies against DNA and histone we detected copious presence of extra-cellular cfChPs in brain of ageing mice, and observed that these were deactivated / eradicated following prolong oral administration of small quantities of R-Cu. Deactivation / eradication of cfChPs was associated with down-regulation of several biological hallmarks of ageing in brain cells which included reduction in: 1) telomere attrition, 2) amyloid deposition, 3) DNA damage, 4) apoptosis, 5) inflammation, 6) senescence, 7) aneuploidy and 8) mitochondrial dysfunction. At a systemic level, R- Cu treatment led to significant reduction in blood levels of glucose, cholesterol and C-reactive protein. These results suggest that cfChPs may be global instigators of ageing and neurodegeneration, and that therapeutic use of R-Cu may help to retard the process of ageing.","output":"A pro-oxidant combination of resveratrol and copper down-regulates multiple biological hallmarks of ageing and neurodegeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease-specific online health communities provide a convenient and common platform for patients to share experiences, change information, provide and receive social support.

The social network was used to represent the users interaction and emotional flows to discover the differences in participation and emotional contagion patterns between psychological and physiological disease communities. The results revealed that people affected by depression focused more on their symptoms and social relationships, while people affected by diabetes were more likely to discuss treatment and self-management behavior. In the depression community, there were obvious interveners spreading positive emotions and more core users in the negative emotional contagion network. In the diabetes community, emotional contagion was less prevalent and core users in positive and negative emotional contagion networks were basically the same.

In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as cytokine storm. One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Initial experience from the outbreaks in Italy, China and the USA has anecdotally demonstrated improved outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 with the administration of cytokine-modulatory therapies, especially anti-IL-6 agents. Although ongoing trials are investigating anti-IL-6 therapies, access to these therapies is a concern, especially as the numbers of cases worldwide continue to climb. An immunology-informed approach may help identify alternative agents to modulate the pathological inflammation seen in patients with COVID-19. Drawing on extensive experience administering these and other immune-modulating therapies, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer offers this perspective on potential alternatives to anti-IL-6 that may also warrant consideration for management of the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary compromise that can be seen in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer perspective on regulation of interleukin-6 signaling in COVID-19-related systemic inflammatory response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : A surge in COVID-19 associated mucormycosis cases has been observed during the second COVID-19 wave, in summer 2021.

METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on pneumonia treatment using a combination of Yinqiao powder and western medicine was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP) and CBM. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005].

The five kits of Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection kit (RT-qPCR method) evaluated were Da An (Da An Gene Co., Ltd. of Sun Yat-sen University), Liferiver (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd.), Kinghawk (Beijing Kinghawk Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), eDiagnosis (Wuhan Easy Diagnosis Biomedicine Co., Ltd.), and Maccura (Maccura Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). Performance verification criteria included the coincidence rate, limit of detection (LoD), cross-reactivity, precision, and anti-interference. Finally, through the BDS performance verification reference product kit, clinical samples are used to verify its clinical diagnostic efficacy. RESULTS: The coincidence rate was 100% for all kits except for Kinghawk, which was 95%. The LoD for Da An, eDiagnosis and Maccura was 250copies/mL, and it was 1000 copies/ml for Liferiver. Kinghawk was not able to detect its advertised LoD of 500 copies/ml. The cross-reactivity test results were all negative. Moreover, all kits had a coefficient of variation less than 5%; however, Liferiver showed the best precision. Da An, Liferiver, and eDiagnosis showed higher sensitivity to the nucleocapsid (N) gene than they did to the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab genes. Anti-interference results for all five kits were positive. The results of clinical diagnostic efficacy were that the specificity of the four kits was 1.000 (0.877-1.000), the sensitivity of Da An was 1.000 (0.850-1.000), Liferiver was 0.964 (0.798-0.998), Maccura was 0.893 (0.706-0.972), and eDiagnosis was 0.857 (0.664-0.953).

A total of 517 articles (reviews and less relevant research papers) were excluded. A cumulative sum of thirty-one (31) research papers (20 clinical trials and 10 others) met the criteria and have been discussed in this review. Conclusion: The findings of this review suggest that phenolic compounds are the most promising phytochemicals in the management of COVID-19 and DM comorbidity. Curcumin and propolis have shown substantial evidence against COVID-19 and DM in humans and are thus, considered the best potential therapeutic options.","output":"Herbal medications and natural products for patients with covid-19 and diabetes mellitus: potentials and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented challenge to manage the bodies of the dead.

During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) state of emergency, lifestyle changes can cause psychological stressors and lead to poor sleep quality. This study examined whether sleep quality status was associated with low back or knee pain changes during the COVID-19 state of emergency among community-dwelling Japanese old-old adults. Design Cross-sectional investigation. Methods In July 2020, during the COVID-19 epidemic, we conducted a postal survey for old-old adults aged 77 years and collected data on 597 participants. For those who had low back or knee pain at the time of the survey (in July), characteristics such as low back pain, knee pain, changes in pain status, and sleep quality status during the COVID-19 state of emergency (in March) were assessed. Results Data from 597 participants showed the prevalence of low back pain (50.6%) and knee pain (40.7%) in July. Of those with low back or knee pain, 374 had pain changes during the state of emergency, with 12.3% worsening. Of these, 23.9% had poor sleep quality in March compared to non-change (p=0.008). In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, poor sleep quality was significantly associated with pain worsening (odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval 1.26C6.22). Conclusions During the COVID-19 state of emergency, poor sleep quality was associated with worsening low back or knee pain. This may indicate the need to pay attention to poor sleep quality to prevent the exacerbation of pain among old-old adults.","output":"Association of sleep quality status with worsening low back or knee pain during the COVID-19 state of emergency among old-old adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidrug resistance (MDR) can be a serious complication for the treatment of cancer as well as for microbial and parasitic infections. Dysregulated overexpression of several members of the ATP-binding cassette transporter families have been intimately linked to MDR phenomena. Three paradigm ABC transporter members, ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP) appear to act as brothers in arms in promoting or causing MDR in a variety of therapeutic cancer settings. However, their molecular mechanisms of action, the basis for their broad and overlapping substrate selectivity, remains ill-posed. The rapidly increasing numbers of high-resolution atomic structures from X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM of mammalian ABC multidrug transporters initiated a new era towards a better understanding of structureCfunction relationships, and for the dynamics and mechanisms driving their transport cycles. In addition, the atomic structures offered new evolutionary perspectives in cases where transport systems have been structurally conserved from bacteria to humans, including the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) family in fungal pathogens for which high resolution structures are as yet unavailable. In this review, we will focus the discussion on comparative mechanisms of mammalian ABCG and fungal PDR transporters, owing to their close evolutionary relationships. In fact, the atomic structures of ABCG2 offer excellent models for a better understanding of fungal PDR transporters. Based on comparative structural models of ABCG transporters and fungal PDRs, we propose closely related or even conserved catalytic cycles, thus offering new therapeutic perspectives for preventing MDR in infectious disease settings.","output":"Multidrug Resistance in Mammals and FungiFrom MDR to PDR: A Rocky Road from Atomic Structures to Transport Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Worsened cardiometabolic profiles in youth with mental ill health have been associated with a number of modifiable lifestyle risk factors. It is becoming increasingly evident that clinical interventions need to be multimodal in focus to improve mental health symptoms and the physical health symptoms in this already at-risk cohort. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 12-week pilot clinical trial examines the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of an adjunctive online psychoeducation programme for improving cardiometabolic risk parameters and affective symptoms in a transdiagnostic sample of at least 44 young people aged 16C25 years presenting for mental healthcare for mood and/or psychotic syndromes (including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and psychosis). Individuals will be invited to participate in a pilot clinical trial for a structured online psychoeducation programme incorporating nutritional, physical activity, sleepCwake and healthy lifestyle information, delivered fortnightly over six online modules. Participants will undergo a series of assessments including: (1) self-report and clinician administered assessments determining mental health symptomatology; (2) fasting blood tests to assess cardiometabolic markers (fasting insulin, fasting glucose and blood lipids); (3) anthropometric assessments (height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure); and (4) sleepCwake behaviours and circadian rhythm assessments. Changes in scores for all cardiometabolic and affective measures will be assessed via paired samples t-tests, and correlations between change scores will be assessed via Pearsons or Spearmans correlations. Feasibility will be assessed via completion rates, and the acceptability of the programme will be assessed via programme satisfaction measures.

Materials and Methods: Participants (n = 327 US women) completed an online survey assessing perceptions related to both of these reproductive health technologies, including usefulness, ease of use, risk, trust, subjective norms, and personal responsibility, to learn about fertility. Results: Participants indicated high perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and trust, as well as low perceptions of risk and subjective norms for both online fertility consultations (OFCs) and reproductive hormone SCTs. Women indicated low perceptions of responsibility to use OFCs, but high perceptions of responsibility to use reproductive hormone SCTs. Structural equation modeling indicated that intentions to use OFCs were predicted by usefulness, subjective norms, and responsibility; intentions to use reproductive hormone SCTs were predicted by usefulness, ease of use, subjective norms, and responsibility. Conclusions: Fertility specialist consultations and reproductive hormone testing can provide women with essential fertility information that facilitates informed reproductive decisions; however, these services have historically been difficult to access.

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome variables in this study are COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 deaths. The associations between sociodemographic characteristics and health access of COVID-19 infection and death were analysed using multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 14 264 samples, 551 individuals were confirmed as being infected with COVID-19; 62 individuals died of COVID-19. Women, individuals with direct contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases and individuals with hypertension constituted the groups most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Among respondents with confirmed COVID-19 cases, men, individuals aged 61 years and older, individuals with hypertension, and those diagnosed with pneumonia and respiratory failure were at higher risk of death. The number of community-based healthcare interventions was significantly associated with lower COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 mortality. Greater distance to a COVID-19 referral hospital increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection and death were related not only to sociodemographic characteristics of individuals but also to the presence of community-based healthcare interventions and access to hospital care.

Gout is associated with several comorbidities linked to poor outcomes in COVID-19, and gout flares can be triggered by some vaccinations. We analysed the risk of gout flares in the first 3 months after COVID-19 vaccination with inactivated virus, and whether colchicine can prevent gout flares following post-COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A clinical delivery population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Gout Clinic at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between February and October 2021. Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique among follow-up patients with gout. We collected data, including vaccinations and potential risk factors, using a combination of interviews, health QR codes and medical records. Logistic regression was used to adjust for covariates. RESULTS: We enrolled 549 gout participants (median age 39 years, 84.2% vaccinated). For the 462 patients who received COVID-19 vaccine, 203 (43.9%) developed at least one gout flare in the 3 months after vaccination. Most of these flares were experienced within 1 month after the first (99/119 (83.2%)) or second (70/115 (60.9%)) dose of vaccine. Compared with unvaccinated participants, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher odds of gout flare within 3 months (adjusted OR 6.02; 95% CI 3.00 to 12.08).

A previous cross-sectional study in middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort demonstrated that 45% of participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 77% of whom were symptomatic. Here, we assessed the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the above-mentioned rural population. One month after baseline testing, 362 of 370 initially seronegative individuals were re-tested to assess incidence of seroconversion and associated risk factors. Twenty-eight of them (7.7%) became seropositive. The overall incidence rate ratio was 7.4 per 100 person months of potential virus exposure (95% C.I.: 4.7-10.2). Six seroconverted individuals (21.4%) developed SARS-CoV-2-related symptomatology. The only covariate significantly associated with seroconversion was the use of an open latrine. Predictive margins showed that these individuals were 2.5 times more likely to be infected (95% C.I.: 1.03-6.1) than those using a flushing toilet. Therefore, along one month, approximately 8% of seronegative individuals became infected, even after almost half of the population was already seropositive. Nevertheless, a smaller proportion of incident cases were symptomatic (21% versus 77% of the earlier cases), and no deaths were recorded. Whether this decreased clinical expression resulted from a lower viral load in new infections cannot be determined. Increased seroconversion in individuals using latrines is consistent with a contributory role of fecal-oral transmission, although we cannot rule out the possibility that latrines are acting as a proxy for poverty or other unknown interacting variables.","output":"Late incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly-endemic remote rural village.

The aim of this review was to summarize the prevalence and the range of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, and to expose the main hypotheses about the pathogenic pathways based on available neuropathological studies. Methods: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to November 15, 2020, using a combination of COVID-19 and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles. Results: Nonspecific neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, pain and myalgia, have been reported in 2 to 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients. More severe neurological diseases affected 8 to 13% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients including various central or peripheral manifestations. Among central nervous system involvement, encephalopathy and cerebrovascular disease C especially ischemic stroke - were the most frequent, followed by encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Guillain-Barr syndrome and variants were the most common form of peripheral nervous system involvement, followed by critical illness neuromyopathy, plexopathy, polyneuropathy, oculomotor neuropathy, and Tapia syndrome. Encephalopathy, ischemic stroke and encephalitis occurred 6 to 12 days in median after the first signs of COVID-19, while Guillain-Barr syndrome occured later, at 15 to 23 days in median. Taste and smell disorders affected 34 to 86% of patients and occurred 3.5 days in median after the onset of infection. Pathogenic pathways of nervous system involvement in COVID-19 remain poorly understood. Neuropathological studies highlighted the possible role of sepsis and hypoxia, endothelial infection / dysfunction, inflammation and immune-mediated disease. While the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain was confirmed in some COVID-19 patients, there were no definite evidence to support its direct pathogenicity on brain parenchyma. Conclusion: Neurological involvement in COVID-19 is frequent and include various manifestations. Most of them are encephalopathies and strokes, probably linked to viral sepsis, hypoxia and/or endotheliitis.

The primary outcome was delivery before 34 weeks' gestation or stillbirth. The main secondary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes. Pregnancy outcomes were compared between women exposed to restriction measures and unexposed controls using the -square test and modified Poisson regression models, and duration of pregnancy was compared between the groups using survival analysis. RESULTS: In total, 3150 women who were exposed to restriction measures during pregnancy and 3175 unexposed controls were included. Preterm birth before 34 weeks or stillbirth occurred in 95 (3.0%) exposed pregnancies and in 130 (4.1%) controls (risk ratio (RR), 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57-0.96); P = 0.021). Preterm birth before 34 weeks occurred in 2.4% of women in the exposed group and in 3.4% of women in the control group (RR, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.95); P = 0.022), without evidence of an increase in the rate of stillbirth in the exposed group (0.7% vs 0.9%; RR, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.48-1.44); P = 0.515). Competing-risks regression analysis showed that the effect of the restriction measures on spontaneous preterm birth was stronger and started earlier (subdistribution hazard ratio (HR), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.64-1.03); P = 0.087) than the effect on medically indicated preterm birth (subdistribution HR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.70-1.12); P = 0.305). The effect was stronger in women with a previous preterm birth (RR, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21-0.82); P = 0.008) than in parous women without a previous preterm birth (RR, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63-1.38); P = 0.714) (P for interaction = 0.044). Composite adverse perinatal outcome was less frequent in the exposed group than in controls (all women: 2.1% vs 2.9%; RR, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.54-0.99); P = 0.042); women with a previous preterm birth: 4.5% vs 8.4%; RR, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.25-1.18); P = 0.116). CONCLUSIONS: Restriction measures implemented to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with a reduced rate of preterm birth before 34 weeks. This reduction was mainly due to a lower rate of spontaneous prematurity. The effect was more substantial in women with a previous preterm birth and was not associated with an increased stillbirth rate. ? 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on pregnancy duration and outcome in Melbourne, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Congenital lumbar hernia (LH) is a rare abdominal wall herniation and associated with lumbocostovertebral syndrome, including vertebral anomalies, costal defects and LH.

The patient underwent multiple cutaneous neurofibroma excisions before the treatment of LH. Recurrent neurofibroma and congenital aplasia of lumbar muscles at right flank may contribute to the patient's diffuse congenital LH development. Considering a large fascia defect (12 cm  15 cm) with absence of lumbar muscles at the herniation site, using mesh alone is not strong enough to stop the herniation of bowel. Transposition of right pedicled ALT-TFL-VL flap (35 cm  12 cm) with mesh was first attempted but proven to be futile, since the right lumbar wall bulged out from the distal border of previous reconstructed fascia. Thus, another free composite ALT-TFL-VL flap (35 cm  15 cm) from left thigh was transferred on top of the previous pedicled flap, followed by delayed free flap advancement and surgical mesh addition. Post-operative course was smooth without complications. Twenty-one months after the surgery, computed tomography showed no recurrence of LH.

Effects on apoptosis and neutrophil activity were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS G-CSF was significantly upregulated in nasal tissue and secretion fluid of type 2-low CRS patients compared to type 2-high patients. In nasal polyp tissue of type 2-low patients, a large infiltration of neutrophils expressing both G-CSF and its receptor was detected, suggesting the presence of a neutrophil-intrinsic autocrine survival mechanism. In response to G-CSF, neutrophils were in an activated state and were resistant to apoptosis, possibly contributing to a chronic inflammation. Of interest, type 2-high nasal polyp patients that were treated with IgE-blocking omalizumab had increased G-CSF concentrations compared to pre-treatment. CONCLUSION G-CSF is an important cytokine regulating neutrophils in type 2-low chronic rhinosinusitis, having potential in the diagnosis and therapy of the disease.","output":"Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor: Missing Link for Stratification of Type 2-high and Type 2-low Chronic Rhinosinusitis Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction : The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 represents a serious health issue worldwide, with more than 61 million cases and more than 1.4 million death since the beginning of the epidemic near the end of 2019. The scientific community strongly responded to this emergency situation with massive research efforts, mostly focused on diagnosis and clinical investigation of therapeutic solutions. In this scenario, drug repurposing played a crucial role in accelerating advanced clinical testing and shortening the time to access the regulatory review. Areas covered : This review covers the main and most successful drug repurposing approaches from a design, clinical, and regulatory standpoint. Available patents on repurposed drugs are also discussed. Expert opinion : Drug repurposing proved highly successful in response to the current pandemic, with remdesivir becoming the first specific antiviral drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. In parallel, a number of drugs such as corticosteroids and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while clinical testing of additional therapeutic options is ongoing. It is reasonably expected that these research efforts will deliver optimized and specific therapeutic tools that will increase the preparedness of health systems to possible future epidemics.","output":"Repurposing drugs for the management of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across supply chain (SC) operations worldwide. Specifically, decisions on the recovery planning are subject to multi-dimensional uncertainty stemming from singular and correlated disruptions in demand, supply, and production capacities. This is a new and understudied research area. In this study, we examine, SC recovery for high-demand items (e.g., hand sanitizer and face masks). We first developed a stochastic mathematical model to optimise recovery for a three-stage SC exposed to the multi-dimensional impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. This allows to generalize a novel problem setting with simultaneous demand, supply, and capacity uncertainty in a multi-stage SC recovery context. We then developed a chance-constrained programming approach and present in this article a new and enhanced multi-operator differential evolution variant-based solution approach to solve our model. With the optimisation, we sought to understand the impact of different recovery strategies on SC profitability as well as identify optimal recovery plans. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrated capability towards efficiently solving both small- and large-scale SC recovery problems. We tested, evaluated, and analyzed different recovery strategies, scenarios, and problem scales to validate our approach. Ultimately, the study provides a useful tool to optimise reactive adaptation strategies related to how and when SC recovery operations should be deployed during a pandemic. This study contributes to literature through development of a unique problem setting with multi-dimensional uncertainty impacts for SC recovery, as well as an efficient solution approach for solution of both small- and large-scale SC recovery problems. Relevant decision-makers can use the findings of this research to select the most efficient SC recovery plan under pandemic conditions and to determine the timing of its deployment.","output":"A mathematical model for managing the multi-dimensional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in supply chain of a high-demand item"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus SARS-COV-2 caused disease COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO.

In this review, we evaluate the role of fit checking and fit testing of respirators, in addition to airborne protection provided by respirators. Filtering facepiece respirators are made of material with sufficient high filter capacity to protect against airborne respiratory viruses. Adequate viral protection can only be provided by respirators that properly fit the wearer's facial characteristics. Initial fit pass rates vary between 40% and 90% and are especially low in female and in Asian healthcare workers. Fit testing is recommended to ensure a proper fit of respirators for the individual healthcare worker so that alternative respirators can be selected if required. Although fit testing is required to comply with respirator standards, it is not performed consistently within all healthcare settings. Fit checking (a self-test) is recommended every time a healthcare worker dons a respirator, but is unreliable in detecting proper fit or leak. Additionally, fit testing has a high educational value and as such is best performed as part of a hospital respiratory protection programme. Whether fit checking alone, as opposed to fit tested and fit checked respirators, provides adequate airborne protection against aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other respiratory viruses remains unknown. While fit testing undoubtedly incurs additional costs, it is still recommended, not only to protect healthcare workers but also as it may reduce overall healthcare cost when considering the potential costs of sickness leave and the associated legal costs of compensation.","output":"The role of fit testing N95/FFP2/FFP3 masks: a narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study sought to determine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 stay-at-home (SAH) and reopening orders on trends and types of firearm violence in California, Ohio, and the United States, hypothesizing increased firearm violence after SAH. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective data (January 1, 2018, to July 31, 2020) on firearm incidents/injuries/deaths and types of firearm violence were obtained from the Gun Violence Archive. The periods for SAH and reopening for the US were based on dates for California. Ohio dates were based on Ohio's timeline. Mann-Whitney U analyses compared trends and types of daily firearm violence per 100,000 legal firearm owners across 2018-2020 periods. RESULTS In California, SAH and reopening orders had no effect on firearm violence in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 periods, respectively. In Ohio, daily median firearm deaths increased during 2020 SAH compared with 2018 and 2019 and firearm incidents and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH. In the United States, during 2020, SAH firearm deaths increased compared with historical controls and firearm incidents, deaths and injuries increased during 2020 reopening compared with 2018, 2019 and 2020 SAH (all P < 0.05). Nationally, when compared with 2018 and 2019, 2020 SAH had increased accidental shootings deaths with a decrease in defensive use, home invasion, and drug-involved incidents. CONCLUSIONS During 2020 SAH, the rates of firearm violence increased in Ohio and the United States but remained unchanged in California. Nationally, firearm incidents, deaths and injuries also increased during 2020 reopening versus historical and 2020 SAH data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and CT data of 238 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our two hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred sixty-six patients (103 males; age 43.8  12.3 years) were allocated in the training cohort and 72 patients (38 males; age 45.1  15.8 years) from another independent hospital were assigned in the validation cohort. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was constructed based on the combination of clinical and CT features, and its prognostic performance was externally tested in the validation group. The predictive value of the combined model was compared with models built on the clinical and radiological attributes alone. RESULTS Overall, 35 infected patients (21.1%) in the training cohort and 10 patients (13.9%) in the validation cohort experienced adverse outcomes. Underlying comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-6.71; p < 0.001), lymphocyte count (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.38; p < 0.001) and crazy-paving sign (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03-4.48; p = 0.042) were the independent factors.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate COVID-19 mortality among this population. METHODS: Data on 50,038 people aged 25-59 years were collected from 38 agencies in Fars Province, Iran, from February 2020 to July 2021. Follow-up lasted from participants diagnosis with COVID-19 based on the results of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test to participants death or the end of the study period. The association between unemployment and COVID-19-related mortality was estimated using the Poisson regression method, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to calculate the E-value. RESULTS: Unemployment was associated with a 2.41-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01 to 2.90) higher age-adjusted and sex-adjusted risk of COVID-19-related mortality. The adjusted Poisson regression analysis showed 8.82 (95% CI, 6.42 to 12.11), 2.84 (95% CI, 1.90 to 4.24), and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.01) times higher risks of COVID-19-related mortality among unemployed people aged 25-39 years, 40-49 years, and 50-59 years, respectively, than among their employed counterparts. Unemployment increased the risk of COVID-19 mortality by 3.31 (95% CI, 2.31 to 4.74) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.86 to 2.84) times in female and male, respectively. The E-value was 3.43, reflecting the minimum strength of confounding required to shift the association between unemployment and COVID-19-related mortality toward the null.

In 2020, the WHO estimated that 8 million people have died due to smoking. Furthermore, smoking tobacco is a well-known risk factor for various infectious pulmonary diseases. The question raised, whether smoking is facilitating SARS-CoV-2-infections and increases adverse outcomes of COVID-19. To answer these questions a narrative review was conducted, finally including 7 systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in January and February 2021. Tobacco smoking was associated with an increased COVID-19 disease severity (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.55-2.19 and former vs. never smokers 1.20-2.48) and an increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.35-1.51 and former vs. never smokers 1.26-2.58). Beside immediate pulmonary toxic effects through active smoking, the cumulative livelong tobacco exposition and subsequent tobacco-associated diseases seem to predominantly predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data regarding an increased risk of infection among smokers is conflicting. However, a large observational study from England with 2.4 million persons reported an association between tobacco smoking and typical symptoms of COVID-19. For e-cigarettes and vaping less data exist, but experimental and first clinical investigations also suggest an increased risk for adverse outcomes for their use and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with limited therapeutic options it is particularly important to advise smokers of their increased risks for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Evidence based support for smoking cessation should be offered.

Trained immunity via reprogramming monocytes/macrophages has been reported to result in enhanced inflammatory status and antimicrobial activity against infection in sepsis. However, a safe and efficient way to induce trained immunity remains unclear. Methods: -glucan is a prototypical agonist for inducing trained immunity. Ferumoxytol, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) with low cytotoxicity, has been approved by FDA for clinical use. We synthesized novel nanoparticles BSNPs by coupling -glucan with SPIO. BSNPs were further conjugated with fluorescein for quantitative analysis and trace detection of -glucan on BSNPs. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and qRT-PCR, and the phagocytosis of macrophages was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The therapeutic effect of BSNPs was evaluated on the well-established sepsis mouse model induced by both clinical Escherichia coli (E. coli) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Results: BSNPs were synthesized successfully with a 3:20 mass ratio of -glucan and SPIO on BSNPs, which were mainly internalized by macrophages and accumulated in the lungs and livers of mice. BSNPs effectively reprogrammed macrophages to enhance the production of trained immunity markers and phagocytosis toward bacteria. BSNP-induced trained immunity protected mice against sepsis caused by E. coli and CLP and also against secondary infection. We found that BSNP treatment elevated Akt, S6, and 4EBP phosphorylation, while mTOR inhibitors decreased the trained immunity markers and phagocytosis enhanced by BSNPs. Furthermore, the PCR Array analysis revealed Igf1, Sesn1, Vegfa, and Rps6ka5 as possible key regulators of mTOR signaling during trained immunity. BSNP-induced trained immunity mainly regulated cellular signal transduction, protein modification, and cell cycle by modulating ATP binding and the kinase activity. Our results indicated that BSNPs induced trained immunity in an mTOR-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our data highlight that the trained immunity of macrophages is an effective strategy against sepsis and suggest that BSNPs are a powerful tool for inducing trained immunity to prevent and treat sepsis and secondary infections.","output":"-glucan-coupled superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles induce trained immunity to protect mice against sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 poses a higher risk of complications in obese patients due to low respiratory system compliance, increased inflammatory cytokines, and an activated immune system secondary to excess adiposity. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) has significant anti-inflammatory effects and reduces inflammatory cytokines. It is noninvasive and approved for pain management and musculoskeletal injuries. Data from human and experimental animal models of respiratory tract disease suggests that LLLT reduces inflammation and promotes lung healing. CASE AND OUTCOMES: A morbidly obese 32-year-old Asian female with severe COVID-19 received four consecutive once-daily LLLT sessions via a laser scanner. Pulsed 808 nm and 905 nm laser beams were delivered over the posterior chest for 28 min. The patient was evaluated before and after LLLT by radiological assessment of lung edema (RALE) on chest X-ray, oxygen requirements and saturation, pneumonia severity indices (SMART-COP and Brescia-COVID), blood inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, ferritin, and C-Reactive protein (CRP)). Prior to treatment, oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) via pulse oximetry was 88%C93% on 5C6 L oxygen. Following LLLT, SpO(2) increased to 97%C99% on 1C3 L oxygen. Reductions in RALE score from 8 to 3, Brescia-COVID from 4 to 0, and SMART-COP from 5 to 0 were observed. Interleukin-6 decreased from 45.89 to 11.7 pg/mL, ferritin from 359 to 175 ng/mL, and CRP from 3.04 to 1.43 mg/dL. Post-treatment, the patient noted appreciable improvement in respiratory symptoms.

One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.","output":"Neural basis of the visual working memory deficit in schizophrenia: Merging evidence from fMRI and EEG."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Failed airway management is the major contributor for anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. Cannot-intubate-cannot-ventilate scenarios are the most critical emergency in airway management, and belong to the worst imaginable scenarios in an anaesthetists life. In such situations, apnoeic oxygenation might be useful to avoid hypoxaemia. Anaesthesia guidelines recommend careful preoxygenation and application of high flow oxygen in difficult intubation scenarios to prevent episodes of deoxygenation. In this study, we evaluated the decrease in oxygen concentration in a model when using different strategies of oxygenation: using a special oxygenation laryngoscope, nasal oxygen, nasal high flow oxygen, and control. METHODS: In this experimental study we compared no oxygen application as a control, standard pure oxygen application of 10 lmin(? 1) via nasal cannula, high flow 90% oxygen application at 20 lmin(? 1) using a special nasal high flow device, and pure oxygen application via our oxygenation laryngoscope at 10 lmin(? 1). We preoxygenated a simulation lung to 97% oxygen concentration and connected this to the trachea of a manikin model simulating apnoeic oxygenation. Decrease in oxygen concentration in the simulation lung was measured continuously for 20 min.

In a subgroup of parturients vaccinated in the 1 (st) trimester (n=30), a third booster dose was associated with significantly higher maternal and neonatal antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a considerable antibody waning throughout pregnancy in those vaccinated at early gestation. The observed boosting effect of a third vaccine dose, hints to its potential benefit in those who completed the two-dose vaccine series at early pregnancy or prior to conception.

This study describes a quality improvement project to prevent ETT occlusion in critically ill patients. METHODS: After a cluster of clinically significant ETT occlusion incidents at a tertiary-care intensive care unit (ICU), the root cause analysis suggested that the universal use of heat moisture exchangers (HMEs) was a major cause. Then, we prospectively audited new ETT occlusion incidents after changing our practices to evidence-based active and passive humidification during mechanical ventilation (MV). We also compared the outcomes of affected patients with matched controls. RESULTS: During 100 weeks, 18 incidents of clinically significant ETT occlusion occurred on a median of 7 days after intubation (interquartile range, 4.8C9.5): 8 in the 10 weeks before and 10 in the 90 weeks after changing humidification practices (8.1 vs. 1.0 incidents per 1000 ventilator days, respectively). The incidents were not suspected in 94.4%, the peak airway pressure was >30 cm H(2)O in only 25%, and 55.6% were being treated for pneumonia when ETT occlusion occurred. Compared with 51 matched controls, ETT occlusion cases had significantly longer MV duration (median of 13.5 vs. 4.0 days; P = 0.002) and ICU stay (median of 26.5 vs. 11.0 days; P = 0.006) and more tracheostomy (55.6% vs. 9.8%; P < 0.001). The hospital mortality was similar in cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of ETT occlusion decreased after changing humidification practices from universal HME use to evidence-based active and passive humidification.

Many efforts have revealed that some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions containing Ephedra sinica could effectively alleviate the symptoms and prevent the fatal deterioration of COVID-19. Aim of the study: The present study aims to discover active compounds in Ephedra sinica disrupting the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 RBD) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanol extracts of Ephedra sinica were prepared. Activity guided isolation of constituents was carried out by measuring the inhibitory activity on ACE2-RBD interaction. The structures of active compounds were identified by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and NMR. To testify the contribution of main components for the inhibitory activity, different samples were prepared by components knock-out strategy. The mechanism of compounds inhibiting protein-protein interaction (PPI) was explored by competition inhibition assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and molecular docking. SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudoviruses were used to observe the viropexis effect in cells. RESULTS: Ephedra sinica extracts (ESE) could effectively inhibit the interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (IC(50) = 95.01 g/mL). Three active compounds, 4,6-dihydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid, 4-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid and 4-hydroxy-6-methoxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid were identified to inhibit ACE2-RBD interaction (IC(50) = 0.58 M, 0.07 M and 0.15 M respectively). And knock-out the three components could eliminate the inhibitory activity of ESE. Molecular docking calculations indicated that the hydrogen bond was the major intermolecular force. Finally, our results also showed that these compounds could inhibit the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudoviruses to 293T-ACE2 (IC(50) = 0.44 - 1.09 M) and Calu-3 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that quinoline-2-carboxylic acids in Ephedra sinica could be considered as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19.

These effects differed among cities, but these differences have not been adequately studied. To provide more knowledge, we studied the air quality index (AQI) and five air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tangshan. The pollution data from two types of monitoring stations (traffic and non-traffic stations) were separately compared and evaluated. We used monitoring data from the traffic stations to study the emission reduction caused by traffic restrictions. Based on monitoring data from the non-traffic stations, we established a difference-in-difference model to study the emission reduction caused by production suspension. The COVID-19 control measures reduced AQI and the concentrations of all pollutants except O(3) (which increased greatly), but the magnitude of the changes differed among the three cities. The control measures improved air quality most in Wuhan, followed by Shanghai and then Tangshan. We investigated the reasons for these differences and found that differences in the characteristics of these three types of cities could explain these differences in spillover effects. Understanding these differences could provide some guidance and support for formulating differentiated air pollution control measures in different cities. For example, whole-process emission reduction technology should be adopted in cities with the concentrated distribution of continuous process enterprises, whereas vehicles that use cleaner energy and public transport should be vigorously promoted in cities with high traffic development level.","output":"Diverse spillover effects of COVID-19 control measures on air quality improvement: evidence from typical Chinese cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence and rapid global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose an unprecedented medical and socioeconomic crisis, and the disease caused by it, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.

This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible 'lockdown' effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. METHODS: Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (February 16, 2020 to March 15, 2020), and after UK government advice (March 16, 2020 to April 15, 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (pa?<a?0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade &#8805;3 complications (pa?=a?0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, pa?=a?0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality.

We then present a game-theoretic model where nodes choose their activation probabilities in a strategic manner using current state information as feedback, and characterize the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) of the proposed setting. We then consider the activity-driven susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model, characterize equilibrium activation probabilities and analyze epidemic evolution in closed-loop. Our numerical results provide compelling insights into epidemic evolution under game-theoretic activation. Specifically, for the SAIR epidemic, we show that under suitable conditions, the epidemic can persist, as any decrease in infected proportion is counteracted by an increase in activity rates by the nodes. For the SIS epidemic, we show that in regimes where there is an endemic state, the infected proportion could be significantly smaller under game-theoretic activation if the loss upon infection is sufficiently high.","output":"Impacts of Game-Theoretic Activation on Epidemic Spread over Dynamical Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From Ebola virus outbreaks in Western Africa to the introduction of chikungunya and Zika viruses in the Americas, new and neglected viruses continue to emerge and spread around the world.

This inhibition was prevented by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium, indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In contrast, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3 h post-infection) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mRNAs were significantly affected by pretreatment with MCD, but not by treatment at 3 h post-infection. Interestingly, no apparent evidence for colocalization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with lipid rafts in the membrane of Vero E6 cells was obtained.

METHOD A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 11 to March 09, 2021 and concerned healthcare professionals in Algeria, through an online self-assessment. The mental health rating scales used were GAD-7 (7 items) for Anxiety, and CES-D (20 items) for Depression. Resilience was estimated by the RISC-CD (10 items). An original questionnaire was used to assess three factors: fear of infection and death, isolation and stigmatization, as well as motivation and escape behaviour at work. RESULTS A total of 1005 health professionals were included in the study, of which 51.5% were doctors, 75.6% were women and 41.1% were at the first front of the fight against COVID-19. The prevalence of Anxiety and Depression was 23.8% and 44.6% respectively.

Although it has been suggested that these drugs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, experimental data suggest these agents may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation and fibrosis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of medications that influence ACE2 expression (ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones) on the outcomes of COVID-19? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 24 June 2020. After systematic analysis, nine studies were included. RESULTS: The results were described for two different groups, an overall group in which all users were compared with non-users and a group in which only hypertensive patients were included. Within each group a distinction was made between results for ACEI/ARB use, ACEI use, ARB use, NSAID use and thiazolidinedione use. None of the studies demonstrated increased mortality in the two groups. Furthermore, none of the studies showed an effect on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'moderate' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature demonstrated that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of ACE2 expression mediating pharmacotherapy on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies.

The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the cumulative exposure time, the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19.

Several Omicron sublineages (BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2) have been identified, with in vitro and preclinical reports showing that the pathogenicity and therapeutic efficacy differs between BA.1 and BA.2. We sought to develop a TaqMan assay to identify these subvariants. Methods A TaqMan assay was constructed for rapid identification and genotyping of Omicron sublineages. We analyzed three characteristic mutations of the spike gene, {Delta}69-70, G339D and Q493R, by TaqMan assay. The accuracy of the TaqMan assay was examined by comparing its results with the results of whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. Results A total of 169 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were analyzed by WGS and TaqMan assay. The 127 samples determined as BA.1/BA.1.1 by WGS were all positive for {Delta}69-70, G339D and Q493R by TaqMan assay. Forty-two samples determined as BA.2 by WGS were negative for {Delta}69-70 but positive for G339D and Q493R by TaqMan. The concordance rate between WGS and the TaqMan assay was 100% (169/169).

While there have been a few recent case reports of laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy performed as an option for surgical treatment, the role of the da Vinci(?) robot in superior mesenteric syndrome has been underestimated. The authors report a robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy for the treatment of SMA syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 39-year-old man with a history of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presented with an upper gastrointestinal obstruction with distended abdomen. A computed tomography scan showed a transition in the third portion of the duodenum where the SMA vessels crossed over, with a decompressed jejunum. He was identified as a candidate for a duodenojejunostomy. The da Vinci Surgical System was used to mobilize the colon and duodenum, and a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy was performed with hand-sewn anastomosis. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications. The blood loss was minimal and operative time was 120 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful with resolution of intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION Robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy as a surgical option for treatment of SMA syndrome is safe, feasible, and a valid alternative to open surgery with the added benefits of a minimally invasive approach.","output":"Robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy for superior mesenteric artery syndrome: operative technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new kind of Pneumonia caused by new corona virus has been widespread in China since winter of 2019.

IL4I1 expression in human cancer is frequent and correlates with poor survival and resistance to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, its mechanism of action remains partially unknown. Here, we identified transmembrane serine protease 13 (TMPRSS13) as an immune cell-expressed surface protein that binds IL4I1. TMPRSS13 is a paralog of TMPRSS2, whose protease activity participates in the cleavage of SARS-Cov2 Spike protein and facilitates virus induced-membrane fusion. We show that TMPRSS13 is expressed by human lymphocytes, monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, can cleave the Spike protein and allow Sars-Cov2 Spike pseudotyped virus entry into cells. We identify regions of homology between IL4I1 and Spike and demonstrate competition between the two proteins for TMPRSS13 binding. These findings may be relevant for both interfering with SARS-Cov2 infection and limiting IL4I1-dependent immunosuppressive activity in cancer.

Platelets play a vital part in evading immune surveillance and angiogenesis in the case of tumor metastasis. The study aimed to analyze the predictive and prognostic effects of platelet count on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed the prognostic effects of platelets on 52 NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant following EGFR-TKI treatment. Related data, together with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected before and after 2 cycles of treatments (60 days). RESULTS The anti-EGFR treatment markedly reduced the platelet count in 33 (63.5%) patients after 2 cycles of treatment. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that, the decreased platelet count was closely correlated with the longer OS (HR = 0.293; 95%CI: 0.107-0.799; p = 0.017). Besides, the median OS was 326 days in the decreased platelet count group and 241 days in the increased platelet count group (HR = 0.311; 95%CI: 0.118-0.818; P = 0.018), as obtained from the independent baseline platelet levels and other clinical features.

Georgia announced a state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) of COVID-19 in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and environs from March 2, 2020, to November 20, 2020. METHODS: We analyzed the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and its surrounding counties, and estimated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. We used a 9-day correction for the date of report to analyze the data by assumed date of infection. RESULTS: The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March to < 2 in late March to around 1 from mid-April to November. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. Then, Rt fluctuated around 1 in May through November. Counties surrounding Dougherty County registered an increase in Rt estimates days after a superspreading event occurred in the area. CONCLUSIONS: In Spring 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, because restrictions were relaxed in late April and elections were conducted in November, community transmission continued, with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of November 2020.

Chi-square, Spearmen correlation test, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression tests were used when comparing. RESULTS: Our participants ages were between 21 and 88, with a mean age of 61.38 (SD = 11.68), 48.6% (n = 251) of the participants were female. We discovered that 79.1% (n = 408) of respondents were not afraid of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. 27.7% (n = 143) of these patients were concerned about the COVID-19 vaccines adverse effects, and 24.2% (n = 125) were afraid of its side effects with their treatments. 91.1% (n = 470) of the patients did not know which vaccine they would have and the type of the vaccine. Since the anxiety level is generally higher in women, anxiety scores were also higher in cancers seen in women, such as breast and ovarian cancer.

Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Methods To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry. Results Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy. Conclusions A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for the prediction of severe COVID-19 outcome and identify and validate a set of blood and physiological parameters routinely collected at hospital admission to improve upon the use of NEWS2 alone for medium-term risk stratification. METHODS: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to Kings College Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 March to 30 April 2020. External validation cohorts included 6237 patients from five UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham), one hospital in Norway (Oslo University Hospital), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID-19 disease (transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. RESULTS: A baseline model of NEWS2 + age had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID-19 infection at 14 days (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in training cohort = 0.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192, 95% CI 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI 0.715, 0.757), and these improvements were replicated across seven UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites.

The proposed continuum deformation model is used to learn the parameters of pandemic growth based on the training data of total cases, deaths, and recoveries in each state of the United States from March 12, 2020 to January 28, 2021. Using this approach, multiple periods of the nationwide and State-level pandemic growth patterns are discovered and analyzed.","output":"A Continuum Deformation Approach for Growth Analysis of COVID-19 in the United States"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/21.md","filePath":"consultation/21.md"}'),V={name:"consultation/21.md"},E=Object.assign(V,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(R)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
